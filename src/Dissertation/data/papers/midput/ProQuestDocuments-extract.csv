In physiotherapy training, particularly in technically complex subjects like electrotherapy, conventional instruction may fall short in fostering active learning and knowledge retention. Game-based platforms such as Ren'Py offer an opportunity to integrate interactive, scenario-based learning into the curriculum. This study aimed to assess the impact of Ren'Py-based digital materials on learning outcomes by comparing conventional, digital, and hybrid teaching models in an undergraduate electrotherapy course.This single-blind, three-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted between October-December 2024 at the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. Eighty second-year physiotherapy students who had not previously taken the course were randomly assigned via computerized sequence to one of three groups: Conventional Education Group (CEG, n = 23), Digital Education Group (DEG, n = 29), or Conventional and Digital Education Group (CaDEG, n = 28). Instructional delivery included theoretical and practical sessions, followed by theoretical and practical exams. Outcomes included exam scores, the Cognitive Load Scale, the Attitude Scale Towards the Physiotherapy Profession, and the Educational Materials Motivation Survey. The data were analyzed using SPSS 27.0 package program. The parametric ANOVA test was used for normally distributed data, and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used for nonnormally distributed data. Post-hoc analyses were performed using the Bonferroni test for normally distributed data and the Dunn-Bonferroni test for non-normally distributed data. A p < 0.05 level of significance was accepted for all findings.

Design/methodology/approach We collected data from 389 Chinese employees across three stages and used hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrap method to test our hypotheses. Findings Communication visibility negatively affects knowledge sabotage, and the loss of knowledge power mediates the relationship between communication visibility and knowledge sabotage. Digital work connectivity strengthens the negative relationship between message transparency and loss of knowledge power but weakens the negative relationship between network translucence and loss of knowledge power. Therefore, digital work connectivity plays a dual role. Practical implications Managers can encourage employees to share their knowledge advantages through ESM and seek cross-disciplinary knowledge cooperation, which helps restrain knowledge sabotage from the source. At the same time, maintaining appropriate digital work connectivity enables employees to leverage their knowledge interaction advantages of ESM, thereby fostering their knowledge competitiveness. Originality/value This study is the first to reveal the internal mechanism (loss of knowledge power) through which ESM communication visibility affects knowledge sabotage and explores the boundary condition (digital work connectivity) impacting the effectiveness of communication visibility.

17,The combined impact of AI and VR on interdisciplinary learning and patient safety in healthcare education: a narrative review,"Chance, Emmanuel Aoudi11 VID Specialized University, Bergen, Norway (GRID:grid.463529.f)","Introduction The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience. Methods This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics. Results The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning ( n  = 17), immersive skill development ( n  = 10), teamwork enhancement ( n  = 10), patient safety ( n  = 18), and ethical considerations ( n  = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments.

It examines research methodologies, data collection tools, sample sizes, and data analysis methods, focusing on subject areas and types of board games used. Key findings reveal a predominance of physical (paper‐based) board games. Research methodologies were primarily quantitative, with descriptive analysis being the most common approach, typically employing varied sample sizes (median 48.5 participants). Evidence suggests that board games can enhance scientific knowledge acquisition, improve student engagement, and foster collaborative skills. However, the review identifies critical limitations in the existing literature, including a prevalence of small sample sizes, a lack of long‐term effectiveness studies, and insufficient focus on specific game mechanisms. Future research should prioritise investigating game mechanisms, explicitly measuring collaborative learning outcomes, improving methodological rigour, and assessing long‐term impacts on knowledge retention. Context and implications Rationale for this study: This systematic review addresses a gap by synthesising empirical evidence on board games for collaborative learning in science education, providing a comprehensive overview of existing research. Why the new findings matter: Our findings quantify board games' positive impacts on science knowledge, engagement, and collaborative skills, while identifying methodological gaps and crucial future research directions. Implications for educational institutions, policymakers, educators and learners: This review highlights effective practices for integrating board games into science education, guiding the creation of more engaging and impactful collaborative learning experiences. For researchers: It identifies critical gaps in the literature, emphasising the need for studies on specific game mechanisms, long‐term effectiveness, enhanced methodological rigour (e.g. control groups, inferential statistics), and exploration across diverse populations and digital technologies.

Educators and developers can apply these insights to sequence VR after foundational instruction and incorporate cognitive load-aware design features such as signaling and guided narration. The results support using VR as a complementary tool within blended learning frameworks, helping institutions and industry trainers enhance learner focus, retention, and practical skill development while minimizing cognitive overload. As immersive technologies increasingly permeate education and professional training, their cognitive implications for novice learners remain underexplored. This study examines the relative effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based instruction compared with conventional teaching modalities in a controlled experimental setting.

Many firms have suffered significant losses due to their failure to address the issue of knowledge loss, which has become a major challenge affecting their survival and development. To prevent and manage technical knowledge loss in firms, this study proposes an invulnerability analysis model for the firms’ technical knowledge network (FTKN) is first proposed based on complex networks. Key invulnerability metrics such as network connectivity, average risk path, and network risk efficiency are defined according to the unique characteristics of FTKN. Besides, the invulnerability of FTKN is analyzed based on the simulation analysis of random attacks and deliberate attacks. Additionally, a node importance evaluation method is introduced, incorporating factors such as degree value, betweenness centrality, efficiency, and the contributions of adjacent nodes. To enhance the survivability of FTKN, the network structure is optimized through redundant design. Simulation results demonstrate that external deliberate attacks and technical blockades cause more damage to the system compared to attacks on strongly correlated technologies. From a short-term perspective, prioritizing the protection of nodes with high betweenness can greatly improve the invulnerability of the network. Conversely, from a long-term perspective, the protection strategy of firms for moderate technology nodes is more conducive to the connectivity of the entire technology evolution network.

However, its development is constrained by two major bottlenecks: weak few-shot generalization capability stemming from the scarcity of high-quality annotated data and the problem of catastrophic forgetting when continually learning new knowledge. Existing research has largely addressed these two challenges in isolation, lacking a unified framework. Methods: To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel Evolvable Clinical-Semantic Alignment (ECSA) framework, designed to synergistically solve these two challenges within a single architecture. ECSA is built upon powerful pre-trained vision (BiomedCLIP) and language (Flan-T5) models, with two innovative modules at its core. First, we design a Clinical-Semantic Disambiguation Module (CSDM), which employs a novel debiased hard negative mining strategy for contrastive learning. This enables the precise discrimination of ""hard negatives"" that are visually similar but clinically distinct, thereby significantly enhancing the model's representation ability in few-shot and long-tail scenarios. Second, we introduce a Prompt-based Knowledge Consolidation Module (PKC), which acts as a rehearsal-free non-parametric knowledge store. It consolidates historical knowledge by dynamically accumulating and retrieving task-specific ""soft prompts,"" thus effectively circumventing catastrophic forgetting without relying on past data. Results: Extensive experimental results on four public benchmark datasets, VQA-RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-Med-2019, demonstrate ECSA's state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance. Specifically, ECSA achieves excellent overall accuracies of 80.15% on VQA-RAD and 85.10% on SLAKE, while also showing strong generalization with 64.57% on PathVQA and 82.23% on VQA-Med-2019. More critically, in continual learning scenarios, the framework achieves a low forgetting rate of just 13.50%, showcasing its significant advantages in knowledge retention.

31,The potential of human-machine collaborative learning in educational virtual environments for knowledge retention in science learners: A decade-long meta-analysis,"Chen, Gaoyu; Oubibi, Mohamed    ; Zhou, Yueliang; Li, Yunlu; Wang, Haijun; Gao, Yan","Educational virtual environments (EVEs), constructed through virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), serve as digital learning spaces that provide crucial support for applying human-machine collaborative learning in science education. In science education, knowledge retention is the foundation for students to understand complex scientific concepts and to conduct further inquiry-based practices, directly influencing the long-term development of scientific literacy. However, there remains academic debate regarding whether EVE-based human-machine collaborative learning can effectively enhance knowledge retention, and its core mechanisms have yet to be systematically clarified. This study employs a meta-analysis approach to synthesize 80 experimental and quasi-experimental studies (including 88 effect sizes) conducted between 2014 and 2024, examining the impact of EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning on science learners' knowledge retention. The results indicate that compared with traditional learning methods, EVEs-based human-machine collaborative learning has significant potential to improve knowledge retention. Although no statistically significant differences were found across moderating variables such as educational level and technology type, environments built with VR technology, high school contexts, operational learning, and presentation-based instructional approaches demonstrated more pronounced effects on knowledge retention. Subgroup analysis of instructional methods further revealed that their effectiveness is moderated by factors such as testing formats and educational levels. Accordingly, researchers and educational practitioners are encouraged to adopt systematic thinking in designing instructional practices, explore effective teaching methods, and apply diversified assessments to continuously monitor long-term impacts. This study aims to provide both theoretical insights and practical guidance for science educators to optimize EVEs-based instructional strategies and enhance knowledge retention.

By employing a grounded theory approach, this study aimed to develop a theoretical framework that explains how multimedia-based instruction influences EFL learners' cognitive processes during listening tasks. Two higher education institutions were chosen based on the consideration that they have experienced the use of multimedia in teaching and learning EFL listening skills. Twenty-four students were selected for a theoretical sampling with an open sampling pattern to help researchers form the best theory. To enhance the understanding of the phenomenon, participant observation and semi-structured interviews served as the primary data collection techniques in this study. The researchers directly observed the process of teaching listening and then proceeded with a semi-structured interview. This study had three stages of the data analysis process: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. The results indicated the cognitive effects of multimedia-based instruction on students' listening skills include improved comprehension and enhanced knowledge retention. It also developed a theory that links educational technology, cognitive psychology, and language acquisition through data analysis using the grounded theory method.

As digital natives, GenZ learners-born between 1995 and 2010-exhibit distinct preferences for interactive, technology-driven, and self-directed learning, rendering traditional lecture-based models increasingly obsolete. This scoping review explores the pedagogical implications of GenZ's learning traits and advocates for a generational shift in orthopedic education to align with their cognitive styles and career aspirations. GenZ students thrive in environments that use digital tools such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and gamified platforms, which provide immersive, risk-free surgical simulations and improve procedural mastery. Microlearning techniques, including bite-sized videos and infographics support their shorter attention spans and improve retention of complex topics like fracture classifications and biomechanics. Collaborative learning strategies, such as team-based problem-solving and peer-teaching models, resonate with their preference for social interaction and teamwork. Additionally, adaptive learning systems powered by artificial intelligence offer personalized study plans, addressing individual strengths and weaknesses. The review demonstrates the importance of early clinical exposure and simulation-based training to bridge theory and practice, encouraging pragmatic, career-ready professionals. Educators, particularly millennials, must embrace digital fluency and mentorship to create learner-centered environments. By integrating these innovations-flipped classrooms, gamification, and on-demand resources-orthopedic education can lead to engagement, knowledge retention, and clinical preparedness.

Email: mash@iitm.ac.in","Although virtual reality (VR) technology has been used for training in various aspects of construction, the evidence of its effectiveness in construction quality training has yet to be examined. The current study develops a novel high-fidelity VR-based defect identification training module using minute details of construction defects to assess participants’ learning experience for construction quality-related training vis-à-vis conventional classroom training. Actual quality-related defect data from two construction projects was classified, and selected defects were modeled to create three-dimensional (3D) objects in an interactive VR environment. A robust sample of 121 Indian civil engineering students were recruited and categorized into three cohorts: No Training, Classroom Training, and VR Training. The data from these participants—data from questionnaires on perceptions and conceptual knowledge and scores in an innovative VR-based defect identification testing module—were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. In a context with no previous empirical examination of VR-based education in construction quality, this study reveals that high-fidelity VR training improves participants’ conceptual knowledge of construction defects. However, VR does not show a specific advantage compared to classroom training for conceptual knowledge retention, a finding that is attributable to the similarity in training materials between VR and conventional methods. Based on a robust methodology in the current study, these results amplify a somewhat limited perspective in the literature on the effectiveness of VR-based training and cautions against the potential overestimation of the effectiveness of VR for improvements in conceptual knowledge among study participants. The most significant contributions of this study lie in advancing the VR training literature, of which only a handful of studies have focused on assessing the practical knowledge gained by training recipients. Notably, this study reveals a 32.8% improvement in VR-based practical learning outcomes for the VR cohort compared to the no-training cohort, suggesting that VR could provide hands-on skills for navigating quality-related challenges in the construction industry.",Journal of Construction Engineering and Management; New York,United States,Oct 2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1061/JCEMD4.COENG-15493,"ProQuest One Applied & Life Sciences,SciTech Premium Collection",Journal Article,other,other,"The evidence of VR's effectiveness in construction quality training has yet to be examined, with a gap in empirical assessment of practical knowledge gained from such training.","Developed a high-fidelity VR-based defect identification training module using actual defect data.

Existing educational systems often fail to accommodate users relying on gestures, lack seamless integration across learning modalities, and provide limited adaptability to individual learning preferences. GEALP introduces a three-tier architecture combining 3D-CNN-based gesture recognition with attention-augmented temporal processing, bi-directional multi-modal content conversion, and dynamic learning adaptation supported by real-time feedback loops. Experiments with 1,000 users, 5,000 learning sessions, and 10,000 gestures demonstrate GEALP's superior performance. Results show improved gesture recognition accuracy (95.5%), user interaction (92.8%), and learning effectiveness (89.2%) compared to existing systems. The system also achieves 13.2% higher processing efficiency compared than benchmark systems such as MALS (8.1%) and PELS IRT (6.0%). The system presents an innovative bi-directional conversion framework enables seamlessly transformation across textual, auditory, visual, and gestural modalities while leveraging temporal attention mechanisms for low-latency gesture interpretation (average response time of 150 ms). Platform accessibility scores (9.2/10), personalization accuracy (94.2%), and knowledge retention rates (87.5%) further confirm the robustness of GEALP, indicating its potential for shaping future personalized learning environments.

54,A Gamified Cardiometabolic Health Curriculum Utilizing a Student Response System for Internal Medicine Residents,"Ji-Cheng, Hsieh1; Bagha Zohaib1; Weintraub, Spencer2; Jnani Jack1; Block, Lauren11 Internal Medicine, Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, USA2 Northwell Cardiovascular Institute, Northwell Health, New Hyde Park, USA","Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is frequently addressed in primary care, and professional association guidelines dictating the standard of care frequently change. Teaching clinical practice guidelines to residents remains important to promote knowledge retention and subsequent implementation in patient care. Gamification utilizes social elements and technology to promote accessible and active learning that enhances learner confidence, engagement, and knowledge. Data assessing gamification in teaching guideline-based care remains limited. We evaluated a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum utilizing a student response system (SRS) to assess the benefits of gamification in teaching guidelines to internal medicine residents.  Methods: We developed a gamified cardiometabolic health curriculum for categorical residents in internal medicine utilizing KAHOOT!® (Oslo, Norway). KAHOOT!® is an SRS where learners utilize their mobile devices to answer questions. Speed and accuracy contributed to placement on a digital leaderboard. Our curriculum consisted of one academic half-day with five 45-minute virtual didactics reviewing guideline-based management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic-associated fatty liver dysfunction (MAFLD), and weight management. KAHOOT!® was selected to promote ease of participation. The gamified format was compared to a traditional slide-based format. Residents are randomly assigned one of five clinic groups. Three groups received the gamified format, and two received the traditional format, without crossover. Residents were invited to complete anonymous pre- and post-surveys, which collected quantitative data such as Likert scale ratings of confidence and satisfaction with learning and test performance. Results: All residents (108 of 108) received the curriculum. Around 59% (64) received the gamified format, and 44 (41%) received the traditional format. Pre-post surveys were compared via a matched analysis. Anonymous surveys were matched via a code provided by each resident, and residents who completed only one of the two surveys were excluded. Likert scale ratings of confidence in management increased for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, MAFLD, and weight management, but not for T2DM, likely as T2DM had the lowest number of matched resident pairs analyzed. Comparing gamified and traditional formats, there was no difference in the post-curricular change in absolute score on board-style questions or increase in Likert scale ratings of confidence. A majority of residents (90.9%) who received the gamified format found it engaging, while a minority (14.2%) of residents who received the traditional format found it engaging. Analysis was limited by a low response rate of 21.6%. Anonymous pre-post surveys limited the assessment of non-response bias and whether respondent characteristics differed from those of non-respondents. Discussion: A gamified format was similar to a traditional format in increasing resident confidence in managing cardiometabolic health conditions and knowledge of guidelines. A gamified format was felt to be more engaging. Although the low response rate limits generalizability, we present initial data supporting the efficacy of a virtual gamified curriculum utilizing an SRS to teach clinical practice guidelines.

This need is further underscored by the fact that non-obstetricians and non-midwives often serve as first responders in out-of-hospital and acute care settings where vaginal birth (VB) is imminent. Traditional mannequin-based simulations depend on in-person tutors with demands on time and physical space. In the absence of realistic clinical scenarios, they serve no better than low-fidelity task trainers. Capitalising on recent advancements in affordable virtual reality (VR) head-mounted display (HMD) technology, we developed and iteratively refined a VR-based childbirth training system between 2020 and 2025. Initial user studies demonstrated strong knowledge retention although participants expressed a preference for in-person mannequin-based simulations due to the lack of tactile feedback in VR. To address this limitation, we introduced a mixed reality (MR)-enhanced childbirth training system in 2024. This innovative approach integrates high-precision alignment of virtual elements with physical mannequins and introduces a tactile component to enhance skill acquisition. A pilot study involving 35 Year 4 undergraduate students yielded positive feedback with participants praising the system’s heightened realism and opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction. While both VR and MR have distinct advan-tages and limitations, the affordability and versatility of modern HMD make VR/MR-based training modules highly scalable and adaptable to diverse scenarios, surpassing the single-task limitations of traditional mannequins.

Despite its inclusion in many school curricula, there is no consensus on the most effective teaching methodologies. This systematic review aims to compare instructional strategies used in first aid training during Physical Education and evaluate their impact on students’ knowledge, practical skills, and confidence. Methods : A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Six databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, ERIC, DIALNET, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) were searched up to December 2024. Eligible studies were quasi-experimental or observational, involved students aged 11–18, and focused on first aid instruction within Physical Education.

This study investigated how educator-learner homophily influences small-scale farmers' willingness to adopt agricultural technologies. Using a multi-case study approach, focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted with 60 small-scale farmers in Guatemala and the Dominican Republic who received agricultural training from U.S. volunteers. Farmers' perceptions of learning and educator credibility were analyzed. Guided by the Moscarelli Model (2023), which theorizes that perceived educator credibility comprises subject matter expertise and trustworthiness-moderated by educator-learner homophily-findings revealed an unexpected dynamic. Farmers rated U.S. volunteers as more credible and reliable than local extension agents, despite lower sociodemographic homophily between the farmers and U.S. volunteers. These findings challenge traditional assumptions about the role of homophily in international extension systems. By illuminating how educator-learner homophily influences knowledge transfer and behavior change, this study offers insights for designing more effective extension programs.

73,The Role of Dashboards in Augmented-Reality-Based Language Learning: Enhancing Language Learning and Metacognitive Awareness,"Geng Xuewang1    ; Yamada Masanori11 Data-Driven Innovation Initiative, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan","The development of information and communication technologies has created limitless prospects for using augmented reality (AR) in various fields. Unfortunately, the multitasking nature of AR systems prevents learners from successfully reflecting and retaining knowledge. This study developed and designed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components: personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process, to promote knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness among AR learners. A total of 31 intermediate-level Japanese learners participated in an experiment involving pre-tests, post-tests, and a delayed test to assess the LAD. Learners engaged with the AR learning system for Japanese compound verb learning and utilized the LAD to monitor and reflect on their AR learning activities. Behavioral data were analyzed using Lag Sequential Analysis (LSA), while learning performance was evaluated through one-way repeated-measures ANOVA tests. The findings indicate that the use of the LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition. Additionally, there were different usage patterns of the dashboard among learners, which corresponded to significant differences in their learning outcomes and changes in metacognitive awareness. Learners who primarily focused on the learning process and social comparison components of the dashboard demonstrated improved knowledge retention. Conversely, those who mainly concentrated on personal learning data experienced the most significant gains in metacognitive awareness. This study also provides crucial design insights on the integration of dashboard components with cognitive efforts to maximize learning outcomes. Alternate abstract: Plain language summary Improving Language Learning Through a Dashboard: A Study on Japanese Learners Using Augmented Reality This study examined the effectiveness of a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) with three components (personal learning data, social comparison, and visualization of the learning process) in promoting the knowledge acquisition and metacognitive awareness of 31 non-native learners of Japanese in learning Japanese compound verbs. The results indicated that the use of LAD significantly improves learning outcomes and metacognitive processes, such as knowledge of cognition and regulation of cognition, and second, that students who concentrated on the learning process and social comparison showed the most improved performance in knowledge retention, while those who concentrated on personal learning data showed greater improvements in metacognitive awareness. This study contributes significantly to the field of LA by providing evidence that the integration of LAD into AR learning environments can meet the multifaceted challenges posed by concurrent multitasking, thus facilitating a more monitored and reflective learning experience.

Traditional pedagogical approaches, such as cadaveric dissection, anatomical models, and textbook-based learning, have been the cornerstone of medical education for decades. However, these methods face challenges, including limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems). Recent advancements in immersive technologies, particularly virtual reality (VR), present a transformative opportunity to enhance anatomy education by offering interactive, scalable, and engaging learning experiences. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of VR simulation in improving medical students' learning outcomes in anatomy education, comparing its effectiveness to conventional teaching methodologies. This systematic review was conducted in strict accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. A comprehensive literature search was performed across six major medical databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, encompassing studies published between January 2019 and February 2024. The search strategy employed a combination of MeSH terms and keywords related to ""virtual reality"", ""anatomy education"", and ""medical students"". Study selection was guided by the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study (PICOS) framework, with inclusion criteria focusing on randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and comparative analyses evaluating VR-based anatomy instruction for medical students. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess study quality and potential bias. Due to significant heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted to integrate findings thematically rather than through meta-analysis. The review included 14 studies with a total of 961 participants, predominantly medical students across various training stages. Among the included studies, 71% demonstrated statistically significant improvements in anatomy learning outcomes with VR compared to traditional methods, including enhanced spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and learner engagement; 21% of the studies reported no significant difference in learning efficacy between VR and conventional approaches, while only 7% found VR simulation only partially effective, citing technical limitations and a steep learning curve as barriers. Subgroup analyses suggested that VR was particularly beneficial for visualizing complex anatomical regions (e.g., neuroanatomy, musculoskeletal structures) and for students with limited prior exposure to cadaveric dissection. However, variability in VR platform design, assessment tools and instructional integration underscored the need for standardized implementation frameworks. The review generally indicated the benefits of VR simulation in anatomy education, but larger studies are needed to fully explore its potential in medical anatomy training. Future studies should rigorously evaluate VR implementation in anatomy education to provide more comprehensive evidence of its strengths and weaknesses for medical teaching.",Cureus; Palo Alto,Netherlands,2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.81893,"Publicly Available Content Database,ProQuest One Health & Nursing",Journal Article,other,other,"Limited accessibility (e.g., resource-intensive setups), ethical concerns (e.g., participant privacy), and difficulties in visualizing complex three-dimensional structures (e.g., dynamic systems) in traditional anatomy education methods.",Systematic review conducted in accordance with PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines.

This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention. Other implications for immersive learning theory are discussed, and practical solutions for incorporating narrative immersion in learning are also suggested.",Educational Psychology Review; New York,Netherlands,2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-025-09984-4,"Education Research Index,ProQuest One Psychology",Journal Article,other,other,"Immersive learning is predominantly constrained to technology-based interventions, limiting its diverse applications.","Experimental design with random assignment of 228 participants to one of three media forms (image, word list, narrative) containing identical items; immediate and delayed free recall memory tests; measurement of immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery; ANOVA and correlation analyses.",[],[],"Narrative media was significantly more immersive and evoked higher levels of mental imagery than list or image media; less decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for narrative group compared to list and image groups; immersive narratives facilitate spontaneous mental image generation, leading to improved knowledge retention.",[],[]

This study reports on an experiment investigating the learning affordances of psychological immersion evoked by narrative absorption. A total of 228 participants were randomly assigned to one of three forms of media, an image, a word list, and a narrative, all of which contained identical items to be memorized for immediate and delayed free recall memory tests. Other variables measured were immersion, extraneous cognitive load, and mental imagery. ANOVA and correlation analyses showed that the narrative media was found to be significantly more immersive and that it evoked mental imagery in individuals at higher levels than both the list and image media. Importantly, there was more decay in memory recall between immediate and delayed tests for those exposed to the list and the image than for those who read the narrative. This implies the utility of immersive narratives for spontaneous mental image generation, which leads to improved knowledge retention.

101,Virtual Reality Training Programs in Disaster Preparedness: A Systematic Review,"Kaggwa, Mark Mohan; Chaimowitz, Gary A; Agboinghale, Precious; Marginean, Diana; Olagunju, Andrew T","Background: The demand for effective disaster preparedness training in hospitals is steadily increasing, as healthcare staff need to handle emergencies efficiently while providing patient care. However, conventional training methods like live drills and tabletop exercises can require significant resources, limit participation, and disrupt hospital operations. In light of these challenges, Virtual Reality (VR) training has emerged as a modern solution, offering an innovative way to improve training efficiency without interfering with routine hospital activities. This study, therefore, examines how VR training compares to traditional methods in preparing hospital personnel for disasters, focusing specifically on effectiveness and cost. Methods: We reviewed studies concerning the effectiveness and economic assessments of VR compared to traditional methods. To answer the research questions, we followed the Canada Drug Agency's guides on conducting a health technology assessment. Articles were identified from both peer-reviewed and gray literature. Results: The review highlights eight pertinent studies demonstrating VR's advantages, including boosting knowledge retention, performance, and overall confidence among healthcare professionals in disaster preparedness. Furthermore, the economic analysis indicates that although the initial costs of VR synchronous training may be higher, the long-term savings from reduced ongoing training and maintenance can lead to greater cost efficiency. In addition, while VR training presents safety benefits, challenges such as cybersickness and accessibility concerns have also been observed. Conclusion: VR training offers considerable advantages over traditional disaster preparedness methods and significantly improves healthcare workers' confidence and skills. Despite the high upfront costs, the potential long-term financial benefits appear promising. To maximize results, funding for VR initiatives must emphasize demonstrated effectiveness alongside ongoing research to explore broader applications and address the challenges posed by these emerging technologies.",Discover Education,other,2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1007/s44217-025-00771-5,Ed ucation Research Index,"Report, Article",other,other,"Conventional disaster preparedness training methods in hospitals (e.g., live drills, tabletop exercises) require significant resources, limit participation, and disrupt hospital operations.","Literature review following health technology assessment guidelines, analyzing studies from peer-reviewed and gray literature on effectiveness and economic assessments.",['Deliberate Practice and Repetition'],['Virtual Reality'],"VR training boosts knowledge retention, performance, and confidence in disaster preparedness among healthcare professionals.

107,Problem-Based Learning and Case-Based Learning in Clinical Practical Teaching for Gynecology Residents: A Narrative Review,"Zhu, Y; Zhang, J; Fei, J; Fang, H; Zhang, Z","Background: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010–January 2025) using keywords: “problem-based learning”, “case-based learning”, “gynecology education”, “residency training”. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Results: Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice. Conclusion: PBL and CBL are transformative pedagogical strategies for gynecology residency training, effectively developing competencies needed for complex clinical practice. Successful implementation requires rigorously designed cases, faculty trained in facilitative guidance, and strategic technology integration. These approaches prepare residents not only as skilled technicians but as adaptable, patient-centered practitioners capable of navigating evolving healthcare challenges.

121,Evaluating the Benefits and Drawbacks of Visualizing Systems Modeling Lan guage (SysML) Diagrams in the 3D Virtual Reality Environment,"Mostafa, Lutfi    ; Valerdi Ricardo","Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) prioritizes system design through models rather than documents, and it is implemented with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), which is the state-of-the-art language in academia and industry. Virtual Reality (VR), an immersive visualization technology, can simulate reality in virtual environments with varying degrees of fidelity. In recent years, the technology industry has invested substantially in the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and related virtual reality (VR) technologies. Various research has suggested that VR-based immersive design reviews enhance system issue/fault identification, collaboration, focus, and presence compared to non-immersive approaches. Additionally, several research efforts have demonstrated that the VR environment provides higher understanding and knowledge retention levels than traditional approaches. In recent years, multiple attempts have been made to visualize conventional 2D SysML diagrams in a virtual reality environment. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no empirical evaluation has been performed to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of visualizing SysML diagrams in a VR environment. Hence, the authors aimed to evaluate four key benefit types and drawbacks through experiments with human subjects. The authors chose four benefit types—Systems Understanding, Information Sharing, Modeling and Training Experience, and Digital Twin based on the MBSE value and benefits review performed by researchers and benefits claimed by the evaluations for similar visual formalism languages. Experiments were conducted to compare the understanding, interaction, and knowledge retention for 3D VR and conventional 2D SysML diagrams. The authors chose a ground-based telescope system as the system of interest (SOI) for system modeling. The authors utilized a standalone wireless HMD unit for a virtual reality experience, which enabled experiments to be conducted irrespective of location. Students and experts from multiple disciplines, including systems engineering, participated in the experiment and provided their opinions on the VR SysML implementation. The knowledge test, perceived evaluation results, and post-completion surveys were analyzed to determine whether the 3D VR SysML implementation improved these benefits and identified potential drawbacks.

125,Fluoride in Cultural and Literary Narratives: AI as a Tool for Enhancing Knowledge on Educational Platforms,"Yang, Liuxiuzi11 Jinan University School of Humanities; Guangdong Zhuhai; 519070, CHINA","Purpose: With an emphasis on the function of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated instructional content, the current study attempts to investigate the impact of fluoride-related cultural and literary tales on information retention. The study investigates the links between exposure to fluoride narratives, learners' attitudes about fluoride narratives, engagement with AI-based platforms, and perceived utility of AI-generated information by utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Additionally, the study looks at how AI involvement and attitudes affect knowledge retention through serial and mediating effects. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey approach with students in China's Jiangxi and Henan provinces as its target population. The relationship between exposure to fluoride narratives in educational materials, perceptions of the value of AI-generated information, interaction with AI platforms, and knowledge retention was examined through the application of structural equation modeling, or SEM. The pathways in the Technology Acceptance Model were examined using cross-sectional and serial mediation analyses. Of particular interest was the effect of AI-driven educational material on attitudes and engagement that lead to knowledge retention. Results: The results show that learners' views regarding fluoride and their engagement with AI platforms are greatly impacted when they are exposed to fluoride narratives in instructional content. These elements also highly predict the memory of fluoride-related knowledge. The study shows that the association between knowledge retention and the perceived utility of AI-generated information is entirely mediated by positive sentiments regarding the narratives and involvement with AI-based learning platforms. The impact of AI-generated material on knowledge retention is contingent upon learners' attitudes and their degree of involvement with AI platforms, as demonstrated by serial mediation studies. Research Limitation/Implication: Since the cross-sectional methodology makes it difficult to determine causal linkages, further longitudinal research is required to fully comprehend the long-term impacts of AI-enhanced instructional content on knowledge retention. To improve the study's validity, more objective measures of engagement and information retention should be included in subsequent studies. Orginality: This work presents a unique use of TAM in the context of educational technology, focusing on how AI-generated material might support learning experiences that are narrative-driven and culturally rich.

132,The Impact of AI-Generated Instructional Videos on Problem-Based Learning in Science Teacher Education,"Pellas, Nikolaos","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained significant prominence in science education, yet its practical applications, particularly in teacher training, remain underexplored. Specifically, there is a lack of research on AI’s potential to support personalized professional development through automated analysis of classroom interactions and tailored feedback. As science teacher education requires skill development in complex scientific concepts within problem-based learning (PBL) contexts, there is a growing need for innovative, technology-driven instructional tools. AI-generated instructional videos are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for enhancing educational experiences. This study investigates the impact of AI-generated instructional videos, designed using established instructional design principles, on self-efficacy, task performance, and learning outcomes in science teacher education. Employing a within-subjects design, the current study included pre-test, post-test, and transfer assessments to evaluate learning durability and transferability, consistent with design-based research methodology. Moreover, this study compares the effectiveness of two AI-generated instructional video formats: one with an embedded preview feature allowing learners to preview key concepts before detailed instruction (video-with-preview condition) and another without this feature (video-without-preview condition). It specifically examines the role of preview features in enhancing these outcomes during training on scientific concepts with 55 Greek pre-service science teachers (n = 55; mean age 27.3 years; range 22–35). The results demonstrated that the videos effectively supported self-efficacy, task performance, and knowledge retention. However, no significant differences were observed between videos with and without preview features across all assessed metrics and tests. These findings also indicate that AI-generated instructional videos can effectively enhance knowledge retention, transfer, and self-efficacy, positioning them as promising assets in science teacher education. The limited impact of the preview feature highlights the need for careful design and evaluation of instructional elements, such as interactivity and adaptive learning algorithms, to fully realize their potential.",Education Sciences; Basel,Switzerland,2025,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci15010102,Publicly Available Content Database,Journal Article,other,other,"Lack of research on AI's potential to support personalized professional development for teachers through automated analysis of classroom interactions and tailored feedback, particularly in science teacher education.","Within-subjects design with pre-test, post-test, and transfer assessments; design-based research methodology.",['Deliberate Practice and Repetition'],['AI'],"AI-generated instructional videos effectively supported self-efficacy, task performance, and knowledge retention.

Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention.

Objectives This study examined the effectiveness of desktop‐based virtual reality (VR) social platforms compared to video conferencing (VC) platforms in enhancing students' learning gains and experiences in online synchronous learning. Methods The study used a within‐subject design, involving 34 college students in two online lecture modules, one via a VR social platform and another through a VC platform. Knowledge assessments occurred pre‐ and post‐modules and after 1 week. Students also completed post‐module questionnaires to evaluate their learning experience, in terms of social presence, easiness of use and perceived emotions. In‐depth interviews provided further insights into their experiences with both platforms. Results The study showed that using VR social platforms for online synchronous learning enhanced immediate knowledge, especially in students less interested in the content, yet it did not notably impact long‐term knowledge retention. Despite no significant findings in social presence from questionnaires, interviews indicated that the VR's heightened interactivity might be offset by the effect of not seeing others' real appearances in promoting social presence. Furthermore, the VC platform was found to be easier to use, attributed to its familiarity and user‐friendliness. Finally, students experienced increased fun, awe and interest, along with reduced boredom, when using the VR social platform. Conclusion The findings highlight the potential of VR to enrich online learning while underscoring the need for effective strategies facilitating a smooth integration into educational settings.

Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A ( n  = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B ( n  = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C ( n  = 32) observed physical models, and Group D ( n  = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students’ performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students’ immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation.

Online learning, an emerging educational paradigm, has garnered considerable attention for its accessibility and convenience. Although online education platforms offer learners a high degree of freedom, they lack personalized guidance, leading to challenges such as ""Information Overload"" and ""Knowledge Loss"". These challenges primarily manifest as learners struggling to identify resources that match their preferences and needs, adversely affecting their learning efficiency and outcomes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an exercise recommendation algorithm that combines the emerging fields of reinforcement learning and recommendation systems to help learners find suitable exercise resources. Initially, we use a knowledge tracking model to assess the potential knowledge level of learners. Following this, the Deep Q Network algorithm is utilized to modify learners' exercise records by removing unsatisfactory exercises that learners may have mistakenly selected during the learning process. Based on the modified record of exercises and the knowledge levels of learners, the algorithm recommends appropriate exercises.

Traditional methods have been augmented by advanced simulation technologies, which enhance knowledge and skills in clinical settings. However, limitations such as high costs and space constraints persist. Clinical virtual simulation, an emerging approach, offers an interactive and immersive alternative that may address these challenges, but its impact on student satisfaction, self-efficacy, and knowledge retention remains unclear. Methods: This randomized controlled trial involved second-year nursing students (N=42) enrolled in a course on physiological responses. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group using clinical virtual simulation or a control group using low-fidelity simulation. Assessments were conducted at three time points: pretest (A0), immediately post-intervention (A1), and two months later (A2). Knowledge retention, satisfaction, and self-efficacy were measured using tailored instruments. Data analysis included t-tests, MANOVA, and Cohen’s d for effect size. Results: Significant differences were found between the groups in knowledge retention and learning satisfaction. The experimental group showed superior outcomes in both immediate and long-term knowledge retention (P = .001, P = .02) and higher satisfaction levels (P < .001). MANOVA indicated significant time-related changes influenced by group allocation. No significant differences were observed in self-efficacy between groups (P = .9), although group differences were noted across assessments (P = .003).

Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students' favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated.

165,Spatial Ability Predicts Short-Term Retention of Declarative Technical Information in Authentic Engineering Educational Settings: An Original Study with Two Conceptual Replications,"Hyland, Tomás    ; Seery, Niall    ; Buckley, Jeffrey","An association between spatial ability, particularly visualisation, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades. Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.",European Journal of Engineering Education,other,2024,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2024.2405860,Education Research Index,"Report, Article",other,other,"Need to better understand the relationship between spatial ability and STEM education from a cognitive perspective, specifically its role in knowledge retention.","Original investigation in an authentic educational setting, followed by two conceptual replication studies.",[],[],Visualisation ability and interest in lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention for declarative technical information in engineering.

166,Comparative Effects of Dynamic Geometry System and Physical Manipulatives on Inquiry-Based Math Learning for Students in Junior High School,"Guan, Hao; Li, Jing; Rao, Yongsheng    ; Chen, Ruxian; Xu, Zhangtao","Mathematical inquiry involving hands-on activities has received increasing attention in mathematics education. Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A (n = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B (n = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C (n = 32) observed physical models, and Group D (n = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students' performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students' immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation. In summary, as compared to the physical manipulatives, DGS, particularly when employed with constructive strategy, has shown to encourage students to more actively engage in task-related cognitive behaviors, thereby supporting and enhancing inquiry-based math learning of students in junior high school.",Education and Information Technologies,other,2024,Scholarly Journal,English,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-12663-6,Education Research Index,"Report, Article",other,other,"Effects of Dynamic Geometry System (DGS) and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question, specifically regarding immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest.","Quasi-experimental research design; pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model; adapted interest questionnaire; data analyzed using ANCOVA and t-test.",['Deliberate Practice and Repetition'],[],"In construction contexts, DGS users showed superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention vs. physical manipulatives.

173,Adoption and Usage of Augmented Reality-Based Virtual Laboratories Tool for Engineering Studies,"Kulkarni, Radhika; Harne, Rajat","Aim/Purpose: The study seeks to utilize Augmented Reality (AR) in creating virtual laboratories for engineering education, focusing on enhancing teaching methodologies to facilitate student understanding of intricate and theoretical engineering principles while also assessing engineering students' acceptance of such laboratories. Background: AR, a part of next-generation technology, has enhanced the perception of reality by overlaying virtual elements in the physical environment. The utilization of AR is prevalent across different disciplines, yet its efficacy in facilitating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is limited. Engineering studies, a part of STEM learning, involves complex and abstract concepts like machine simulation, structural analysis, and design optimization; these things would be easy to grasp with the help of AR. This restriction can be attributed to their innovative characteristics and disparities. Therefore, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the acceptance of these technologies by students -- the primary target demographic -- and examining the impact of these factors is essential to maximize the advantages of AR while refining the implementation processes. Methodology: The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a tool that enriches the educational experience within engineering laboratories. Utilizing Unity game engine libraries, digital content is meticulously crafted for this tool and subsequently integrated with geo-location functionalities. The tool's user-friendly interface allows both faculty and non-faculty members of the academic institution to establish effortlessly the virtual laboratory. Subsequently, an assessment of the tool is conducted through the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, involving the administration of surveys to university students to gauge their level of adaptability. Contribution: The utilization of interactive augmented learning in laboratory settings enables educational establishments to realize notable savings in time and resources, thereby achieving sustainable educational outcomes. The study is of great importance due to its utilization of student behavioral intentions as the underlying framework for developing an AR tool and illustrating the impact of learner experience on various objectives and the acceptance of AR in Engineering studies. Furthermore, the research results enable educational institutions to implement AR-based virtual laboratories to improve student experiences strategically, align with learner objectives, and ultimately boost the adaptability of AR technologies. Findings: Drawing on practice-based research, the authors showcase work samples and a digital project of AR-based Virtual labs to illustrate the evaluation of the adaptability of AR technology. Adaptability is calculated by conducting a survey of 300 undergraduate university students from different engineering departments and applying an adaptability method to determine the behavioral intentions of students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Engineering institutions could leverage research findings in the implementation of AR to enhance the effectiveness of AR technology in practical education settings. Recommendation for Researchers: The authors implement a pragmatic research framework aimed at integrating AR technology into virtual AR-based labs for engineering education. This study delves into a unique perspective within the realm of engineering studies, considering students' perspectives and discerning their behavioral intentions by drawing upon previous research on technology utilization. The research employs various objectives and learner experiences to assess their influence on students' acceptance of AR technology. Impact on Society: The use of AR in engineering institutions, especially in laboratory practicals, has a significant impact on society, supported by the UTAUT2 model. UTAUT2 model assesses factors like performance, effort expectancy, social influence, and conditions, showing that AR in education is feasible and adaptable. This adaptability helps students and educators incorporate AR tools effectively for better educational results. AR-based labs allow students to interact with complex engineering concepts in immersive settings, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention.

Traditional teaching, which relies on theoretical classes and manuals, does not provide sufficient interactive or practical experience, hindering the comprehension and retention of knowledge. Understanding hardware is fundamental for computer science and related fields students, as it is the basis for building and maintaining computer systems. The lack of practical knowledge in this area can result in inadequate training, limiting students’ abilities to apply theoretical concepts in real-world situations, which can affect their academic performance and job market readiness. There have been initiatives that included the use of printed manuals, video tutorials, and software simulations to teach hardware. However, these methods failed to engage students sufficiently or provide a practical and realistic learning experience. These methods can become boring and disconnected from the practical experience necessary for properly assembling computer hardware. The proposed solution is the use of an augmented reality (AR) mobile application to create an interactive and practical learning experience. The application called Build_PC was designed, and it allows students to visualize and manipulate hardware components in a virtual environment superimposed on the real world, allowing practical learning of computer assembly and operation. The main results of the research, which used volunteer students associated with control and experimental groups, show that the use of Build_PC significantly improved the understanding and retention of knowledge about computer hardware. Students who used the application demonstrated a greater ability to understand the operation of hardware components compared to those who used traditional methods. In addition, students reported greater motivation and satisfaction with the learning process. Implementing a AR-powered application in hardware education has several important implications. Firstly, it provides an effective tool to enhance understanding and knowledge retention, which can lead to better academic and professional preparation for students.

188,Organizational Resilience to Knowledge Loss in Biotechnology Research,"Jain, Amit1    1 Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, College of Engineering and Design, Singapore","In this article, we examine organizational resilience to research and development (R&D) productivity losses following knowledge loss (aka “forgetting”) using a long panel (1970–2007) of data on U.S. biotechnology research. In our model, knowledge and R&D productivity loss may occur through three mechanisms, scientist turnover, interference with knowledge retrieval, and scientist knowledge decay. Our model also proposes three means through which organizations may become resilient to the effects of knowledge loss on R&D productivity. First, managers may compensate for knowledge losses due to turnover by recruitment. Second, the effects of interference to knowledge retrieval due to the use of new technologies may be minimized if new technologies are introduced into organizations by members with little prior experience in using incumbent technologies or by scientists with little prior collaboration experience. Third, scientists may mitigate the effects of knowledge decay by relearning because the reacquisition of previously lost knowledge is easier than learning it was initially.

Objectives: The article examined the strategies put in place by SMEs for tacit knowledge management (TKM) practices and to develop a framework that will promote TKM for SMEs. Method: The study adopted a quantitative research method and targeted 326 SMEs using Google Forms. One hundred and eighty (180; 55.2%) useful responses were obtained and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Results: Most of the SME owners are aware and affirmed that there is a particular tacit knowledge that is of importance to business. The most common methods of capturing tacit knowledge among SMEs are monitoring, practical sessions, in-house training programmes, and brainstorming. Tacit knowledge is shared during meetings (such as project teams) and when dialoguing. The study also revealed that electronic files in computers are the major tools for storing the collected tacit knowledge. Conclusion: The study concluded that TKM among SMEs in KZN required improvement and recommended improving teams and informal networks and making information and communication technology tools available to preserve tacit knowledge.

In 47 articles, the 3DPAM was designed from CT scans. Five printing processes were listed. Plastic and its derivatives were used in 48 studies. The cost per design ranged from 1.25 USD to 2800 USD. Thirty-seven studies compared 3DPAM to a reference model. Thirty-three articles investigated educational performance. The main advantages were visual and haptic qualities, effectiveness for teaching, reproducibility, customizability and manipulability, time savings, integration of functional anatomy, better mental rotation ability, knowledge retention, and educator/student satisfaction. The main disadvantages were related to the design: consistency, lack of detail or transparency, overly bright colours, long printing time, and high cost.

More realistic models require access to more expensive 3D printing technologies and substantially longer design time, which would greatly increase the overall cost. Choosing an appropriate image acquisition modality is key. From a pedagogical viewpoint, 3DPAMs are effective tools for teaching anatomy, positively impacting the learning outcomes and satisfaction level. The pedagogical effectiveness of 3DPAMs seems to be best when they reproduce complex anatomical areas, and they are used by students early in their medical studies.

Design/methodology/approach It applies the knowledge-based view of the firm to the notion of the Great Resignation, reviews the extant literature and relies on secondary data. Findings The Great Resignation has created numerous knowledge-related impacts on the individual, organizational and national levels. On the individual level, because of an accelerating adoption of freelancing, the future may witness an expansion of the category of the knowledge worker and a growing need for personal knowledge management methods and information technologies. Organizational effects include knowledge loss, reduced business process efficiency, damaged intra-organizational knowledge flows, lower relational capital, lost informal friendship networks, difficulty attracting the best human capital, undermined knowledge transfer processes and knowledge leakage to competition. Countries may also witness the depletion of national human capital. Practical implications Managers should learn how to use the available human capital more efficiently; realize the importance of universal succession planning programs; automate knowledge-centric business processes; facilitate knowledge-based IT initiatives by implementing self-functioning virtual communities, including enterprise social networks; restructure organizations to optimize intra-organizational knowledge flows; adjust strategies, products and target markets based on the available human capital; and create telecommuting conditions for people with disabilities who cannot be physically present.

Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build ‘fluency’ in the targeted skills.

This study focuses on evaluation of two instructional modes: direct interaction and manipulation of the VR learning environment; and the vicarious approach of observing how a novice peer and an expert learn with VR. An experimental design was utilized with two comparison conditions: direct VR interaction (n = 72) and the vicarious approach (n = 69). Participants' knowledge and emotional engagement were evaluated via self-report questionnaires. Results showed that though learning with the direct VR condition was associated with more intense emotional engagement, there was no significant difference in knowledge gains between the two study conditions. The findings suggest that each of the two instructional modes has specific instructional affordances and that the cognitive and emotional components of learning via VR should be further explored. Since learning vicariously through observing the dialogue between an expert and a peer can have immediate knowledge gains comparable to the direct VR interaction, there is an effective and more accessible opportunity for VR-based learning.

The Institute for Management Development (IMD) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design collaborate on SCI every year (SUTD). The report evaluates how locals view the buildings and technological applications that are available in their towns. Although the study offers a thorough examination of the cities for evaluation, the city clusters should be more sensitive and not be created using strict clustering techniques. In order to address this problem, the clustering algorithms namely K-Medoids, Fuzzy C-Means, and K-Means, which outperform hard clustering approaches in terms of robustness to vagueness and knowledge retention, are used.

220,Learning Critical Thinking Skills Online: Can Precision Teaching Help?,"Tan, Angel J. Y.; Davies, Jean L.; Nicolson, Roderick I.; Karaminis, Themis","Critical thinking is identified as a key educational outcome in higher education curricula; however, it is not trivial to support students in building this multifaceted skill. In this study, we evaluated a brief online learning intervention focusing on informal fallacy identification, a hallmark critical-thinking skill. The intervention used a bite-sized video learning approach, which has been shown to promote student engagement. Video-based learning was implemented within a precision teaching (PT) framework, which modulates the exposure of individual learners to the learning material to enable them to build 'fluency' in the targeted skills. In one of the learning conditions, PT was applied synergistically with domain-general problem-based training to support generalisation. The intervention consisted of two learning episodes and was administered to three groups (learning conditions) of 19 participants each: a PT fluency-based training group; a PT + group, where PT was combined with problem-based training; and a self-directed learning control group. All three groups showed comparable improvements in fallacy identification on taught (post-episode tests) and unseen materials (post-intervention assessment), with lower-scoring participants showing higher gains than high-scoring participants. The results of the knowledge retention tests a week later were also comparable between groups. Importantly, in the domain-general fallacy-identification assessment (post-intervention), the two PT groups showed higher improvements than the control group. These findings suggest that the integration of bite-sized video learning technologies with PT can improve students' critical-thinking skills.

Sixty-seven first-year undergraduate health science and medical students were randomized into two groups to complete a lesson on the physiology, anatomy, pathology, and pharmacology of asthma, delivered through either a textbook-style (n = 34) or MR (n = 33) resource. Participants took part in the study in small groups and completed the intervention and surveys in separate areas of a large laboratory space. A pre-test prior to the lesson included multiple-choice questions, with the post-test having additional multiple-choice questions to assess learning. A follow-up test to assess retention was performed two weeks later. Pre- and post-test scores revealed increased learning across both the textbook (p = 0.001) and MR (p = 0.05) interventions, although higher test results were obtained by those using the textbook-style resource (p < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in knowledge retention scores. Although the textbook-style resource was more effective for increasing test results, participants perceived MR as more favorable, highlighting the experience as enjoyable and useful. This study presents MR as an option for integration in cases where educators wish to enhance student enjoyment of the learning experience.

The existing training model (a master teaching a limited number of apprentices over the course of several years) is unable to meet the level of healthcare professionals needed. Empirical evidence from other industries demonstrates virtual reality (VR) technology is an effective and efficient way of improving training. Methods VR technology allows users to interact with a computer-simulated environment. VR implementation in medicine focuses on the rapid acceleration of human learning in medical training. It aims to provide technology for medical staff to reskill and upskill more effectively, without a large time investment. The combination of cognitive training in an experience-based learning virtual environment enabled by advanced VR software and hardware provides several advantages: (1) unrestricted training time, increased training access during COVID-19 restrictions; (2) remote training access: growing demand for health professionals in countries with less developed infrastructure; (3) modernizing standards: during simulated training competency evaluations for residents are performed. Results (1) Increased trainee engagement and knowledge retention (70%) compared to videos (10%) or lecturing (5%) (2) Decreased training time, 29% less OR training time due to skill transfer from VR to OR (3) Decreased training costs.

This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students' prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise. However, in-person UAV instruction may not be accessible for all educators because of UAV cost or lack of instructor training. This study provides educators with crucial recommendations for designing UAV exercises to improve access to UAV-related educational content.

Socio-cultural and socio-political factors exacerbate language erosion and encourage supplantation by another more dominant language. Hence, we ask: what are the sociocognitive principles which make language death hurtful and symbolic? Within this article, we attempt to outline a sociocognitive account of language death, situating the Hallidayan perspective of language as a “social-semiotic” system alongside a Cognitive Linguistic approach. We further contextualise language as inseparable from culture, drawing insight from the sociological thought of Bourdieu. We contend that language death entails psychological trauma, representing the destruction of cultural genealogy and the loss of knowledge intrinsic to personal self-imagery and identity. To this end, we present a case study of the Māori languaculture in Aotearoa (New Zealand), tracing the impact of colonialism and marginalisation to current efforts and ambitions to ensure the languacultural survival of Māori and reclaim space in Aotearoa as a respected knowledge system and means of expression, particularly in the socio-technical age of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Web. We argue that our analysis bodes practical implications for language maintenance and revitalisation, concluding that sociolinguistic practitioners should consider a socio-cognitivist as well as socio-technical paradigm for language intervention.

The purpose of this study is to understand the antecedent factors that motivate older adults’ knowledge contribution and knowledge seeking (KS) behaviors in VCs. Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in socio-emotional selectivity and social cognitive theories, this study included five key variables and developed models for older adults’ knowledge contributing (KC)/KS behaviors. This paper tested the hypotheses using data from a sample of 204 older adults in 3 VCs in China. Findings: The results provide support for most of the hypotheses and show that while other members’ participation (MP) acts as a substitute for meaning in life and attitude toward aging, it acts as a complement for outcome expectations (OE) focused on others and OE focused on oneself in their impacts on KC/KS activities. Practical implications: The study provides practical insights for developing elder human resources via VCs to avoid knowledge loss. Originality/value: This study described older adults’ unique characteristics when modeling their information and communication technologies-related behaviors and built two models to explain their KC/KS behaviors. It confirmed that the same factor has different levels of impact on older adults’ KC/KS behaviors in VCs. In addition, it confirmed and reinforced the complementary and substitutive effects of other MP as an environmental factor on these behaviors.

This means there is a growing need to integrate UAV training into STEM education. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a UAV education module and laboratory exercise for natural resource science students. The study used a series of reusable learning objects (RLOs) to assess students' prior knowledge of remote sensing and UAVs. Students were taught the steps of UAV data acquisition and processing through lectures and UAV simulation videos. Students applied this knowledge by completing a laboratory exercise that used previously collected UAV data. Student knowledge retention and understanding were evaluated using an online quiz to determine the effectiveness of the education module. The average quiz score was 92%, indicating that the UAV laboratory exercise effectively taught students about UAV data acquisition and processing for natural resource research. Overall, students expressed positive opinions about the UAV education module. Student feedback indicated that the laboratory exercise was engaging, but some students would have preferred a hands-on experience for some parts of the exercise.

253,Green Software Process Factors: A Qualitative Study,"Siti Rohana Ahmad Ibrahim    ; Yahaya, Jamaiah    ; Hasimi Sallehudin","In the twenty-first century, the use of software is growing due to many applications requiring large and complex software. Many people do not realise that the use of software has influenced the operation of computer hardware to move indirectly as it affects the hardware’s energy consumption and carbon emissions. Previous studies focused more on models and tools to measure the impact of power consumption and energy efficiency from hardware than on software development studies. Energy consumption can be optimised by the greening software process throughout all phases of development activity. Besides, the current green software process models are more focused on environmental and economic elements and do not integrate with the waste elements in the development phase. Integrating sustainability and waste elements is essential to ensure that the development process complies with green process standards. A qualitative method is used through interviews involving eight informants from Malaysia’s public and private sectors. The objectives of the empirical study are to reveal the current practices of the green software process in industry, identify software process waste and determine green factors associated with the software process. The analysis is guided by a thematic approach using Atlas.ti 8 software.
