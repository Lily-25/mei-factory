Abstract: The Productive Failure (PF) technique is an educational strategy that uses collaborative problem-solving to facilitate resident physicians' understanding of new concepts. A novel implementation of this approach is PF simulation, in which they engage in simulation before receiving comprehensive teaching on the involved aspects. PF commences with the generation and consolidation phases, where resident physicians develop and analyze the advantages and constraints of various Representations and Solution Methods. These are followed by the knowledge assembly phases, respectively. Wherein physicians gain essential concepts by organizing their representations and thoughts in alignment with established responses. PF is deliberately designed to induce failure in problem-solving; however, in the following review, this process of failure can help resident physicians better acquire target ideas. The crucial aspect of PF design is that throughout the problem-solving phase, physicians receive no instructional support or scaffolding. Explicit failure-driven scaffolding is an alternative method for enhancing the efficacy of preparatory problem-solving. This narrative review examines the theoretical foundation of PF and its role in collaboration, clinical reasoning development, stress management, and knowledge retention among resident physicians. Using cognitive psychology, clinical reasoning theories, and reflective practice, we examined how PF helps people learn from failure, shift from traditional teaching to retain knowledge long-term, and develop flexible skills in complex clinical settings. Highlighting these components underscores the significance of practical simulations, varied information sources, and systematic feedback in cultivating these competencies. The role of PF in medical education policy suggests ways to integrate it into future training models to address current curriculum gaps. Future directions for PF in medical education include individualized learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and the integration of future technologies such as virtual reality (VR). PF constitutes a viable educational approach for augmenting the clinical and cognitive competencies of resident physicians, equipping them with the intricacies of contemporary medical practices.The Productive Failure (PF) technique is an educational strategy that uses collaborative problem-solving to facilitate resident physicians' understanding of new concepts.

Abstract: Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) provide lifesaving care to sick and injured patients. After completing a state-approved course with cognitive and psychomotor training, EMT certification requires passing the National Registry computer-based adaptive exam. This study examined whether delays in taking the exam are associated with failure and provides context on the EMT role and certification process in the United States. Purpose Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) provide lifesaving care to sick and injured patients. After completing a state-approved course with cognitive and psychomotor training, EMT certification requires passing the National Registry computer-based adaptive exam. This study examined whether delays in taking the exam are associated with failure and provides context on the EMT role and certification process in the United States.Data included pass/fail results from 714 students who completed EMT courses between January 2013 and June 2025 at a large public university in Los Angeles County, California. All courses used similar curricula, equipment, facilities, instructors, and competencies. The study analyzed first-attempt exam outcomes relative to the time elapsed between course completion and testing. Methodology Data included pass/fail results from 714 students who completed EMT courses between January 2013 and June 2025 at a large public university in Los Angeles County, California. All courses used similar curricula, equipment, facilities, instructors, and competencies. The study analyzed first-attempt exam outcomes relative to the time elapsed between course completion and testing.Students who tested within 15-45 days had comparable pass rates, with the highest success among those testing within 30 days. Passage rates declined significantly after 45 days, and delays beyond 60 days were strongly associated with failure. These results indicate that the best chance of passing occurs when the exam is taken within 1-45 days of course completion. Findings Students who tested within 15-45 days had comparable pass rates, with the highest success among those testing within 30 days. Passage rates declined significantly after 45 days, and delays beyond 60 days were strongly associated with failure. These results indicate that the best chance of passing occurs when the exam is taken within 1-45 days of course completion.This study demonstrates that delaying the National Registry EMT exam increases the likelihood of failure, particularly after 60 days. The findings can guide administrators and instructors in advising students to minimize delays and may inform curriculum adjustments to support long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: This review examines the current state of virtual reality (VR) applications in preclinical and clinical medical education, emphasizing their impact on teaching effectiveness and clinical competence. A structured literature analysis was conducted to evaluate VR-based educational strategies across key medical domains, including anatomy, biochemistry, histology, surgery, emergency medicine, neurology, pediatrics, psychiatry, radiology, and rehabilitation. The reviewed studies demonstrate that VR enhances procedural performance, improves knowledge retention, strengthens diagnostic accuracy, and supports the acquisition of non-technical skills such as communication and teamwork. VR applications were also shown to reduce patient anxiety and pain during clinical procedures and improve engagement in rehabilitation programs. Despite persisting challenges such as cost, accessibility, and technical limitations, current evidence supports the growing role of VR as an effective, scalable, and safe educational and clinical tool. This review highlights critical opportunities for integrating VR into medical curricula and outlines future research directions aimed at optimizing its implementation in healthcare education.

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly shaping medical education through adaptive learning systems, simulations, and large language models. These tools can enhance knowledge retention, clinical reasoning, and feedback, while raising concerns related to equity, bias, and institutional readiness. Methods: This narrative review examined AI applications in medical and health-profession education. A structured search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (2010–October 2025), supplemented by grey literature, identified empirical studies, reviews, and policy documents addressing AI-supported instruction, simulation, communication, procedural skills, assessment, or faculty development. Non-educational clinical AI studies were excluded. Results: AI facilitates personalized and interactive learning, improving clinical reasoning, communication practice, and simulation-based training. However, linguistic bias in Natural language processing (NLP) tools may disadvantage non-native English speakers, and limited digital infrastructure hinders adoption in rural or low-resource settings. When designed inclusively, AI can amplify accessibility for learners with disabilities. Faculty and students commonly report low confidence and infrequent use of AI tools, yet most support structured training to build competence. Conclusions: AI can shift medical education toward more adaptive, learner-centered models. Effective adoption requires addressing bias, ensuring equitable access, strengthening infrastructure, and supporting faculty development. Clear governance policies are essential for safe and ethical integration.

Abstract: This study informs the design of VR-based training in technical education by demonstrating that high immersion can impose cognitive costs for novice learners. Educators and developers can apply these insights to sequence VR after foundational instruction and incorporate cognitive load-aware design features such as signaling and guided narration. The results support using VR as a complementary tool within blended learning frameworks, helping institutions and industry trainers enhance learner focus, retention, and practical skill development while minimizing cognitive overload. As immersive technologies increasingly permeate education and professional training, their cognitive implications for novice learners remain underexplored. This study examines the relative effectiveness of virtual reality (VR)-based instruction compared with conventional teaching modalities in a controlled experimental setting. A total of 106 undergraduate medical students with no prior technical experience were randomly assigned to one of three instructional conditions: (1) PowerPoint-based presentation, (2) real-person demonstration, or (3) immersive VR simulation of a five-axis CNC machine. Participants’ cognitive ability was assessed using Raven’s Progressive Matrices, and their learning styles were measured via the Honey and Mumford questionnaire. Immediate knowledge retention was evaluated through a 20-item multiple-choice test. Results revealed a significant main effect of instructional method on post-test performance ( p < 0.001), with the real-person group achieving the highest mean score, followed by PowerPoint and VR groups. IQ was a significant predictor of performance across conditions but did not moderate the effect of instructional method. Gender and learning-style preferences showed no meaningful associations with learning outcomes. The findings suggest that, for novice learners engaging with complex technical content, immersive VR may impose additional cognitive demands that hinder immediate knowledge acquisition. These results contribute empirical support to Cognitive Load Theory and the Cognitive Affective Model of Immersive Learning, emphasizing the need for careful instructional design and cognitive scaffolding in VR-based education.

Abstract: Emergency medicine conferences play a pivotal role in advancing clinical knowledge, fostering professional networks, and improving patient outcomes. However, traditional large-scale formats face challenges in ensuring diversity, inclusivity, and participant engagement. This study investigates the effect of different medical conference experiences - traditional versus interactive - on the overall experience ratings of 143 healthcare professionals. The research also examines how professional role, experience level, and primary motivation for attendance influence these ratings. Background Emergency medicine conferences play a pivotal role in advancing clinical knowledge, fostering professional networks, and improving patient outcomes. However, traditional large-scale formats face challenges in ensuring diversity, inclusivity, and participant engagement. This study investigates the effect of different medical conference experiences - traditional versus interactive - on the overall experience ratings of 143 healthcare professionals. The research also examines how professional role, experience level, and primary motivation for attendance influence these ratings.This study aims to assess the impact of alternative conference formats on engagement, inclusivity, and knowledge dissemination, with the goal of informing strategies to design more equitable and impactful emergency medicine conferences. Objective This study aims to assess the impact of alternative conference formats on engagement, inclusivity, and knowledge dissemination, with the goal of informing strategies to design more equitable and impactful emergency medicine conferences.Data were analyzed using a two-way mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a paired-samples t-test. The findings indicate a statistically significant preference for interactive sessions over traditional ones across the entire sample (M=4.06 vs. M=3.75, p<.001). This preference was particularly strong among participants motivated by networking. Methods Data were analyzed using a two-way mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a paired-samples t-test. The findings indicate a statistically significant preference for interactive sessions over traditional ones across the entire sample (M=4.06 vs. M=3.75, p<.001). This preference was particularly strong among participants motivated by networking.However, the study also revealed a nuanced relationship between professional experience and satisfaction, with late-career professionals (20+ years) rating their overall experience significantly lower than their less-experienced counterparts. The consistently high ratings for hands-on workshops across all groups highlight their universal value. These results suggest that tailoring conference content to meet the diverse needs of attendees, especially by incorporating more interactive and applied learning opportunities, can significantly enhance engagement and satisfaction.

Abstract: Neuroanatomy is a crucial component of the physiotherapy curriculum, but its complexity can lead to "neurophobia" among students. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods by providing interactive and realistic three-dimensional images of neurological structures. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of IVR for learning neuroanatomy and to assess student satisfaction and motivation. We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial with 67 second-year physiotherapy students. Besides didactic lectures, students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first was an IVR group (n = 34), in which students studied autonomously using the MetaQuest 2 IVR device with the SharecareYOU VR application (60 min), after having received instructions on how to use it (30 min). The second group (n = 33) followed a traditional learning approach using anatomical atlases and textbooks (90 min). Knowledge retention was assessed through an 18-item questionnaire, while satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and usability of the IVR headset were evaluated using other questionnaires. Evaluations were carried out immediately after the intervention, and four weeks later. The IVR group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge retention overall (p < 0.001) as well as in specific areas, such as theoretical understanding, spatial location, and labeling of brain areas (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were maintained 4 weeks after the intervention (p = 0.37). Additionally, IVR students reported greater satisfaction (p < 0.001) and found it useful for learning (p < 0.001) without adverse events. Our findings show that IVR is a safe supplementary tool that is more effective for enhancing neuroanatomical education in physiotherapy than textbooks and atlases.

Abstract: Background The use of electronic or digital resources has been shown to be effective in improving knowledge retention and skills development through many fields of medical education. Few systematic reviews have studied the effects of electronic learning (‘e-learning’) compared to traditional learning methods in anaesthesia education. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies assessing learning outcomes from e-learning modalities compared to ‘traditional’, face-to-face or didactic teaching methods. Methods Medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, Scopus, CENTRAL, Google Scholar) were searched for applicable studies from January 2002 to January 2023 on the 12th of February 2023. Studies comparing an ‘e-learning arm’ against a ‘traditional learning’ arm including anaesthetic doctors of any level within the study population were considered and assessed for inclusion. The systematic review tool Covidence™ was utilised to track studies for inclusion, results were synthesised be each reviewer prior to independent assessment for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool ‘RoB-2’. Results Our search strategy identified 1681 papers for review. Thirteen studies were deemed eligible for inclusion, assessing 572 health practitioners at varying stages of their clinical careers. Four eligible studies showed a statistically significant difference in their primary outcomes favouring e-learning, while one study found e-learning non-inferior to traditional learning. Three studies found a statistically significant change in favour of traditional learning and the remaining five studies did not find a significant difference when comparing e-learning and traditional learning. Qualitative analysis of various secondary outcomes (where applicable) found considerable variation regarding participant preference in favour of both traditional and e-learning models. Conclusion E-learning is an important adjunct to traditional learning methods and when undertaken in the appropriate clinical teaching context, outcomes from e-learning programs can outperform those from traditional learning methodologies. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the research and shows no consistent benefit to either e-learning or traditional learning. Further research is required to explore the most effective teaching contexts and the efficient implementation of different e-learning modalities in anaesthesia.

Abstract: Background Artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into health professions education, but evidence regarding their application in physiotherapy remains limited. This study aims to investigate the impact of AI-assisted problem-based learning (AI-PBL) on theoretical knowledge, clinical competence, AI self-efficacy, internet addiction, and reading motivation compared with traditional PBL. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with undergraduate physiotherapy students assigned to AI-PBL or PBL groups. Participants completed assessments before, immediately after, and two weeks after the group intervention. Outcome measures included a theoretical knowledge test, the Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX), the AI ​​Self-Efficacy Scale (AI-SES), the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), and the Adult Reading Motivation Scale (ARMS). Results Forty students were randomized equally into two groups: AI-PBL ( n  = 20) and traditional PBL ( n  = 20). Both groups showed significant improvements in knowledge and reading motivation. The AI-PBL group showed significantly greater improvement in knowledge retention at 2 weeks (Cohen’s d  = 3.14) and greater gains in AI self-efficacy. Although Mini-CEX scores were higher in the AI-PBL group, the differences between groups were not statistically significant. No significant increase in internet addiction was observed in the AI-PBL group. Conclusion These findings emphasize that supervised, structured use of generative AI in education can enhance sustained learning and digital self-efficacy without posing behavioral risks. The AI-PBL approach appears to foster active reflection, self-directed learning, and deeper academic engagement offering a promising direction for digital innovation in physiotherapy education. Future studies should explore long-term outcomes, track behavioral engagement, and further validate the benefits of AI-enhanced instructional strategies. Trial registration Prior to the initiation of the study, the protocol was registered on https//www.clinicaltrials.gov/, and registration status was made publicly available (Identifier NCT07010991 Date 08.06.2025). (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07010991?term=NCT07010991&rank=1).

Abstract: Introduction Medical virology requires students to master complex concepts in a limited timeframe, yet traditional lectures often struggle to sustain engagement and ensure long-term retention. Serious games have emerged as promising tools to promote active learning. Building on the success of BacteriaGame, ViroGame was developed to reinforce virology knowledge through gamification. This study evaluated its effectiveness in enhancing student engagement, knowledge mobilization, and supervisor-perceived feasibility for curricular integration. Materials and methods A total of 318 learners participated in ViroGame sessions during the 2023–2024 academic year. Of these, 266 students/residents completed a structured questionnaire assessing with likert scale [1,2,3,4,5] gameplay fluidity, knowledge consolidation, perceived difficulty and potential integration with BacteriaGame. Nine supervisors also provided evaluations on rule clarity, session management and educational value. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann–Whitney U tests and Chi-squared tests, with qualitative feedback examined thematically. Results Residents rated gameplay fluidity significantly higher than students (4.4/5 vs. 4.1/5; p  = 0.039). Both groups reported high knowledge mobilization scores (students 4.5/5; residents 4.3/5; p  = 0.378). Nearly half perceived some content as exceeding expected knowledge, despite alignment with national standards (47.4% vs. 41.8%; p  = 0.482). A greater proportion of students than residents reported difficulties with virological concepts (78.9% vs. 60.3%; p  = 0.021), particularly regarding diagnostic methods and viral structures. Supervisors rated the game positively, endorsing its use primarily as a revision tool. Discussion ViroGame is a well-received, effective and engaging tool for teaching medical virology. It promotes active learning, collaboration and knowledge retention while addressing the inherent complexity of virology. Further controlled studies are planned to evaluate its long-term impact on learning outcomes and exam performance.

Abstract: Background Virtual Simulation Experiments (VSE) are increasingly applied in medical education, yet their role in medical microbiology remains underexplored. This study evaluated a VSE system designed for the isolation, culture, and identification of enteric pathogens, framed by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). Methods Ninety medical students were randomly assigned to either a VSE group or a traditional teaching group. Outcomes were assessed through operational skill and knowledge tests, supplemented by qualitative feedback. Results The VSE group achieved higher scores in operational skills (89.6 ± 5.2 vs. 81.8 ± 6.3, p  < 0.01) and knowledge retention (87.4 ± 4.4 vs. 81.8 ± 5.0, p  < 0.01). Students reported that VSE’ immersive environment and instant feedback enhanced satisfaction and autonomy, aligning with SDT. Conclusions VSE significantly improved learning outcomes in medical microbiology and promoted intrinsic motivation. These findings provide empirical support for integrating VSE into medical curricula and highlight the need for further research on its long-term and broader educational impact.

Abstract: Background : Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses deep neural networks by transferring knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model. However, conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy, mAP, IoU, or RMSE focus mainly on task performance and overlook how effectively the student internalizes the teacher’s knowledge. Methods : This study introduces the Knowledge Retention Score (KRS), a composite metric that integrates intermediate feature similarity and output agreement into a single interpretable score to quantify knowledge retention. KRS was primarily validated in computer vision (CV) through 36 experiments covering image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation using diverse datasets and eight representative KD methods. Supplementary experiments were conducted in natural language processing (NLP) using transformer-based models on SST-2, and in time series regression with convolutional teacher–student pairs. Results : Across all domains, KRS correlated strongly with standard performance metrics while revealing internal retention dynamics that conventional evaluations often overlook. By reporting feature similarity and output agreement separately alongside the composite score, KRS provides transparent and interpretable insights into knowledge transfer. Conclusions : KRS offers a stable diagnostic tool and a complementary evaluation metric for KD research. Its generality across domains demonstrates its potential as a standardized framework for assessing knowledge retention beyond task-specific performance measures.

Abstract: With the recent intensification of geopolitical tensions, cyber-attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. Traditional machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques, which rely on pre-trained data, often suffer from performance degradation when exposed to novel attack types not seen during training. To address this limitation, this study proposes a continual learning-based anomaly detection framework capable of incrementally incorporating new attack patterns without forgetting previously learned information. The proposed method consists of three key stages: first, preprocessing and data augmentation are applied to construct high-quality, balanced datasets; second, a base anomaly detection model is trained; and third, new attack data are incrementally integrated to continuously update and evaluate the model. To enhance adaptability and efficiency, the framework incorporates Memory-LGBM, a lightweight architecture that combines a prototype-based memory module with a gradient-free LGBM classifier. The model maintains class-wise latent representations instead of raw samples, enabling compact, memory-efficient learning. Experimental results on the CICIDS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing continual learning methods in accuracy, adaptability, and resistance to forgetting, making it a practical and scalable solution for real-world anomaly detection scenarios that demand rapid adaptation, strong knowledge retention, and low computational overhead.

Abstract: To address the problem of inaccurate matching between personalized exercise recommendations and learners’ mastery of knowledge concepts/learning abilities, we propose the Dynamic Multidimensional Memory Augmented knowledge tracing model (DMMA). This model integrates a dynamic key-value memory neural network with the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. By incorporating time decay factors and knowledge concept mastery speed factors, it dynamically adjusts knowledge update intensity, effectively resolving the insufficient personalized recommendation capabilities of traditional models. Experimental validation demonstrates its effectiveness: on Algebra 2006–2007, DMMA achieves 82% accuracy, outperforming CRDP-KT by 6%, while maintaining 53–55% accuracy for cold-start users (0–5 interactions), which is 25% higher than CoKT. The model’s integration of the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and K-means-based concept classification enhances adaptability. Genetic algorithm optimization yields a diversity score of 0.79, with 18% higher 30-day knowledge retention. The FastDTW–Sigmoid hybrid similarity calculation (weight transition 0.27–0.88) ensures smooth cold-start adaptation, while novelty metrics reach 0.65 via random-forest-driven prediction. Ablation studies confirm component necessity: removing time decay factors reduces accuracy by 2.2%. These results validate DMMA’s superior performance in personalized education.

Abstract: Background The integration of gamification in educational settings has emerged as an innovative strategy to enhance student engagement and knowledge retention, particularly in complex fields like dentistry. This descriptive, survey-based study investigates the impact of gamified lectures on the learning experiences of undergraduate dental students in endodontic instrument education. Methods By incorporating interactive elements such as real-time quizzes, live polls, and immediate feedback, the research explores how gamification can transform traditional passive learning environments. The study involved undergraduate dental students and employed a structured survey questionnaire to assess engagement, knowledge retention, and student perceptions. Results Quantitative analysis using SPSS revealed significant findings: 56.6% of students rated the lectures as "very engaging" or "extremely engaging", and 66% reported that gamification significantly contributed to their understanding of the subject matter. Correlation analyses demonstrated positive relationships between engagement, retention, and satisfaction, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.535 (p = 0.003) to 0.621 (p < 0.01). The results underscore the potential of gamification in dental education, particularly in enhancing student engagement and perceived understanding. However, the findings reflect short-term, self-reported outcomes and do not yet confirm long-term knowledge retention, which warrants further investigation. Conclusion The results underscore the potential of gamification in dental education, highlighting its effectiveness in motivating active participation and improving learning outcomes. By providing empirical evidence of gamification's benefits, this study contributes valuable insights for curriculum development and innovative pedagogical approaches in health professions education.

Abstract: The integration of technology in medical education has led to the adoption of hybrid teaching methods, combining online lectures with traditional face-to-face clinical practice. While this approach offers flexibility and safety, it raises questions about the impact of potential time lapses between theoretical learning and hands-on experience. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the time interval between online lectures and on-site clinical practice on medical students' performance in orthopedic rotation. Introduction The integration of technology in medical education has led to the adoption of hybrid teaching methods, combining online lectures with traditional face-to-face clinical practice. While this approach offers flexibility and safety, it raises questions about the impact of potential time lapses between theoretical learning and hands-on experience. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the time interval between online lectures and on-site clinical practice on medical students' performance in orthopedic rotation.A retrospective study was conducted on 116 fifth-year medical students who completed their orthopedic rotation during the 2021/2022 academic year. Students underwent a one-week online course followed by three weeks of on-site clinical practice, with varying time lapses (0-38 weeks) between these periods. Performance was assessed through examinations including key features test (KF), multiple-choice questions (MCQ), multiple-essay questions (MEQ), objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and long case examination. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze the relationship between time lapse and examination scores.

Results The analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the time lapse duration and KF scores (p 0.05).This study demonstrates that the time lapse between online lectures and clinical rotation in orthopedic education significantly impacts students' performance in key features tests. However, other examination scores remained unaffected. These findings highlight the need for careful scheduling and potential interventions to mitigate the effects of extended time lapses on specific aspects of medical knowledge retention and application in orthopedic education. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the time lapse between online lectures and clinical rotation in orthopedic education significantly impacts students' performance in key features tests. However, other examination scores remained unaffected.

Abstract: Across the world, people are exploring fields where AI (Artificial Intelligence) and VR (Virtual Reality) can be harnessed to unlock new possibilities and drive innovation. The aim of this article was to review the potential and assess the feasibility of using virtual reality technology in soft skills training (including people management, stress management, communication, conflict resolution, and sales). A project was developed featuring an application that utilizes virtual reality and artificial intelligence to facilitate communication with a virtual coach. The application operates on Meta Quest 3 virtual reality goggles (Meta Platforms, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA). Tests of the presented solution confirm market trends, highlighting the potential for achieving positive training outcomes through immersive technologies. The conclusions outline opportunities for improvement and further development of such solutions. This study applied a quasi-experimental model with pretest, posttest, and four-week follow-up measurements. The effectiveness of VR training was evaluated using a knowledge test (0–100%), a self-assessment scale of soft skills (Likert 1–5), expert behavior observation (0–10 scale), and posttraining surveys. The VR group demonstrated significantly higher gains in knowledge, soft skills, and behavioral performance with knowledge retention reaching 89% after four weeks. These results confirm the effectiveness of immersive VR training and its alignment with current market trends in innovative professional development.

Abstract: Background: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010–January 2025) using keywords: “problem-based learning”, “case-based learning”, “gynecology education”, “residency training”. Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Results: Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice. Conclusion: PBL and CBL are transformative pedagogical strategies for gynecology residency training, effectively developing competencies needed for complex clinical practice. Successful implementation requires rigorously designed cases, faculty trained in facilitative guidance, and strategic technology integration. These approaches prepare residents not only as skilled technicians but as adaptable, patient-centered practitioners capable of navigating evolving healthcare challenges. Investment in faculty development and technology-enhanced PBL/CBL models is crucial for advancing gynecologic education globally.

Abstract: Type 2 diabetes is a growing concern among young adults, including college students, due to rates of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and limited disease awareness. Despite the risk, few studies have examined the effectiveness of targeted educational interventions among this population. To determine whether a pharmacy student-led educational session improves knowledge, retention, and motivation for behavior change related to type 2 diabetes prevention among undergraduate students. A group of third-year pharmacy students conducted 30-minute interactive educational sessions on a college campus in North Carolina. The sessions covered risk factors, prevention strategies, and healthy behaviors using slides, interactive questions, and video clips. Participants completed a presurvey, immediate postsurvey, and a 2- to 3-month follow-up survey assessing knowledge and self-reported behaviors. A paired t test and ANOVA with post hoc analysis evaluated changes in knowledge over time. Sixty-four students completed both the pre- and postsurveys. Knowledge scores significantly improved from pre- to postsurvey (7.0 ± 1.6 to 9.7 ± 1.4; P < 0.001). Of the 17 students completing the follow-up survey, knowledge remained significantly higher than baseline (pre: 6.4 ± 1.27; post: 8.7 ± 1.31; follow-up: 9.9 ± 2.28; P < 0.001). Participants reported increased motivation to adopt healthier behaviors, such as physical activity, improved nutrition using the Plate Method, and adequate sleep. An interactive, pharmacy student-led educational session significantly improved college students' knowledge and motivation to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Tailored, engaging outreach may be an effective strategy to address early prevention in at-risk college populations.

Abstract: Objective Emergency medical service (EMS) professionals are increasingly using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) into the prehospital management and triage of critically ill patients. However, few institutions offer organized POCUS training for this community. Our goal was to offer and evaluate the effectiveness of a simulation-based POCUS course for EMS professionals. Methods We developed and implemented an eight-hour course to train EMS providers in the fundamentals of POCUS for blunt trauma patients. The course design included lectures, standardized patients hands-on scanning, simulation-based ultrasound cases, clinical cases based on real patients, and an end-of-course review game. Before the day of the course, participants were assigned e-learning modules on the fundamentals of POCUS and on the Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma Exam (eFAST). The effectiveness of the course was evaluated using Kirkpatrick’s methodology for Level 1 (course evaluation by participants) and Level 2 (pre- and post-course knowledge assessments including image interpretation). Pre- and post-knowledge scores were presented using means and ranges. Percent improvements and a paired sample t-test with the effect size (Cohen’s d) were used to compare pre-post improvements. For course evaluation ratings, the mean Likert scale rating was calculated. Results A total of 128 learners (103 paramedics, 22 flight nurses, and one EMS physician from 32 EMS agencies, as well as two United States Army medics, completed the course. The average age of participants was 39.0 years, and 98 (76.6%) were male. The pre-course assessment mean knowledge score was 67.6% (95% CI 64.7–70.5). The post-course mean knowledge score was 89.0% (95% CI 87.3–97.0), resulting in a 21.4% point increase ( p  <.001; Cohen’ s d  = 1.52). We received 122 course evaluations. Participants expressed nearly unanimous strong agreement across all measures, with a mean rating ranging from 4.8 to 4.9 on a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire. Conclusions Our data suggests that an 8-hour POCUS course, incorporating e-learning and simulation, can significantly improve EMS providers’ knowledge of the fundamentals of POCUS and image interpretation of eFAST examination in trauma patients. Course evaluation results are highly supportive of this course’s benefits. As EMS agencies increasingly incorporate POCUS for patient care, effective and efficient training methodologies will be critical for successful implementation. Our course offers one approach as part of a comprehensive training program. Further studies should assess POCUS utilization and sustained knowledge retention. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Standardized training for orthopedic and traumatology residents is a crucial component of postgraduate medical education. Traditional teaching methods, such as Lecture-Based Learning (LBL), often fail to stimulate student initiative and clinical thinking. To address this, our study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a combined Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Standardized Patients (SP) teaching method in enhancing the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 59 orthopedic residents from three medical institutions in China. The participants were randomly divided into a control group ( n  = 29) receiving traditional LBL combined with SP and a study group ( n  = 30) receiving PBL combined with SP. Both groups were instructed on common orthopedic diseases for 21 h. Teaching effectiveness was assessed through self-designed electronic questionnaires, classroom performance metrics, and final exams. Results Compared with the control group, the study group demonstrated significantly greater levels of self-study initiative, teamwork ability, classroom learning efficiency, learning interest, and clinical processing ability ( P  < 0.05). The study group also showed greater improvement in their ability to handle clinical problems and had higher postclass knowledge retention and learning interest scores ( P  < 0.05). Practical exam scores and overall scores were significantly higher in the study group ( P  < 0.05), although written exam scores did not differ significantly. Conclusions The combined PBL and SP teaching method was found to be superior to traditional LBL in improving the clinical skills and self-learning abilities of orthopedic residents. This approach enhances student engagement, clinical thinking, and overall educational outcomes, suggesting that it is a valuable addition to orthopedic resident training programs.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/combined-impact-ai-vr-on-interdisciplinary/docview/3236996893/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Introduction The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in healthcare education offers innovative ways to enhance collaborative learning and improve patient safety. This narrative review examines the synergistic impact of AI-powered virtual reality (VR) simulations, such as those used in surgical training and patient communication, on knowledge acquisition, clinical skill development, and collaborative competencies among healthcare students. It also explores long-term knowledge retention, ethical considerations within virtual scenarios, and the psychological impact of high-stakes simulations on learner resilience. Methods This review is distinguished by its exhaustive literature search, which spanned PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Google Scholar, and other pertinent databases, to identify studies published between 2005 and 2024. The distinct focus on AI and VR interventions in healthcare education, particularly those with outcomes related to interdisciplinary learning or patient safety, distinguishes this review. Data were thematically analyzed across domains, including adaptive learning, technical skill development, teamwork, patient safety, and ethics. Results The findings of this review carry significant practical implications. Five key themes emerged: adaptive learning ( n  = 17), immersive skill development ( n  = 10), teamwork enhancement ( n  = 10), patient safety ( n  = 18), and ethical considerations ( n  = 21). These themes underscore the potential of AI and VR in healthcare education. AI-driven adaptive systems enabled personalized VR training, enhancing engagement and knowledge retention. Real-time AI feedback during simulations improved decision-making in safe, controlled environments. Interdisciplinary team simulations enhanced communication and collaboration, which are crucial for effective clinical care. Ethical modules embedded in VR scenarios promoted moral reasoning. Several studies also reported increased learner confidence in performing clinical procedures following VR training, suggesting enhanced preparedness for practice. Conclusion The integration of AI and VR holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare education, fostering personalized, immersive, and ethically informed learning. These technologies enhance technical proficiency and equip students with the complex demands of modern clinical practice. Strategic implementation can contribute to error reduction, improved patient outcomes, and a culture of safety. However, the journey is not over. Continued research is crucial for assessing the long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these educational innovations, as well as for keeping pace with the rapidly evolving field of AI and VR in healthcare education.

Abstract: Background Learning about neurological syndromes is an essential component of medical education, but traditional teaching methods often lack interactivity and practical engagement. This study investigates the impact of an innovative teaching approach using the Neurological Syndrome Card Game (NSCG) on students’ learning outcomes. Methods A randomized controlled trial design was implemented, with participants divided into an experimental group and a control group. The control group received traditional lecture-based instruction (e.g., PowerPoint presentations and case analyses), whereas the experimental group engaged in NSCG-based learning. The game involved card-matching competitions and anatomical injury location tasks to enhance students’ recognition, understanding, and memory of neurological syndromes. Learning outcomes were evaluated through assessments of learning effectiveness, knowledge retention rates, cognitive load, and learning experience. Results A total of 48 students participated in the study. No significant differences were found in baseline characteristics between the groups. Following the intervention, the experimental group showed significantly better immediate learning effects at 1 week (13.33 ± 2.12 vs. 11.92 ± 1.44, t = 3.344, P  = 0.002), 3 weeks (12.83 ± 2.04 vs. 10.63 ± 1.86, t = 3.923, P  = 0.000), and 6 weeks (10.04 ± 1.20 vs. 7.79 ± 1.61, t = 5.484, P  = 0.000). In terms of long-term memory retention, the experimental group demonstrated superior knowledge retention rates at all time points: 22.53% at week 1, 29.49% at week 3, and 31.12% at week 6. Regarding cognitive load, the experimental group exhibited significantly lower total scores (46.96 ± 1.65 vs. 69.08 ± 4.06) and scores across all dimensions ( P  < 0.05). Evaluations of the learning experience indicated that students in the experimental group rated their interest and memory outcomes more positively. Conclusion The NSCG-based teaching method significantly enhances students’ learning and memory retention of neurological syndromes, reduces cognitive load, and increases learning interest. This method may be a useful approach for enhancing clinical syndrome teaching in medical education.

Abstract: Gynecology residency training necessitates a robust educational framework to cultivate clinical competency, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Traditional lecture-based teaching methods are deficient in fostering active learning and clinical decision-making. Problem-based learning (PBL) and case-based learning (CBL) have emerged as learner-centered approaches that enhance medical education by integrating theoretical knowledge with clinical practice. This review aims to explain the efficacy, implementation frameworks, challenges, and comparative value of PBL and CBL in gynecology residency education, and explores the role of instructional technology integration.

Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted across PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, Embase, and EBSCO (January 2010-January 2025) using keywords: "problem-based learning", "case-based learning", "gynecology education", "residency training". Inclusion criteria encompassed studies on PBL/CBL interventions in gynecology residency with qualitative/quantitative outcomes. Ten articles met the criteria after screening.Both PBL and CBL significantly outperform in enhancing clinical decision-making, differential diagnosis, knowledge retention, procedural planning, and long-term knowledge application. PBL utilizes open-ended problems to cultivate self-directed learning, critical thinking, and collaborative problem-solving (eg, managing complex AUB etiologies). CBL employs structured clinical cases to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, improving diagnostic reasoning and patient management skills. Key implementation frameworks involve careful pre-session preparation, facilitator-guided discussions on authentic cases, and structured feedback. Challenges include significant faculty time for case design/facilitation, resource intensity, and competency assessment. PBL fosters deep theoretical understanding, while CBL excels in clinical skill translation. Integrating both approaches creates a balanced curriculum. Augmenting PBL/CBL with simulation, flipped classrooms, mobile learning, and AI enhances accessibility, personalization, and procedural skill practice.

Abstract: Research shows mnemonics promote knowledge retention in different contexts; hence, they are increasingly being used in serious games aimed to support long-term learning while providing “edutainment.” However, there is limited research on their effectiveness. As such, we conducted a systematic review of 32 mnemonics mobile apps and evaluated them using two established frameworks from the literature. Our analysis revealed that most of the games teach language or medicine, take the form of puzzles or quizzes, and feature acronyms and/or images, with players rating them at least three out of five stars on average. All 32 apps supported feedback, interactivity, and challenge. A few supported agency, identity and self-presence, while many did not support key characteristics such as social and spatial presences. The overall finding indicates a need to create a mnemonics-based and tailored framework to guide the design of mnemonics games in the future to make them more effective.

Abstract: Traditional didactic teaching methods in medical education, while foundational, often lead to passive learning and insufficient engagement. "Pancreata--The Keto Struggle," an educational tale-based game for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), was developed to address these challenges by promoting collaborative learning, enhancing student engagement, and improving knowledge retention through an interactive and narrative-driven approach. This study involved 150 first-year medical students divided into 25 small groups of 6 each. Participants were assessed before and after engaging with the game through a structured formative assessment, a validated questionnaire measuring engagement and learning effectiveness, and a confidence level questionnaire. In-depth small-group interviews were also conducted for qualitative feedback and thematic analysis was performed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 17. The introduction of "Pancreata--The Keto Struggle" resulted in significant improvements in students' formative assessment scores, from a mean of 19.2 ± 1.9 before the game to 39.3 ± 2.2 out of 50 after the game (p < 0.0001). Notably, students demonstrated the highest confidence gains in managing DKA and interpreting laboratory results. Qualitative analysis identified seven common themes reflecting the game's impact on learning: collaboration, retention of concepts, internal drive, self and peer assessment, joyful learning, beyond books, and aesthetic content. Over 95% of students reported increased engagement and learning effectiveness due to the game's intrinsic motivation, narrative, and group learning mechanics. "Pancreata--The Keto Struggle" effectively revitalizes collaborative learning in medical education by integrating game-based learning with traditional teaching methods. The game not only facilitates a deeper understanding of complex clinical conditions like DKA but also broadly improves students' clinical management skills and confidence. These findings underscore the potential of educational tale based games to enrich medical education and advocate for their broader application across curricula.

Abstract: Background Active learning approaches that promote participation, critical thinking, and practical competency are becoming more and more necessary in medical and nursing education. Virtual reality (VR) and gamification, especially in the context of escape rooms, have become popular instructional technology in response to these issues. The interactive, scenario-based learning environments provided by these tools encourage motivation, teamwork, and decision-making. The impact and transformative possibilities of incorporating virtual reality and gamified escape rooms into medical and nursing education are examined in this paper. Methods The use of virtual reality (VR), gamification, and escape rooms in medical and nursing education was investigated using a thorough narrative literature review. In order to give a comprehensive and holistic overview of new subjects, this method was selected. Keywords like “escape room,” “digital escape room,” “online escape room,” “gamification,” “game-based education,” “virtual reality in medical education,” “medical student,” “nursing education,” “nursing student,” and “nursing staff” were used in the January 10, 2025, search across Web of Science, PubMed, ERIC, and Scopus. English-language publications from the past ten years that addressed virtual reality, gamification, or escape rooms in medical or nursing education were included in the inclusion criteria. Non-relevant papers, non-peer-reviewed literature, and research with unclear methodology or no empirical data were among the exclusion criteria. 25 studies were chosen for a thorough assessment after a rigorous screening process based on methodological rigor and relevance. Results The total number of retrieved articles in Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on January 10, 2025, was 172. After removing 64 duplicate articles, 108 papers were screened by experts. After this investigation, 25 articles were extensively reviewed for the results section. The findings from the selected studies can be categorized into four main areas: enhancing clinical decision-making, improving teamwork and collaboration, increasing knowledge retention and engagement, and reducing stress in high-pressure scenarios. These studies, summarized in Table 1, highlight the effectiveness of escape rooms and VR-based training in medical and nursing education, particularly in emergency medicine, pharmacy, radiology, internal medicine, and psychiatry. Conclusion The integration of VR and gamified escape rooms in healthcare education presents a promising approach to improving clinical training and competency development among medical students, nursing students, and healthcare professionals. The findings underscore the need for further research and implementation of these tools to enhance experiential learning and optimize medical education outcomes. By leveraging gamification and VR simulations, medical training programs can bridge educational gaps and improve patient care delivery in both traditional and remote learning environments. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Medical educationists are concerned that the retention of basic science concepts weakens beyond the early years of medical programs, with clinicians rarely using basic sciences in clinical practice. This study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge retention of physiology courses in medical students at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. Methods This is a cross-sectional study at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. A retention test was conducted in physiology courses using multiple-choice questions. This study included 104 medical students who had completed their basic science courses. The students were in physiopathology, internship, and clerkship were selected. The mean and standard deviation were applied to analyze the data, and a two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, was performed with a significance level of P -value < 0.05. Results The results of this study in retention test scores showed that lost knowledge was revealed throughout the years. Additionally, the results showed that in three subjects—gastrointestinal, nervous system, and respiratory—the scores of students in Y1 were higher than those of students in other years. In the course of endocrinology, the highest mean score belonged to the students who entered medical school in Y4, and the difference in mean scores among the different groups was statistically significant ( P  < 0.001). The mean scores in the urinary system course achieved by the medical students are presented, with students who entered medical school in Y3 having the highest mean scores compared to those in other years. Conclusions The key takeaway is that knowledge retention is not passive; it requires active reinforcement through educational strategies. By prioritizing active learning, integrating clinical relevance, and leveraging strategies like retrieval practice and spaced learning, medical educators can enhance long-term retention and better prepare students for clinical practice.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (genAI) shows promising results in clinical practice. This study compared a GPT-4-turbo virtual assistant with physicians from Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal on medical knowledge derived from national exams while analysing knowledge retention over time and domain-specific performance. Via a digital platform, 17,144 physicians provided 221,574 answers to 600 exam questions between December 2022 and February 2024. Physicians were stratified by years since graduation and specialty, and the assistant answered the same questions in each native language. Differences in proportions of correct answers were tested with binomial logistic regression (odds ratios, 95% CI) or Fisher’s exact test (α = 0.05). The assistant outperformed physicians in all countries (72–96% vs. 46–62%; logistic regression, p < 0.001). Physicians also trailed the assistant across most knowledge domains ( p < 0.001), except paediatrics (45% vs. 52%; Fisher, p = 0.60). Accuracy declined with seniority, falling 4–10% between the youngest and oldest cohorts (logistic regression, p < 0.001). Overall, genAI exceeds practising doctors on broad medical knowledge and may help counter knowledge attrition, though paediatrics remains a domain requiring targeted refinement.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/framework-tacit-knowledge-loss-mitigation-south/docview/3223856914/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In order to mitigate the risks of losing key personnel and their innate tacit knowledge resources, this paper explored a framework for reducing knowledge loss in South African public sector enterprises (PSEs) through the integration of knowledge management (KM) and human resource management (HRM) strategies. The study used a quantitative research design, administering survey questionnaires to 585 randomly selected employees in three South African PSEs. The survey yielded a 25% response rate and was analysed using Statistical Analysis Software, resulting in a Cronbach alpha of 0.94. The findings of the exploratory factor analysis showed that a framework for reducing knowledge loss can be developed by integrating HRM practices and focusing on seven factors: knowledge loss recognition, knowledge management practices, human resource training, organisational culture, recruitment practices, employee retention, and organisational barriers. Three important components constitute the developed framework for knowledge loss minimization. Tacit knowledge loss was recognised as a critical strategic issue based on the results of the chi-square test for independence and logistic regression. This realisation, along with control and intervention variables, created the three main components of the framework. This paper explored the Knowledge Loss Reduction framework, focusing on South African PSEs as a case, to help organisations address the complex tacit knowledge loss prevalent in public and commercial firms worldwide. It contributes to the knowledge-based view, focusing on knowledge-absorptive and -retentive capacities and praxis in knowledge (risk) management and human resource management.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the lack of traditional cadaveric dissection among first year medical students in Anatomy courses in the University of the Philippines College of Medicine. The Learning Enhancement in Anatomy Program (LEAP) was implemented as a bridging program to enhance knowledge and understanding of gross anatomy and histology. As part of this program, a novel multi-strategy teaching method was conducted for the Integumentary and Musculoskeletal Anatomy Module. Background The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the lack of traditional cadaveric dissection among first year medical students in Anatomy courses in the University of the Philippines College of Medicine. The Learning Enhancement in Anatomy Program (LEAP) was implemented as a bridging program to enhance knowledge and understanding of gross anatomy and histology. As part of this program, a novel multi-strategy teaching method was conducted for the Integumentary and Musculoskeletal Anatomy Module.This case study described a novel multi-strategy teaching method on Integumentary and Musculoskeletal anatomy for first year medical students which was done after the COVID-19 pandemic wherein there was a shortage of cadavers. By describing this multi-strategy teaching method, this case study aims to present a potential alternative teaching method in a situation where there is an unexpected shortage of human cadavers. Objective This case study described a novel multi-strategy teaching method on Integumentary and Musculoskeletal anatomy for first year medical students which was done after the COVID-19 pandemic wherein there was a shortage of cadavers. By describing this multi-strategy teaching method, this case study aims to present a potential alternative teaching method in a situation where there is an unexpected shortage of human cadavers.A retrospective review of documents related to this teaching method among first year medical students at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine was conducted from November 15, 2023, to January 15, 2024. The novel teaching method for the Integumentary and Musculoskeletal station was taught using five different methods: proctor demonstration, a prosected lower extremity with a self-directed manual, dissection education videos viewed on a large screen, skeletons for osteology, and individual light microscopes with a self-directed laboratory histology manual. We described the data and analyzed according to strengths and limitations, and formulated recommendations to improve the module. Methods A retrospective review of documents related to this teaching method among first year medical students at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine was conducted from November 15, 2023, to January 15, 2024.

We described the data and analyzed according to strengths and limitations, and formulated recommendations to improve the module.The Integumentary and Musculoskeletal Module of the LEAP provided an interactive, hands-on experience in anatomy education. The five-pronged method facilitated a multifaceted approach to learning through cadaveric prosections, self-directed manuals, dissection videos, osteology exercises, and microscopic study. There was active engagement, overall positive student feedback, and increased post-test scores. However, certain limitations, such as the lack of direct cadaveric dissection, potential underutilization of histology components, and reliance on faculty guidance, highlight areas for improvement.

Student feedback and test performance support the effectiveness of the module, particularly in gross anatomy. Addressing challenges in future iterations will be crucial in refining the program and expanding its applicability to different educational contexts. By building on its strengths and mitigating its weaknesses, this five-pronged method can continue to serve as a model for innovative and effective anatomy education. Conclusion The Integumentary and Musculoskeletal Module of the LEAP has demonstrated significant strengths in enhancing anatomical education through a multimodal approach that fosters active learning, improves knowledge retention, and provides a structured curriculum adaptable to various resource constraints. Student feedback and test performance support the effectiveness of the module, particularly in gross anatomy. Addressing challenges in future iterations will be crucial in refining the program and expanding its applicability to different educational contexts. By building on its strengths and mitigating its weaknesses, this five-pronged method can continue to serve as a model for innovative and effective anatomy education.

Abstract: Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an educational strategy designed for small groups that can be effectively implemented across various educational levels. The aim of TBL is the development of meaningful learning teams, facilitating student interaction and effective communication in problem-solving. It is hypothesized that the use of TBL demonstrates higher levels of satisfaction, engagement and responsibility regarding the acquisition of knowledge than the traditional method of master class. Introduction Team-Based Learning (TBL) is an educational strategy designed for small groups that can be effectively implemented across various educational levels. The aim of TBL is the development of meaningful learning teams, facilitating student interaction and effective communication in problem-solving. It is hypothesized that the use of TBL demonstrates higher levels of satisfaction, engagement and responsibility regarding the acquisition of knowledge than the traditional method of master class.A cross-sectional study was carried out. Twenty-four university students enrolled in the subject of Clinical Reasoning and Evidence Based Practice of the Physiotherapy Master´s programme during the academic year 2022-23 were included. Engagement, satisfaction and preferences were collected through the TBL Student Assessment Instrument (TBL-SAI). Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out. Twenty-four university students enrolled in the subject of Clinical Reasoning and Evidence Based Practice of the Physiotherapy Master´s programme during the academic year 2022-23 were included. Engagement, satisfaction and preferences were collected through the TBL Student Assessment Instrument (TBL-SAI).Twenty-three students were included in the final analysis, with a mean age of 25.29 ± 3.84 years. The results obtained from the TBL-SAI indicated a score of 25.57 on the accountability subscale, 51.04 on the preference for this learning approach subscale, and 32.43 on the overall satisfaction subscale. Results Twenty-three students were included in the final analysis, with a mean age of 25.29 ± 3.84 years. The results obtained from the TBL-SAI indicated a score of 25.57 on the accountability subscale, 51.04 on the preference for this learning approach subscale, and 32.43 on the overall satisfaction subscale.Students found TBL to be engaging, fostering greater responsibility for both individual and group learning. Compared to traditional lectures, TBL sessions were preferred by students, reflecting a higher level of satisfaction with this collaborative learning approach. Further investigation is warranted to assess long-term knowledge retention and to ensure alignment between TBL activities and intended learning objectives. Conclusion Students found TBL to be engaging, fostering greater responsibility for both individual and group learning. Compared to traditional lectures, TBL sessions were preferred by students, reflecting a higher level of satisfaction with this collaborative learning approach.

Abstract: Immersive tools are being adopted as an alternative to traditional education methods, especially in engineering curricula, where it is common to integrate various disciplines such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of immersive tools and serious games in improving student engagement and knowledge retention in engineering education. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, analyzing 31 articles published between 2020 and 2025 across four databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Dimensions, and ScienceDirect). Articles were included if they complied with the following inclusion criteria: using (any) immersive tools, carrying out evaluation methods, and participation of students in STEM-related engineering courses. The data extracted encompassed sample characteristics, game attributes, evaluation methods, and results. The findings suggest that immersive tools positively impact students’ engagement and motivation. However, challenges such as potential motion sickness, complexity of serious games (SGs), and high implementation costs exist. SG design must balance engagement, immersion and pedagogical effectiveness to ensure viability. Future research should assess long-term impacts and promote methodological consistency across studies, particularly in subject areas and sample demographics, while determining a way to reduce motion sickness and alleviating SG complexity and difficulty.

Abstract: Background Nursing is both an art and a science, demanding specific qualities and competencies from students to succeed. These attributes are essential for effective practice and long-term professional growth. If not developed, they may negatively impact patient outcomes and safety, contributing to medical errors, higher mortality rates, and job dissatisfaction. Aim This study examines the impact of collaborative testing on students’ retention of emergency nursing concepts and the development of soft skills. Design A quasi-experimental research design was employed, adhering to the STROBE guidelines. Methods and tools A total of 100 students enrolled in an emergency nursing course participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to either a control group (50 students) or an experimental group (50 students). Data was collected using the Emergency Nursing Academic Achievement Questionnaire and the Collaborative Testing Satisfaction Survey. Results The findings revealed a significant improvement in the intervention group’s post-lecture test scores for tests 2, 3, 4, and 5 ( p  < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the first post-lecture test between the two groups ( p  = 0.415). Additionally, the intervention group demonstrated significantly higher scores in both the mid-term and final written examinations, indicating enhanced retention of course material ( p  < 0.001). Furthermore, 84% of students reported high satisfaction, while 14% expressed moderate satisfaction with the collaborative testing experience. They also perceived an improvement in their soft skills, with an overall score of 95.64 ± 4.35. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that engaging students in collaborative testing significantly enhances their retention of emergency nursing concepts compared to individual testing. Moreover, most students found the collaborative experience highly satisfactory, reporting improvements in their comprehension of course material, critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and engagement, key competencies for nursing professionals. Additionally, students recommended implementing this approach in other courses. Nursing Implications Incorporating collaborative testing into nursing curricula can promote deeper learning and long-term knowledge retention of critical emergency concepts. From a practical standpoint, this model simulates real-world nursing teamwork, allowing students to practice decision-making, communication, and mutual accountability. It can also help reduce test anxiety, encourage peer learning, and better prepare students for interdisciplinary collaboration and emergency response scenarios they will encounter in clinical practice. Nurse educators should consider adopting collaborative assessment strategies as part of a broader pedagogical shift toward active, team-based learning that mirrors the collaborative nature of modern healthcare settings. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Gamification has emerged as a transformative approach in nursing education, especially within simulation-based learning environments. It is recognized for enhancing student engagement, knowledge retention, and confidence. Despite its potential, limited research has explored the perceptions and confidence of nurse educators and students, as well as the challenges encountered during its implementation. The study aimed to assess the perceptions and confidence of nurse educators and nursing students towards integrating gamification into simulation-based nursing education, identify implementation barriers, and develop and validate two psychometric tools: the Gamification Perception Assessment Tool and the Nurse Educator Confidence Tool. Methods A convergent mixed-methods design was utilized, involving 115 nurse educators and 317 nursing students from eight nursing institutions in Cairo. Quantitative data were collected using the newly developed tools, which underwent rigorous validation through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and reliability testing. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured questionnaires and interviews with nurse educators and analyzed thematically to explore implementation challenges. Results The overall mean perception score was 34.8 ± 8.4 for nursing students and 36.3 ± 7.9 for nurse educators, with the majority of participants in both groups showing a high perception level (61.7% for educators and 58.9% for students). Nurse educators displayed moderate to high confidence, which was significantly influenced by their experience and prior training. A strong positive correlation ( r  = 0.711, p  = 0.001) was found between perception and confidence. The psychometric tools demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.68–0.85) and model fit. Thematic analysis revealed barriers such as institutional policy gaps, limited IT support, and lack of training. Conclusion Gamification is positively perceived and fosters educator confidence in simulation-based nursing education. However, successful implementation requires institutional support, faculty training, and standardized evaluation tools to overcome existing challenges and optimize educational outcomes. The study provides validated tools and empirical insights into gamification in nursing education. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Major obstetric hemorrhage is the leading direct cause of maternal mortality throughout the world. To prevent maternal mortality, it is crucial to raise concerns regarding the knowledge and skill levels of the healthcare providers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of simulation-based learning on the knowledge retention and skills of health professionals managing postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in the maternity hospitals of a low-resource country. Methods This was a prospective randomized controlled study consisting of two groups: Control Group was made up of maternity hospital healthcare providers whose training was exclusively theory-based and Intervention Group healthcare providers who underwent simulation training in conjunction with theoretical instruction on diagnosing and managing PPH. The training modules were taken from the John Hopkins University Affiliate (JHPIEGO) Helping Mothers Survive version 2018 training program. The mean percentage of correct answers in MCQs and OSCEs was collected from pre-tests, immediate post-tests, and post-tests at 3- and 6-months post training. Results The post-test immediately after the theoretical training showed an increase in the mean MCQ percentages for both groups. From 47.5 to 66.7% for intervention group versus 49.6–69.6% for control group; no significant difference between the two groups ( p  = 0.285). After simulation training, for the interventional group, the mean percentage increased from 66.7 to 79.2%, an increase of approximately 12%. There was a regression in the mean percentage in both groups in the post-test at 3- and 6-months after the training, but it was much more pronounced in the control group, p  = 0.000. OSCE assessments revealed a statistically significant improvement in skills in interventional group compared to control group ( p  < 0.05). Knowledge and skills diminished over time in control group, bordering on pre-training levels at 6 months post training. The member team in the intervention group had maintained a high level of knowledge and skill 6 months after the training. Conclusion Simulation-based training has a part to play in training healthcare providers to manage post-partum hemorrhage. Training should be repeated after a period of 6 months to enhance knowledge and skill retention. Trial registration NCT05979701.

Abstract: Background Podcasts have become increasingly prominent as tools for health communication, offering flexible and accessible formats for patient education. While widely used in professional training, their role in supporting patient-centered learning remains underexplored. Methods This systematic review synthesized studies published from 2010 to 2024 concerning podcast use in patient education. Five databases—PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Embase—were searched using defined keywords. Studies were selected based on relevance to patient education through podcasts, and outcomes such as knowledge retention, comprehension, and engagement. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Quality assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the CASP checklist. A thematic synthesis approach was employed to analyze qualitative and quantitative findings. Results Of the twenty-one included studies, seven demonstrated improved patient knowledge retention, comprehension, and engagement through podcast use. Five studies emphasized accessibility and learner autonomy, highlighting the benefits of asynchronous and flexible delivery. Three studies explored the integration of podcasts with traditional teaching methods, showing positive outcomes when used as complementary tools. However, three studies identified challenges including content quality variability, limited production standards, and digital access disparities. Thematic synthesis categorized findings into four domains: educational effectiveness, integration with traditional education, accessibility and learner autonomy, and implementation challenges. Conclusions Podcasts represent a promising adjunct to patient education. Their effectiveness depends on thoughtful design, contextual relevance, and equitable delivery. Standardization, blended learning models, and ongoing evaluation are essential for maximizing their impact. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: The study quantitatively explores the differential impact of a Flipped Classroom approach (FC) on specified learning outcomes in an Advanced Auditing and Assurance class for a one-year master's in accounting Programme. It uses a dataset from a Ghanaian university to compare a flipped-classroom approach to a traditional teaching approach. The findings suggest that FC comparatively reduces pre-exam anxiety, improves student's exam scores, and enhances knowledge retention. This study is among a few that explore the impact of FC on Accounting courses in a cultural setting that comparatively adapts slowly to change, and it improves our understanding of different teaching and learning approaches in different contextual, cultural, and geographical settings.

Abstract: Drawing is a teaching tool that provides numerous benefits to student learning, including enhanced knowledge retention, improved observation skills, and increased engagement with course content. However, these exercises also place high cognitive demands on students and require a considerable time commitment. To acknowledge and celebrate the effort students invest in their drawings; while also giving these illustrations curricular significance, a gallery walk can be an effective teaching strategy. During a gallery walk, students move around a learning space to view, analyze, and discuss work displayed on the walls. This article describes an adaptation of a gallery walk, named a 'showcase review session', which was implemented in an undergraduate histology course. This optional session highlighted highly accurate assignment drawings while offering a content review before the final examination. The course instructor created review questions associated with the student drawings, which were projected onto screens around the room. Students could visit the session at any time, with the questions cycling continuously, and the course instructor and teaching assistants circulated to answer questions. Students responded positively to the session, noting that it helped them prepare for their upcoming practical laboratory examination and that showcasing student work added value to the course. Showcase review sessions like the one described can be applied across disciplines, giving students the opportunity to learn from their peers' work while effectively reviewing course content in an engaging and interactive environment.

Abstract: The proposed framework can be integrated into learning platforms to enhance personalized adaptive learning. By leveraging knowledge-driven agents and RAG pipelines, this framework improves the accuracy and effectiveness of AI assistants, while expanding their capabilities through the incorporation of customized knowledge. Continuous updates to the knowledge base enable AI models to dynamically adapt to individual learners, delivering context-aware and precise responses tailored to their needs. This approach is particularly valuable for integrated interdisciplinary learning such as digital transformation, where multidisciplinary knowledge integration plays a crucial role in fostering deeper understanding and knowledge retention. As Large Language Models (LLMs) incorporate generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and complex machine learning algorithms, they have proven to be highly effective in assisting human users with complex professional tasks through natural language interaction. However, in addition to their current capabilities, LLMs occasionally generate responses that contain factual inaccuracies, stemming from their dependence on the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. To avoid such inaccuracies, also known as hallucinations, people use domain-specific knowledge (expertise) to support LLMs in the corresponding task, but the necessary knowledge engineering process usually requires considerable manual effort from experts. In this paper, we developed an approach to leverage the collective strengths of multiple agents to automatically facilitate the knowledge engineering process and then use the learned knowledge and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to optimize the performance of LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Through this approach, we effectively build AI assistants based on particular customized knowledge to help students better carry out personalized adaptive learning in digital transformation. Our initial tests demonstrated that integrating a Knowledge Graph (KG) within a RAG framework significantly improved the quality of domain-specific outputs generated by the LLMs. The results also revealed performance fluctuations for LLMs across varying contexts, underscoring the critical need for domain-specific knowledge support to enhance AI-driven adaptive learning systems.

Abstract: Background Nurses in neonatal intensive care units face critical challenges in managing emergencies where timely, accurate interventions are essential for survival. Traditional nursing education often lacks the hands-on, immersive training required to build complex emergency skills, contributing to persistent neonatal mortality globally. Virtual reality (VR) simulation, grounded in Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory, offers a promising solution by replicating realistic and repeatable clinical scenarios. While VR has shown potential in nursing education, its specific impact on high-risk neonatal emergencies remains underexplored. Aim To evaluate the effectiveness of a VR simulation program in enhancing nurse competency and improving neonatal outcomes during emergency care, grounded in Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory. Methods A concurrent triangulation mixed-methods design was implemented over two weeks across four pediatric hospitals. Through stratified random sampling, 128 NICU nurses were allocated to VR simulation ( n  = 64) or traditional training ( n  = 64) groups. Quantitative data were collected using validated instruments (OSCE: CVI = 0.92, MCQ: α = 0.86) measuring clinical skills, knowledge retention, and decision-making accuracy. Qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews ( n  = 24) exploring experiential aspects. Results The VR group showed significant improvements in clinical skills (OSCE: +16.1 points, p  < 0.001, d = 1.58), decision-making accuracy (+ 16.7%, p  < 0.001), and reduced stabilization times (-6.2 min, p  < 0.001). Patient safety events decreased by 52% ( p  < 0.001). Thematic analysis revealed enhanced professional competence (83%), reduced clinical anxiety (75%), and positive learning experiences (88%), despite minor technical challenges. Conclusion VR simulation demonstrates superior effectiveness for neonatal emergency training, significantly improving both nurse competency and patient outcomes. While geographic specificity and brief follow-up duration limit generalizability, findings support VR’s potential for enhancing emergency preparedness. Future research should address longitudinal outcomes and implementation across diverse healthcare settings. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Leadership is essential for nursing to provide high-quality treatment, productive cooperation, and flexible responses to the always-developing healthcare environment. In nursing educational programs, entrepreneurial leadership places a strong emphasis on cultivating qualities that promote creative problem-solving and inventive thinking. These abilities can be employed in clinical settings to enhance patient care, leadership, innovation, and healthcare delivery. Social learning theory describes how these skills are acquired through learning, imitation, observation, and reinforcement. Aim to investigate the effect of the entrepreneurial leadership intervention program on nurse interns’ work innovation and overall performance in the clinical setting. Methods A two-arm, parallel, open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted at Mansoura University Hospital, Governorate, Egypt. 1026 nurse interns were included in the study. Random assignment was used to place nurse interns in either the study group ( n  = 513) or the control group ( n  = 513) by using the Entrepreneurship Knowledge Questionnaire, Entrepreneurial Leadership Behavior Questionnaire, the Work Innovation Questionnaire, Observation Checklist of Nurses Performance, and Demographic Information Form. Result There were statistically significant differences between the study and control groups in total entrepreneurial knowledge, total entrepreneurial behavior, total work innovation, total performance, and all their dimensions, particularly at the immediate post-intervention and follow-up stages, with p-values of 0.000. The study group demonstrated highly significant improvements in entrepreneurial knowledge, total entrepreneurial behavior, total work innovation, total performance, and all their dimensions, particularly at the immediate post-intervention and follow-up stages, with p-values of 0.000. Conclusion This study demonstrates the significant impact of a structured entrepreneurial educational program on enhancing entrepreneurial behavior, work innovation, and performance among nurse interns. The intervention led to substantial and sustained improvements in various professional competencies, with the study group consistently outperforming the control group. These results emphasize the importance of targeted leadership development programs in fostering critical skills and promoting long-term knowledge retention and practical application. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Background Medical residents often struggle with complex clinical scenarios that require sophisticated decision-making skills. While case-based discussion (CBD) is widely used in medical education, its effectiveness can be limited by insufficient guidance and structured support. Scaffolding teaching, which provides graduated assistance aligned with learners’ development, may address these limitations. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating the integration of scaffolding with CBD in residency training remains limited. This study aims to compare an integrated scaffolded case-based learning approach with traditional lecture-based teaching that utilizes the same clinical case materials in enhancing residents’ clinical reasoning, self-directed learning, and knowledge acquisition in anesthesiology training. Methods This prospective randomized controlled trial encompassed 12 anesthesiology residents, systematically randomized into an experimental cohort (receiving scaffolding teaching integrated with case-based discussion) and a control cohort (receiving traditional lecture-based instruction utilizing the same clinical case). The intervention consisted of a structured 4-week curriculum focusing on HOCM anesthesia management, delivered through weekly instructional sessions. The investigation utilized validated assessment instruments to measure primary outcomes, including clinical reasoning proficiency and self-directed learning capacity, at three time points: baseline, post-intervention (Week 4), and follow-up (Week 8). Secondary outcome measures encompassed teaching satisfaction indices and knowledge retention metrics. Statistical analysis employed t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for comparative assessment. Results Post-intervention evaluation at Week 4 revealed statistically significant superiority in the experimental cohort across multiple parameters: clinical reasoning proficiency (83.58 ± 3.28 versus 74.17 ± 4.55, p  = 0.002), self-directed learning capacity (79.92 ± 2.56 versus 63.33 ± 3.52, p  < 0.001), and teaching satisfaction indices (100.00 ± 0.00 versus 73.00 ± 5.02, p  < 0.001). Follow-up assessment at Week 8 demonstrated sustained enhancement in the experimental group, maintaining significant advantages in clinical reasoning proficiency (89.08 ± 5.93 versus 68.17 ± 2.70, p  < 0.001), self-directed learning capacity (87.83 ± 2.56 versus 71.58 ± 3.50, p  < 0.001), and knowledge retention (98.33 ± 2.58 versus 95.00 ± 0.00, p  = 0.010). Conclusion This investigation demonstrates that an integrated scaffolding-supported case-based learning approach offers significant advantages over traditional lecture-based teaching that incorporates the same clinical case. The integrated approach significantly enhances clinical reasoning capabilities, self-directed learning competencies, and knowledge acquisition in complex clinical scenarios compared to the lecture-based approach. These findings establish a robust empirical foundation for the optimization of residency training methodologies, particularly within high-complexity clinical domains such as HOCM anesthesia management. The sustained improvements observed at follow-up further validate the long-term effectiveness of this integrated pedagogical approach. Clinical trial registration Not applicable. This study is an educational research project evaluating teaching methodologies through simulated training and does not involve health-related interventions or patient outcomes.

Abstract: Background Basic science knowledge is essential for understanding clinical studies and enhancing clinical reasoning in medical practice. However, medical students retain only a portion of the knowledge gained during the early years of medical school. We aimed to examine medical students’ knowledge retention of repeated and recently learned topics in physiology and microbiology with additional analysis of individual variability. Given that prior studies have raised concerns about the validity of retention rate as an indicator of stable knowledge, we also explored alternative measures of retention. Methods Nineteen third- and 22 fourth-year medical students volunteered to repeat the written examinations in physiology and microbiology, respectively, in September 2022 at the University of Pécs. Students previously completed a summative test in the fall semester and another test in the spring semester. Both examinations consisted of multiple-choice questions and the second test included questions from both semesters introducing a unique form of spaced repetition. In our study, students repeated the complete second test after a 16-week non-use retention interval. Besides retention rates, we calculated the percentage of consistently correct and incorrect answers as retention measures. Correlations between retention measures and students’ grade point averages (GPAs) were examined. Results Significant declines in test scores were observed, with physiology scores dropping from 70.4 to 53.5% and microbiology scores from 72.1 to 57.3%. Retention rates varied significantly, with values ranging from 54.5 to 97.2%. Microbiology revealed better results of first-semester content compared to the second semester in some of the retention measures, while physiology showed no difference between semesters. Retention rates did not correlate with GPA, however, the percentage of consistently correct answers showed moderate positive correlations, while the consistently incorrect answers showed moderate negative correlations with GPA. Conclusions There was a substantial knowledge loss among medical students with high individual variability indicating the need to explore factors affecting long-term knowledge retention in real-life educational settings more deeply. Previously acquired knowledge in microbiology demonstrated superior retention, potentially attributable to the beneficial effects of spaced repetition. The lack of correlation between retention rates and GPA suggests that other measures may better reflect stable knowledge.

Abstract: Background Traditional lecture-based learning has been the cornerstone of dental education; however, active learning strategies such as flipped classrooms are gaining popularity for their potential to enhance student engagement and performance. This study evaluated the effectiveness of three teaching methods—traditional live lectures, flipped video classrooms, and interactive flipped classrooms—on improving academic performance and student perceptions among fourth-year dental students. Methods This study employed a stratified randomization design involving 156 fourth-year dental students using a single lecture in an undergraduate orthodontics course. The students were first grouped into four categories based on their Grade Point Average (GPA): Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Satisfactory. From these groups, students were randomly drawn and placed into one of three intervention groups: live lecture, flipped classroom with video lectures, and flipped classroom with interactive video lectures. Pre- and post-intervention assessments evaluated knowledge improvement, while objective structured assessments measured academic performance. Student perceptions were gauged using validated Likert-scale questionnaires. Paired t-tests assessed within-group differences, and ANOVA compared effectiveness across teaching methods. Pearson’s correlation analysis examined the relationship between academic performance and GPA of the students. Results All three teaching methods showed significant improvements in post-intervention scores ( p  < 0.001). The Live Lecture Group had the greatest mean improvement (27.69), followed by the Flipped Video Lecture Group (27.30) and the Flipped Interactive Lecture Group (27.11). However, ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups ( F (2, 153) = 0.007, p  = 0.993). Female students performed better in the live lecture setting (32.60 ± 25.08) compared to males (23.79 ± 21.44). Students with lower GPAs benefited most from the interactive flipped classroom, Pearson’s correlation indicated a strong positive association between GPA and post-intervention scores ( r  = 0.708, p  < 0.001). Student satisfaction was highest in the interactive flipped classroom, with 97.7% rating the experience as “Excellent” or “Very Good.” Conclusions All three teaching methods led to significant improvement in post-test scores. While students reported higher engagement and satisfaction in flipped and interactive flipped lectures, the live lecture method was also effective for knowledge retention. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring educational strategies to diverse student needs in dental education. Educators should consider a blended model that integrates flipped and traditional strategies selectively, balancing feasibility with student needs, as developing multiple formats can be time-intensive with only modest differences in outcomes. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Abstract: Introduction: The level of knowledge about stunting among health workers remains varied. Nowadays, self-directed or asynchronous online learning has become a prominent approach in the learning process. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of self-directed online learning in improving health workers’ knowledge about stunting. Method: A total of 41 participants from 5 provinces (South Sumatera, West Java, East Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, and South Sulawesi) were purposively selected to enrol in a stunting course at the Learning Center, PDRC, Faculty of Public Health, Universitas Indonesia. The learning materials comprised 15 topics in the form of animated videos and one digital pocketbook. A paired t-test was used to evaluate changes before and after completing the course. Result: The analysis showed a significant improvement in knowledge score (p-value < 0.05), with an average increase of 21 points. However, an individual topic analysis indicated the need for further discussion to enhance participants' understanding. Conclusion: Self-directed online learning effectively improves health workers’ knowledge about stunting. Nevertheless, further studies should explore the impact of synchronous sessions in enhancing knowledge retention and comprehension.

Abstract: Peer‐assisted learning and group facilitation have been proven to foster active participation in small‐group learning, and these effective teaching modalities have been shown to enhance learning outcomes. This study introduced a student peer facilitator role in an anatomy small‐group curriculum for pre‐clerkship medical students and explored its impact on academic performance and retention. Students were required to rotate through this facilitator role and lead their small group during their designated sessions. Data collection methods included pre‐course and post‐course surveys, individual quiz grades, and retention quizzes sent 1 month after each quiz. Overall, the data revealed a significant increase in the overall combined quiz averages across the curriculum for facilitators compared to participants despite having no notable increase in preparation time ( p = 0.004). While facilitators scored significantly higher on the course quizzes, the slight increase in their average retention quiz scores was not significant. This study was unable to identify any significant benefits to retention for either facilitators or participants. In all, this study suggests that a peer facilitation paradigm can be an effective educational modality for medical students, and future studies should explore ways to improve knowledge retention through this role.

Abstract: Background Sepsis is one of the most challenging and complex clinical states, with persistently high mortality rates. Guidelines recommend the early identification of sepsis patients and immediate initiation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment to reduce mortality from sepsis. Emergency nurses play a vital role in the early screening of sepsis. Studies indicate that mind mapping and In-Situ Simulation (ISS) training not only aid healthcare professionals in reinforcing theoretical knowledge retention but also enhance skills in coordination, task management, and communication during simulation exercises. This, in turn, promotes the effective implementation of various treatments during resuscitation. The combination of theoretical and practical training methods is more effective than a single training approach. In June 2023, our hospital's emergency department conducted training for emergency nurses on sepsis mind mapping combined with ISS. Objective To explore the effect of mind mapping combined with ISS training in promoting the emergency nurses' implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle in sepsis patients. Methods Using mind mapping and ISS training methods, 24 emergency nurses were divided into 6 groups for a 12-week training period. The study compared their pre- and post-training knowledge of sepsis, identification and diagnostic time, Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rate, and non-technical skill scores. Post-training, the emergency nurses evaluated the effectiveness of the training. Results The scores for sepsis knowledge among emergency nurses before and after training were 44.17 ± 9.21 and 60.42 ± 5.29, respectively. The identification and diagnostic times (hours) were 0.63 ± 0.18 and 0.49 ± 0.13, respectively. The Hour-1 Bundle treatment completion rates were 58.33% and 85.7%, respectively. There was a significant increase in all non-technical skill scores, with statistical significance ( P  < 0.05, P  < 0.001). After two ISS trainings, the SET-M scores progressively increased, indicating a high satisfaction rate among nurses with the mind mapping and ISS training. Conclusion The combination of mind mapping and ISS training enables emergency nurses to identify sepsis earlier and promotes the effective implementation of the Hour-1 Bundle treatment in sepsis patients, while also enhancing their cognitive understanding of sepsis and non-technical skills.

Abstract: Background Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common emergency associated with significant morbidity and mortality in low resource settings. Prompt diagnosis and correct management improves outcomes. To improve clinician knowledge and confidence in DKA management, we designed a novel curriculum for training local clinicians in a low-resource setting. This curriculum aligned to international guidelines, adapted for local resources. Our aim was to assess if the curriculum improved clinician knowledge and confidence. Methods Participants included physicians and nurses in the Emergency Department (ED) at a tertiary academic center in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants completed pre/post-tests of knowledge, which permitted prospective curriculum evaluation based on the second level Kirkpatrick hierarchy, knowledge retention. The cases focused on local evidence-based DKA management pathways. They were delivered using novel in-person with virtual (recorded) teaching techniques, permitting both conventional and independent learning. Outcome measures related to knowledge improvement were analyzed using independent t -tests; clinician confidence was assessed via self-reported survey and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results 125 clinicians (79.8% nurses and 20.2% physicians) completed pre-training assessment; 104 completed post-training assessment. Prior to training, 53.6% of all trainees reported that they were “highly confident” compared with 61.5% of all trainees post-training ( p =0.16). Post-training, there were statistically significant increases in knowledge scores related to DKA diagnosis (14% increase, p =0.03), electrolyte management (41% increase, p <0.0001), fluid administration (28% increase, p =0.01) and insulin administration (24% increase, p =0.01). There was a significant increase in overall clinician knowledge scores with 34.4% ( n =43) attaining a knowledge score of 7 or above correct responses out of the 10 cases presented pre-training versus 65.4% n =68 post-training ( p <0.0001). Conclusion Our pretest-posttest results demonstrate that our DKA management course improved clinical knowledge among physicians and nurses working in low-resource ED. Future research is underway to evaluate clinical practice changes and patient care outcomes related to this improved knowledge.

Abstract: Background The flipped classroom (FC) approach has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing the learning process, including within higher education contexts such as medical education. Recently, FC has emerged as potential alternative to traditional teaching models across various disciplines, particularly due to its more engaging nature. However, there is limited data available regarding its impact on student performance, particularly in the context of long-term knowledge retention in pharmacology. In this study, our objective was to assess the short- and long-term impact of FC on student performance in Hungarian pharmacology teaching at medical faculty in Semmelweis University (Budapest, Hungary). Methods and results 161 medical students and 10 teachers were involved in this study. We flipped four seminars, then we assessed the academic performance by using multiple choice tests immediately and two weeks after the flipped class. A follow-up assessment was conducted six months after the initial two FC sessions. Our findings indicated that the FC approach enhanced both short- and long-term knowledge retention across most topics. Notably, this long-term improvement was evident even six months after the original seminars on specific subjects. However, despite these topic-specific benefits, the overall performance, including exam grades, did not show significant improvement when compared to the conventional teaching approach. Additionally, we assessed student and teacher perceptions using two questionnaires immediately after practice and at the end of the year. According to the questionnaire responses, students perceived positively the FC approach, emphasizing its interactive and thought-provoking aspects. However, they identified the time-consuming nature of preparation as a significant concern. Teachers also viewed the FC approach favorably, particularly appreciating its interactivity and potential for greater effectiveness. Interestingly, more experienced teachers were less receptive to the FC method, and their perceptions of it were less favorable compared to those of their younger colleagues. Conclusions The flipped classroom approach presents a viable strategy for teaching pharmacology, with the potential to enhance student performance and engagement. However, student occupation and faculty resistance may pose significant challenges to the implementation of such alternative teaching methods.

Abstract: Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health threat, partly driven by inappropriate antibiotic use. Healthcare students, as future practitioners, must have a good understanding of AMR to contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention on healthcare students’ knowledge of AMR and to assess patterns of antibiotic use prior to the intervention. Methods A quasi-experimental pre-and-post study design was conducted with unpaired groups of healthcare students. An educational intervention was carried out comprising of two 20-minute PowerPoint lectures, as well as question and answer sessions focused on understanding the spread, impact, and prevention of AMR. A self-administered questionnaire was given as a pre-test and repeated as a post-test immediately after the training. Students’ knowledge of AMR and patterns of antibiotic use was assessed pre-intervention while knowledge of AMR was assessed post-intervention. The knowledge was categorised into domains (Understanding Antibiotic and Antimicrobial Resistance; Spread and Impact of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance; Prevention of Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance). The total score for each domain of knowledge tested was categorized into good knowledge (≥ 80%) and poor knowledge (< 50%). Results The number of participants in the pre- and post-intervention were 185 and 157 students with average age of 17.7 years and 17.8 years respectively. Post-intervention, there was a significant increase in students’ AMR knowledge, with correct responses regarding spread and impact of AMR increasing from 40.5% pre-intervention to 62.4% post-intervention ( p  < 0.001; φ (effect size = 0.218). The proportion of students demonstrating good overall knowledge increased from 28.1 to 44.6% ( p  = 0.001; φ (effect size = 0.171). Misconceptions, such as misunderstanding that antibiotic resistance does not result from the body becoming resistant to antibiotics, persisted but not statistically significant (24.9–17.2%, p  = 0.055). Pre-intervention also revealed varied antibiotic use patterns, including the inappropriate use of antibiotics for malaria (51.7%, ( n  = 76)), and common cold (25.2% ( n  = 37)). Conclusions The study findings indicate that educational interventions can effectively improve healthcare students’ knowledge of AMR, though persistent misconceptions underscore the need for more targeted educational efforts. Incorporating structured AMR content into healthcare curricula could help the students contribute to antimicrobial stewardship. Future research should evaluate knowledge retention and behaviour changes to optimize the long-term impact of AMR education.

Abstract: Anatomy is essential for understanding healthy and disease states as well as for the successful completion of clinical clerkships and board examinations. This project provided structured workshops aimed to review anatomical concepts for clerkships and Step 1 and provided a means for medical students to assess their anatomical knowledge. We provided six optional anatomy workshops, in which students (1) took a pre-session quiz, (2) faculty reviewed key anatomy of a particular system (e.g., musculoskeletal), (3) students worked through clinical cases in small groups, and (4) students took a post-session quiz and responded to a post-session survey to rate satisfaction of session content and delivery on a five-point Likert scale. One session was excluded due to small sample size (n = 2). Results from five workshops, including brachial plexus, musculoskeletal, pelvic, gastrointestinal, and head and neck anatomy, showed that students performed significantly (p [less than or equal to] 0.05) better on the post-session quizzes compared to pre-session quizzes in all sessions. Post-session survey results indicated that students were satisfied with session content and facilitation, would attend future workshops, and would use session materials to study for Step 1. Based on these short-term benefits of the sessions, we plan to continue offering monthly workshops to medical students to increase knowledge retention of key anatomical concepts and increase preparedness for clerkships and Step 1. Future studies will longitudinally follow up with students post-Step 1 and clerkships to determine the long-term benefits of offering these workshops.

Abstract: Peer-assisted learning and group facilitation have been proven to foster active participation in small-group learning, and these effective teaching modalities have been shown to enhance learning outcomes. This study introduced a student peer facilitator role in an anatomy small-group curriculum for pre-clerkship medical students and explored its impact on academic performance and retention. Students were required to rotate through this facilitator role and lead their small group during their designated sessions. Data collection methods included pre-course and post-course surveys, individual quiz grades, and retention quizzes sent 1 month after each quiz. Overall, the data revealed a significant increase in the overall combined quiz averages across the curriculum for facilitators compared to participants despite having no notable increase in preparation time (p = 0.004). While facilitators scored significantly higher on the course quizzes, the slight increase in their average retention quiz scores was not significant. This study was unable to identify any significant benefits to retention for either facilitators or participants. In all, this study suggests that a peer facilitation paradigm can be an effective educational modality for medical students, and future studies should explore ways to improve knowledge retention through this role.

Abstract: The retention of organizational knowledge is increasingly challenging for companies giventhe aging workforce, high turnover rates, and declining birth rates. This study explores the knowledge transfer processes during generational transitions and examines how digital transformation facilitates business model innovation. Specifically, it examines theknowledge transfer procedures implemented in companies in the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, a competitive industrial region in Europe. Using a quantitative approach, 168 individuals in key leadership positions were surveyed on the mechanisms used for knowledge retention and their effectiveness. The results reveal that while companies prioritize knowledge transfer, most lack effective protocols. Organizations employing both digital and analog strategies are perceived as more efficient in retaining knowledge. Only half of the companies integrate knowledge transfer processes into their management strategies, with no observed differences in employee knowledge-sharing behaviors based on company size. This study concludes that a lack of structured procedures may harm long-term competitiveness, recommending that companies invest more in developing formal generational handover protocols. This research underscores the vital importance of knowledge retention for organizational sustainability and highlights the need for further exploration to address this issue.

Abstract: Background Educational research highlights active approaches to learning are more effective in knowledge retention and problem-solving. It has long been acknowledged that adapting to more active ways of learning form part of the challenge for new university students as the pedagogical distance between the didactical approach largely followed by secondary school systems the world over differs quite significantly from the often more student-led, critical approach taken by universities. University students encounter various learning challenges, particularly during the transition from secondary school to university. Poor adaptation and low performance in the first year of tertiary education can lead to higher failure rates and potential withdrawal from study programmes. Adopting active learning strategies early in this transition phase is crucial for supporting students’ adaptation and success. Gaining student engagement with active learning can be a significant challenge when there is an expectation to participate in a discussion or voice an opinion. Case-based learning (CBL), with its scaffolded form of learning, is an approach that could provide the support needed to help multicultural learners adapt to their new learning environment in a non-threatening classroom-based setting. The research question in this study was: what features of CBL support active learning? Methods Data was collected using Structured Group Feedback Sessions (SGFS) from 36 students from 12 different countries. Students were placed in eight Structured Group Feedback sessions, a method that facilitates structured discussions and is effect in curriculum evaluation and feedback. The Experience Based Learning model was used as the conceptual framework to guide the analysis, which was completed using the framework analysis method. Results Themes were derived from the Experience Based Learning model: affective, pedagogical, and organisational and analysed according to the research question. We found CBL can be used to facilitate active learning with all students at a multicultural medical university. We identified six learning points to highlight features of CBL that support active learning: CBL increased contact with peers and facilitated student bonding; students need to feel psychologically safe to participate; prior learning can enhance confidence to participate; facilitators need to be aware of their role, know about psychological safety, and manage student participation including the dominant voice; some students have a lower tolerance of uncertainty and need additional clarity at the end either via the facilitator or additional notes that provide the key learning points to take away; students became more engaged when a case is aligned to a real patient case giving it authenticity. Conclusions This study explores how CBL can support active learning in a multicultural medical school. We identified that CBL did facilitate active learning and students engaged with it and enjoyed it. We identified six learning points to support others going forward.

Abstract: Study Objective Student-centered learning and unconventional teaching modalities are gaining popularity in medical education. One notable approach involves engaging students in producing creative projects to complement the learning of preclinical topics. A systematic review was conducted to characterize the impact of creative project-based learning on metacognition and knowledge gains in medical students. Methods A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase via Ovid, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Scopus from January 1st, 1995, to July 6th, 2023. Studies using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods approaches that explored the impact of creative project-based lessons on medical students' educational outcomes were included. Two investigators independently screened the titles and abstracts and extracted data from included articles. A narrative synthesis was conducted to summarize study designs and outcome measures. Content analysis was conducted to generate codes and themes. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool in view of the range of study types employed. Results The review included 17 studies published between 2010 to 2022. These studies implemented various creative project interventions such as handicraft models, drawings, and concept maps covering multiple topics, including anatomy, histopathology, and fundamental sciences. The identified themes of Enhanced Learning, Collaborative Learning, and Deep Learning led to further themes of Student Engagement, Student Disengagement, and Faculty Engagement. Collaborative learning involves students working in teams and benefitting from effective mentorship. Creative projects facilitated deep learning objectives via interdisciplinary learning and promoted new ways of perceiving concepts. Learning was enhanced through increased interactivity, high conceptual fidelity and improved knowledge retention. Conclusion Creative projects undertaken by medical students exhibit attributes that facilitate the acquisition of collaborative and deep learning objectives through self-directed learning, cognitive load modulation, and metacognitive behaviours. Faculty mentorship and group learning amongst peers facilitate these processes, although challenges such as high task demands, cognitive and emotional intensiveness, and mismatch with students; professional identities remain. Overall, students and faculty received these interventions well, thus, warranting further exploration for uses in medical curricula. Trial registration Not applicable as this study is a systematic review.

Abstract: Background The rapid evolution of healthcare necessitates a new generation of doctors with strong critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills. This systematic review explores current longitudinal assessment practices in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia with particular emphasis on progress test and its utility, advantages, and disadvantages. Methods A systematic search was conducted across relevant databases to identify studies that discuss progress test in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The studies were analyzed to evaluate their alignment with study objectives and to the demands of a changing healthcare landscape. Results The review highlights the dynamic nature of progress test (PT) as a longitudinal assessment method in undergraduate medical education in Saudi Arabia. The advantages included yearly assessments and holistic feedback to enhance learning techniques and knowledge retention. Moreover, PT serves as both a summative and formative assessment, offering personalized learning experiences tailored to individual needs and pacing. Contrasting traditional assessments, PT promotes deep learning strategies and meaning-oriented approaches, fostering holistic understanding rather than rote memorization. Additionally, PT’s continuous nature allows for early identification of knowledge gaps and facilitates ongoing improvement. Conclusion This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of progress test as a longitudinal assessment method in undergraduate medical education. It identifies areas for improvement and informs the development of more effective assessment methods that better prepare future doctors for a future of innovation and personalized medicine.

Abstract: This study aims to examine the combination of educational data mining and learning analytics with virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and the metaverse, its role in education, and its impact on teaching and learning. Therefore, a systematic literature review, a bibliometric and scientific mapping analysis, and a content analysis are carried out based on 70 relevant documents identified from six databases, namely, ACM, ERIC, IEEE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) following the PRISMA framework. The documents were separated into the following three categories, (i) Theoretical and Review studies, (ii) Proposal and Showcase studies, and (iii) Experimental and Case studies and were examined from different dimensions through an in-depth content analysis using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The documents were further analyzed using scientometric tools, such as Bibliometrix and VOSviewer and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The most prominent topics, areas, and themes were revealed and the outcomes regarding the influence of this combination on learning and teaching were summarized. Based on the results, this combination can effectively enrich education, positively affect learning and teaching, offer deep and meaningful learning, and support both students and teachers. Additionally, it can support different educational approaches and strategies, various learning styles, and special education and be utilized in both formal and informal learning environments. The real-time identification, tracking, monitoring, analysis, and visualization of multimodal learning data of students’ behavior, emotions, cognitive and affective states and the overall learning and teaching processes emerged as a significant benefit that contributes greatly to the realization of adaptive and personalized learning. Finally, it was revealed that the combination of extended reality technologies with learning analytics and educational data mining can support collaborative learning and social learning, improve students’ self-efficacy and self-regulated learning, and increase students’ learning gains, academic achievements, knowledge retention, motivation, and engagement.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus worldwide necessitates that medical undergraduates acquire a deep understanding of the disease to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective management. Traditional teaching methods, while foundational, often lack the interactive elements that enhance student engagement and knowledge retention. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel educational board game, “Diabe-teach,” in enhancing knowledge retention among medical students compared with conventional self-study methods. A randomized controlled design involving 56 preclinical medical students at Dubai Medical College for Girls was used. The participants were randomly assigned to either the game-based learning group or the control group, with both groups receiving identical instructional materials on diabetes. Knowledge retention was assessed via pre- and post-test scores, whereas student engagement and perceptions were measured via a feedback survey. The results indicated that while both groups showed significant improvement in post-test scores ( p  < .001), the game-based group demonstrated a notably greater frequency of correct responses and a greater tendency to recognize knowledge gaps, as evidenced by the increased “I do not know” responses compared with incorrect guesses in the control group. Feedback from the game-based learning group highlighted enhanced confidence, improved communication skills, and a preference for the gamified approach over traditional methods. The findings suggest that the “Diabe-teach” board game is an effective tool for teaching complex medical concepts, fostering both knowledge retention and critical self-assessment among students. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on game-based learning, supporting its potential as a valuable adjunct to traditional medical education methods. Further research could explore the application of this approach across other medical disciplines.

Abstract: Anatomy is essential for understanding healthy and disease states as well as for the successful completion of clinical clerkships and board examinations. This project provided structured workshops aimed to review anatomical concepts for clerkships and Step 1 and provided a means for medical students to assess their anatomical knowledge. We provided six optional anatomy workshops, in which students (1) took a pre‐session quiz, (2) faculty reviewed key anatomy of a particular system (e.g., musculoskeletal), (3) students worked through clinical cases in small groups, and (4) students took a post‐session quiz and responded to a post‐session survey to rate satisfaction of session content and delivery on a five‐point Likert scale. One session was excluded due to small sample size ( n  = 2). Results from five workshops, including brachial plexus, musculoskeletal, pelvic, gastrointestinal, and head and neck anatomy, showed that students performed significantly ( p  ≤ 0.05) better on the post‐session quizzes compared to pre‐session quizzes in all sessions. Post‐session survey results indicated that students were satisfied with session content and facilitation, would attend future workshops, and would use session materials to study for Step 1. Based on these short‐term benefits of the sessions, we plan to continue offering monthly workshops to medical students to increase knowledge retention of key anatomical concepts and increase preparedness for clerkships and Step 1. Future studies will longitudinally follow up with students post‐Step 1 and clerkships to determine the long‐term benefits of offering these workshops.

Abstract: Peer‐assisted learning and group facilitation have been proven to foster active participation in small‐group learning, and these effective teaching modalities have been shown to enhance learning outcomes. This study introduced a student peer facilitator role in an anatomy small‐group curriculum for pre‐clerkship medical students and explored its impact on academic performance and retention. Students were required to rotate through this facilitator role and lead their small group during their designated sessions. Data collection methods included pre‐course and post‐course surveys, individual quiz grades, and retention quizzes sent 1 month after each quiz. Overall, the data revealed a significant increase in the overall combined quiz averages across the curriculum for facilitators compared to participants despite having no notable increase in preparation time ( p  = 0.004). While facilitators scored significantly higher on the course quizzes, the slight increase in their average retention quiz scores was not significant. This study was unable to identify any significant benefits to retention for either facilitators or participants. In all, this study suggests that a peer facilitation paradigm can be an effective educational modality for medical students, and future studies should explore ways to improve knowledge retention through this role.

Abstract: Peer-assisted learning and group facilitation have been proven to foster active participation in small-group learning, and these effective teaching modalities have been shown to enhance learning outcomes. This study introduced a student peer facilitator role in an anatomy small-group curriculum for pre-clerkship medical students and explored its impact on academic performance and retention. Students were required to rotate through this facilitator role and lead their small group during their designated sessions. Data collection methods included pre-course and post-course surveys, individual quiz grades, and retention quizzes sent 1 month after each quiz. Overall, the data revealed a significant increase in the overall combined quiz averages across the curriculum for facilitators compared to participants despite having no notable increase in preparation time (p = 0.004). While facilitators scored significantly higher on the course quizzes, the slight increase in their average retention quiz scores was not significant. This study was unable to identify any significant benefits to retention for either facilitators or participants. In all, this study suggests that a peer facilitation paradigm can be an effective educational modality for medical students, and future studies should explore ways to improve knowledge retention through this role.Peer-assisted learning and group facilitation have been proven to foster active participation in small-group learning, and these effective teaching modalities have been shown to enhance learning outcomes.

Abstract: Spaced repetition is superior to repeated study for learning and knowledge retention, but literature on the effect of different spaced repetition strategies is lacking. The authors evaluated the effects of different spaced repetition strategies on long-term knowledge retention and transfer. PURPOSE Spaced repetition is superior to repeated study for learning and knowledge retention, but literature on the effect of different spaced repetition strategies is lacking. The authors evaluated the effects of different spaced repetition strategies on long-term knowledge retention and transfer.This prospective cohort study, conducted from October 1, 2020, to July 20, 2023, used the American Board of Family Medicine Continuous Knowledge Self-Assessment (CKSA) to assess learning and knowledge transfer of diplomates and residents. Participants were randomized to a control group or 1 of 5 spaced repetition conditions during 5 calendar quarters (January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022). Participants in the spaced repetition groups received 6 repeated questions once or twice. Incorrectly but confidently answered questions were prioritized for repetition, with decreasing priority for questions answered incorrectly with lesser confidence. All participants received 6 rewritten questions corresponding to their initial questions chosen for repetition in quarter 10 (second quarter of calendar year 2023). METHOD This prospective cohort study, conducted from October 1, 2020, to July 20, 2023, used the American Board of Family Medicine Continuous Knowledge Self-Assessment (CKSA) to assess learning and knowledge transfer of diplomates and residents. Participants were randomized to a control group or 1 of 5 spaced repetition conditions during 5 calendar quarters (January 1, 2021, to March 31, 2022). Participants in the spaced repetition groups received 6 repeated questions once or twice. Incorrectly but confidently answered questions were prioritized for repetition, with decreasing priority for questions answered incorrectly with lesser confidence. All participants received 6 rewritten questions corresponding to their initial questions chosen for repetition in quarter 10 (second quarter of calendar year 2023).A total of 26,258 family physicians or residents who completed the CKSA in the baseline period were randomized. Spaced repetition was superior to no spaced repetition for learning at quarter 6 (58.03% vs 43.20%, P < .001, Cohen d = 0.62) and knowledge transfer at quarter 10 (58.33% vs 52.39%, P < .001, Cohen d = 0.26). Double-spaced repetitions were superior to single-spaced repetitions for learning (62.24% vs 51.83%, P < .001, Cohen d = 0.43) and transfer (60.08% vs 55.72%, P < .001, Cohen d = 0.20). There were no meaningful differences in learning or transfer between repetition strategy chosen in the single- or double-repetition groups. RESULTS A total of 26,258 family physicians or residents who completed the CKSA in the baseline period were randomized. Spaced repetition was superior to no spaced repetition for learning at quarter 6 (58.03% vs 43.20%, P < .001, Cohen d = 0.62) and knowledge transfer at quarter 10 (58.33% vs 52.39%, P < .001, Cohen d = 0.26).

There were no meaningful differences in learning or transfer between repetition strategy chosen in the single- or double-repetition groups.This study affirms the value of spaced repetition in improving learning and retention in medical education and ongoing professional development. CONCLUSIONS This study affirms the value of spaced repetition in improving learning and retention in medical education and ongoing professional development.

Abstract: Retrieval practice is a highly effective learning strategy that enhances long-term retention by encouraging the active recall of information. However, the optimal question format for maximizing knowledge retention remains uncertain. In this study, we compared the effect of very short answer (VSAQ) versus multiple-choice question (MCQ) practice tests on students' knowledge retention. By analyzing these two formats, we aim to identify the most effective approach to retrieval practice, thereby helping to optimize its implementation and improve learning outcomes. BACKGROUND Retrieval practice is a highly effective learning strategy that enhances long-term retention by encouraging the active recall of information. However, the optimal question format for maximizing knowledge retention remains uncertain. In this study, we compared the effect of very short answer (VSAQ) versus multiple-choice question (MCQ) practice tests on students' knowledge retention. By analyzing these two formats, we aim to identify the most effective approach to retrieval practice, thereby helping to optimize its implementation and improve learning outcomes.In this randomized within-subjects study, students (n = 45) practiced with both VSAQs and MCQs in an extracurricular lifestyle course, without receiving feedback. The final retention test consisted of identical questions in both formats. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of question format in practice testing and final test on final test score. Additionally, digital questionnaires were used to explore students' test-taking experiences. METHODS In this randomized within-subjects study, students (n = 45) practiced with both VSAQs and MCQs in an extracurricular lifestyle course, without receiving feedback. The final retention test consisted of identical questions in both formats. A 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA was used to determine the effect of question format in practice testing and final test on final test score. Additionally, digital questionnaires were used to explore students' test-taking experiences.The VSAQs were answered incorrectly more frequently on the practice tests and final test. There was no main effect of practice question format on final test performance, and no interaction effect between question format on the practice and final test. Regardless of question format, most students thought the practice tests were beneficial for learning. RESULTS The VSAQs were answered incorrectly more frequently on the practice tests and final test. There was no main effect of practice question format on final test performance, and no interaction effect between question format on the practice and final test. Regardless of question format, most students thought the practice tests were beneficial for learning.We found no evidence indicating that either MCQ or VSAQ is more effective for knowledge retention during retrieval practice. The lower initial retrieval success in the VSAQs, indicated by the higher degree of incorrect answers on the practice tests, might have limited their effectiveness during retrieval practice. To optimize the use of VSAQs in retrieval practice, it seems important to improve initial retrieval success to maximize learning outcomes. CONCLUSIONS We found no evidence indicating that either MCQ or VSAQ is more effective for knowledge retention during retrieval practice. The lower initial retrieval success in the VSAQs, indicated by the higher degree of incorrect answers on the practice tests, might have limited their effectiveness during retrieval practice.

Abstract: Biochemistry is a cornerstone of medical education. Its knowledge is integral to the understanding of complex biological processes and how they are applied in several areas in health care. Also, its significance is reflected in the way it informs the practice of medicine, which can guide and help in both diagnosis and treatment. However, the retention of biochemistry knowledge over time remains a dilemma. Long-term retention of such crucial information is extremely important, as it forms the foundation upon which clinical skills are developed and refined. The effectiveness of biochemistry education, and consequently its long-term retention, is influenced by several factors. Educational methods play a critical role; interactional and integrative teaching approaches have been suggested to enhance retention compared with traditional didactic methods. The frequency and context in which biochemistry knowledge is applied in clinical settings can significantly impact its retention. Practical application reinforces theoretical understanding, making the knowledge more accessible in the long term. Prior knowledge (familiarity) of information suggests that it is stored in long-term memory, which makes its retention in the long term easier to recall.

The aim of the study is to understand the dynamics of long-term retention of biochemistry among medical students. Specifically, it looks for the association between students' familiarity with biochemistry content and actual knowledge retention levels.A cross-sectional correlational survey involving 240 students from King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences was conducted. Participants were recruited via nonprobability convenience sampling. A validated biochemistry assessment tool with 20 questions was used to gauge students' retention in biomolecules, catalysis, bioenergetics, and metabolism. To assess students' familiarity with the knowledge content of test questions, each question is accompanied by options that indicate students' prior knowledge of the content of the question. Statistical analyses tests such as Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-square tests were used.

A validated biochemistry assessment tool with 20 questions was used to gauge students' retention in biomolecules, catalysis, bioenergetics, and metabolism. To assess students' familiarity with the knowledge content of test questions, each question is accompanied by options that indicate students' prior knowledge of the content of the question. Statistical analyses tests such as Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-square tests were used.Our findings revealed a significant correlation between students' familiarity of the content with their knowledge retention in the biomolecules (r=0.491; P<.001), catalysis (r=0.500; P<.001), bioenergetics (r=0.528; P<.001), and metabolism (r=0.564; P<.001) biochemistry knowledge domains. Results Our findings revealed a significant correlation between students' familiarity of the content with their knowledge retention in the biomolecules (r=0.491; P<.001), catalysis (r=0.500; P<.001), bioenergetics (r=0.528; P<.001), and metabolism (r=0.564; P<.001) biochemistry knowledge domains.This study highlights the significance of familiarity (prior knowledge) in evaluating the retention of biochemistry knowledge. Although limited in terms of generalizability and inherent biases, the research highlights the crucial significance of student's familiarity in actual knowledge retention of several biochemistry domains. These results might be used by educators to customize instructional methods in order to improve students' long-term retention of biochemistry information and boost their clinical performance. Conclusions This study highlights the significance of familiarity (prior knowledge) in evaluating the retention of biochemistry knowledge. Although limited in terms of generalizability and inherent biases, the research highlights the crucial significance of student's familiarity in actual knowledge retention of several biochemistry domains. These results might be used by educators to customize instructional methods in order to improve students' long-term retention of biochemistry information and boost their clinical performance.

Abstract: Learning in undergraduate immunology requires students to be able to retain knowledge, to apply information to new contexts, and to self-assess their understanding of concepts. These core competencies strengthen students' critical thinking and metacognitive skills which, in turn, enhances their ability to identify knowledge gaps and strategies to support future learning. Retrieval practice and feedback-driven metacognition are evidence-based teaching strategies that have been demonstrated to enhance knowledge retention and metacognition in a range of academic disciplines and levels of education, although their implementation and impact on learning in undergraduate immunology remain largely unexplored. To this end, I designed a modular "practice session" activity for a 12-week, upper-level, undergraduate immunology course that incorporates periodic retrieval practice and feedback-driven metacognition to support students' knowledge retention, application of information, and metacognitive skills. Near the end of the course, a survey was conducted to assess student perceptions on whether the activity supported learning and metacognition in immunology. Instructional resources are provided to facilitate easy adaptation of this modular activity to courses of diverse science disciplines and levels of study in higher education.Learning in undergraduate immunology requires students to be able to retain knowledge, to apply information to new contexts, and to self-assess their understanding of concepts.

Abstract: Maintaining good oral hygiene through effective toothbrushing is crucial for preventing dental issues in adolescents. Conventional oral health education (OHE) and video demonstration approach are passive means of OHE, that often fail to engage this age group. This study introduced an innovative approach to OHE by combining jigsaw puzzle and visual aids to improve oral health outcomes among adolescents. BACKGROUND Maintaining good oral hygiene through effective toothbrushing is crucial for preventing dental issues in adolescents. Conventional oral health education (OHE) and video demonstration approach are passive means of OHE, that often fail to engage this age group. This study introduced an innovative approach to OHE by combining jigsaw puzzle and visual aids to improve oral health outcomes among adolescents.To assess the effectiveness of Jigsaw Puzzle-assisted Visual Reinforcement (JPVR) technique on toothbrushing knowledge, practices, and clinical oral health parameters compared to conventional OHE and video demonstration among adolescents. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of Jigsaw Puzzle-assisted Visual Reinforcement (JPVR) technique on toothbrushing knowledge, practices, and clinical oral health parameters compared to conventional OHE and video demonstration among adolescents.This single-blind randomized controlled trial involved 195 adolescents aged 12-15 years randomly allocated to three groups: conventional OHE (control), video demonstration and JPVR. Interventions were administered, and assessments were carried out at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Prior to the start of the study, the oral hygiene aids used were standardized. Outcomes were measured using a self-designed, validated closed-ended questionnaire to assess the toothbrushing knowledge and practices. This was followed by clinical examination carried out using gingival and plaque indices by a blinded examiner. MATERIAL AND METHODS This single-blind randomized controlled trial involved 195 adolescents aged 12-15 years randomly allocated to three groups: conventional OHE (control), video demonstration and JPVR. Interventions were administered, and assessments were carried out at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Prior to the start of the study, the oral hygiene aids used were standardized. Outcomes were measured using a self-designed, validated closed-ended questionnaire to assess the toothbrushing knowledge and practices. This was followed by clinical examination carried out using gingival and plaque indices by a blinded examiner.At baseline, groups had comparable knowledge, practices, and clinical parameters. At 3 months, the JPVR group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge, better practices, lower plaque, and reduced gingival scores compared to other groups. RESULTS At baseline, groups had comparable knowledge, practices, and clinical parameters. At 3 months, the JPVR group demonstrated significantly higher knowledge, better practices, lower plaque, and reduced gingival scores compared to other groups.The JPVR technique improved toothbrushing knowledge, practices, and clinical oral health parameters among adolescents. This approach fostered active learning and knowledge retention and is a cost-effective strategy for promoting positive oral health outcomes among children. CONCLUSIONS The JPVR technique improved toothbrushing knowledge, practices, and clinical oral health parameters among adolescents. This approach fostered active learning and knowledge retention and is a cost-effective strategy for promoting positive oral health outcomes among children.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of medical education, gamification has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance clinical reasoning skills among healthcare professionals. By incorporating game-like elements into the learning environment, gamification strives to enhance engagement, motivation and knowledge retention. Given the importance of clinical reasoning in medical decision-making and patient care, this scoping review protocol aims to systematically explore developments, implementations and outcomes of gamification in clinical reasoning education. INTRODUCTION In the rapidly evolving field of medical education, gamification has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance clinical reasoning skills among healthcare professionals. By incorporating game-like elements into the learning environment, gamification strives to enhance engagement, motivation and knowledge retention. Given the importance of clinical reasoning in medical decision-making and patient care, this scoping review protocol aims to systematically explore developments, implementations and outcomes of gamification in clinical reasoning education.The scoping review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley methodological framework, enhanced by guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. We will search four major databases: OVID Medline, Scopus and Web of Science using key terms such as "gamification," "clinical reasoning," and "medical education". Studies will be selected based on the participants, concepts and contexts (PCC) framework, focusing on literature published in English. Two independent reviewers will screen studies and extract data on gamification elements used in clinical reasoning education. Any disagreement between the reviewers will be resolved by consulting a third person. We will provide a narrative synthesis of the findings, highlighting the variety of gamified strategies and their effects on clinical reasoning skills. This review will also map out gaps in the current literature and provide direction for future research.

Abstract: Purpose To evaluate the impact of cadaver dissection in a general surgery (GS) curriculum on the retention of anatomical knowledge (AK) at 6 months. Methods As an integral component of a general surgery resident curriculum for three consecutive years, residents dissected a fresh, non-fixed cadaver for a total of approximately 8 h over 2 days in groups of 6–7 residents with one faculty physician facilitating each dissection group. A pre-test, post-test, and 6-months post-test containing 25 anatomic knowledge questions were administered assessing basic procedural topics and emphasizing head and neck, abdominal, thoracic, extremity, and inguinal anatomy. Results A total of 30 residents completed all three tests. Pre-test and post-test scores increased from 66.1 to 75.9% (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant change from immediate post-test scores to 6-months post-test scores (p < 0.071). Conclusion Anatomical knowledge is a primary competency of general surgery residency. Cadaver dissection is a tool often used to facilitate the learning of anatomy; however, the availability of cadavers for dissection is often limited by costs, faculty teaching time required for the dissection, and required specialized cadaver dissection facilities. Despite such limitations, cadaver dissection is routinely used with our study demonstrating anatomic knowledge retention at 6 months after an 8-h session of guided cadaver dissection.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of gamification within nursing eLearning modules at the College of Nursing and Health Sciences at a university in the southern United States. Recognizing engagement and retention challenges in online instruction, this study investigates gamification as a tool to enhance student engagement and practical skill development in remote learning environments. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examines the impact of gamified elements on student engagement, learning outcomes, and knowledge retention. Contrary to expectations, the findings show that although gamification can significantly enhance the eLearning experience, intrinsic or extrinsic motivation does not directly affect engagement or the overall effectiveness of gamified elements. This paper suggests a need for tailored gamification strategies to maximize its benefits across diverse student populations.

Abstract: Introduction: Clinical reasoning is one of the vital skills in medical education that enables doctors to make correct and timely decisions about diagnosis and treatment by analyzing the patient carefully. Due to the complexity and importance of this skill, there has always been interest in developing new educational methods to improve and strengthen it have always been of interest. One of these new methods is gamification, which in recent years has been recognized as an educational tool in various fields, including medical education. In this study, we examined the use of gamification and its positive and negative multifaceted effects in teaching clinical reasoning to medical students. Search Strategy: For the systematic search of articles, first, keywords and phrases, synonyms and alternative keywords for gamification, game elements and features, clinical reasoning, and medical education were identified using thematic and lexical searches in MESH and Emtree. Based on these keywords, a list of 33 elements was compiled, utilizing the search strategy from the past five years in CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, Collection of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, PsychINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. A total of 795 articles were initially identified, of which 367 articles remained after removing duplicates. Only articles that investigated gamification in the context of clinical reasoning through intervention were included, while those that explored other contexts or targeted population outside of medical students were excluded. Two individuals independently validated the remaining articles using the CONSORT checklist. Results: Overall, 41 studies were included in the review after validation and qualitatively assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Research showed that gamification can help improve clinical skills by 20-30%, increase motivation and self-confidence by 15-20%, and increase team participation by 10%. Students trained with this method achieved better performance in clinical evaluations and an increase of 10-35% in clinical evaluation scores. Despite the apparent benefits, this educational approach led to disappointing outcomes, including a failure to maintain long-term knowledge, issues with fake attendance, the potential for fatigue, the emergence of unhealthy competition, a diminished focus on content, the risk of addiction, and privacy violations. Conclusion and Discussion: Many published works in medical education mainly focus on participants' engagement and satisfaction and changes in knowledge scores from pre-tests to post-tests. However, they often overlook advanced learning objectives, such as long-term knowledge retention and behavior change. More multicenter studies should assess participants’ behaviors, the influence of environmental and individual factors, and the cost-effectiveness of gamification within the healthcare system to evaluate educational effectiveness at levels three and four of the Kirkpatrick model.

Aging Moderns: Art, Literature, and the Experiment of Later Life by Scott Herring (review)

Abstract: Importantly, Herring terms these modernists artists or moderns instead of authors because their work extends past literature to include activism and fine art. By positioning Barnes as the first case study in his book, Herring begins widening the conversation surrounding modernism by highlighting an artist who stopped publishing after her initial successes but did not stop creating. Though these chapters initially seem out of place, Herring connects them to other moderns through their fight against gerontophobia, making them rich additions to his argument by identifying modernist trends in other forms of art. Olsen championed the life review form, which allowed her to "integrate the individual's consciousness across the lifespan" (119) in her old age to prevent generational amnesia, or the loss of knowledge about adverse circumstances of previous generations.

Abstract: Anatomy is the cornerstone of medical education. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies are becoming increasingly popular in the development of anatomy education. Various studies have evaluated VR and AR in anatomy education. This meta‐analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of VR and AR in anatomical education. The protocol was registered in Prospero. Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. From the 4487 articles gathered, 24 randomized controlled trials were finally selected according to inclusion criteria. According to the results of the meta‐analysis, VR had a moderate and significant effect on the improvement of knowledge scores in comparison with other methods (standardized mean difference = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.95; p < 0.01). Due to the high degree of heterogeneity ( I ² = 87.44%), subgroup analyses and meta‐regression were performed on eight variables. In enhancing the “attitude,” VR was found to be more “useful” than other methods ( p = 0.01); however, no significant difference was found for “enjoyable” and “easy to use” statements. Compared with other methods, the effect of AR on knowledge scores was non‐significant (SMD = −0.02; 95% CI = −0.39, 0.34; p = 0.90); also, in subgroup analyses and meta‐regression, the results were non‐significant. The results indicate that, unlike AR, VR could be used as an effective tool for teaching anatomy in medical education. Given the observed heterogeneity across the included studies, further research is warranted to identify those variables that may impact the efficacy of VR and AR in anatomy education.

Abstract: Unlike other medical specialties, surgery is primarily learned through apprenticeship, by observing surgeons in action during operations. However, the increasing number of medical students and work-hour restrictions limit opportunities for learning in the operating room (OR). These circumstances call for novel technologies, such as immersive video. The objective of this study is to compare knowledge retention, preparedness, and content engagement for surgical learning when watching a surgical video in 3D through a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) versus in 2D video on a conventional screen. BACKGROUND Unlike other medical specialties, surgery is primarily learned through apprenticeship, by observing surgeons in action during operations. However, the increasing number of medical students and work-hour restrictions limit opportunities for learning in the operating room (OR). These circumstances call for novel technologies, such as immersive video. The objective of this study is to compare knowledge retention, preparedness, and content engagement for surgical learning when watching a surgical video in 3D through a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) versus in 2D video on a conventional screen.This randomized controlled trial includes 231 fourth-year medical students. Participants watched the same 12 min surgical video, narrated by an expert, presented either in immersive 3D form through an HMD, or in 2D form through a conventional screen. The students completed three questionnaires (previewing, postviewing, and 1 month later), which included questions on knowledge retention, expected preparedness, content engagement, tool engagement, and self-assessment. Statistical analyses were adjusted by including the confounding factors. MATERIEL AND METHODS This randomized controlled trial includes 231 fourth-year medical students. Participants watched the same 12 min surgical video, narrated by an expert, presented either in immersive 3D form through an HMD, or in 2D form through a conventional screen. The students completed three questionnaires (previewing, postviewing, and 1 month later), which included questions on knowledge retention, expected preparedness, content engagement, tool engagement, and self-assessment. Statistical analyses were adjusted by including the confounding factors.Immediately after the video, the 3D immersive video group showed a significantly lower knowledge retention score compared to the classic video group (P<0.01). Nonetheless, the 3D immersive video group demonstrated better-expected preparedness as a future resident (P=0.019), greater satisfaction (P=0.033), better stimulation (P<0.001), higher involvement (P<0.001), and a greater perceived ability to identify anatomical structures (P<0.001). After 1 month, participants in the immersive video group reported feeling more prepared (P=0.016), more self-confident (P=0.020), more at ease (P=0.023), and less overwhelmed (P<0.01) than those in the 2D video group. RESULTS Immediately after the video, the 3D immersive video group showed a significantly lower knowledge retention score compared to the classic video group (P<0.01). Nonetheless, the 3D immersive video group demonstrated better-expected preparedness as a future resident (P=0.019), greater satisfaction (P=0.033), better stimulation (P<0.001), higher involvement (P<0.001), and a greater perceived ability to identify anatomical structures (P<0.001). After 1 month, participants in the immersive video group reported feeling more prepared (P=0.016), more self-confident (P=0.020), more at ease (P=0.023), and less overwhelmed (P<0.01) than those in the 2D video group.Our results showed that 3D surgical immersive video vs. 2D surgical video, enhances the sense of stimulation, satisfaction, involvement, and the perception of having better identified anatomical structures. For early medical school students where access to the OR is limited, this tool appears to a significant step forward in surgical pedagogy. However, the precise understanding of its pedagogical value required further investigation and refinement. CONCLUSION Our results showed that 3D surgical immersive video vs. 2D surgical video, enhances the sense of stimulation, satisfaction, involvement, and the perception of having better identified anatomical structures.

Abstract: ENG English ENG European smelt, Osmeras eperlanus L., was popular as food in central Sweden a century ago. During spring spawning, this fish could easily be caught in large quantities in rivers and streams with nets and wooden traps. While it is still appreciated as a delicious spring primer in several countries around the Baltic Sea, in Sweden its consumption is negligible. The fish has vanished from markets and restaurant menus, and it is fished only locally in Central Sweden. In Stockholm, smelt was fished commercially until 2016. Smelt is a small fish yet loaded with cultural symbolism, and it has attracted the attention of authors, designers, and visual artists for centuries. Attempts to relaunch smelt as a local speciality have had only marginal impact. It is far from endangered in Swedish waters, but as human food, this fish has gone from highly popular to neglected and ultimately ignored. This article discusses the significance of smelt as food and cultural symbol in historical times, causes and consequences of changing habits, and their influence on the consumption of smelt, the loss of knowledge regarding fish preparation, and the place of fish today in Swedish food traditions versus modern food preferences.

Investigating the effect of guided inquiry on learners with different prior knowledge in immersive virtual environments

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/investigating-effect-guided-inquiry-on-learners/docview/3146637113/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This study utilizes a comparative experimental research method to investigate the effect of the Predict, Observe, Explain, and Evaluate (POEE) learning strategy in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) on two types of learners with different levels of prior knowledge. One type referred to as Highly Experienced and Knowledgeable (HEK) learners, has both experience in using IVE and subject background knowledge, while the other type, referred to as Limited Experience or Knowledge (LEK) learners, lacks experience in using IVE or subject background knowledge. A total of 65 seventh-grade students from a middle school in Wuhan participated in the experiment, engaging in self-directed learning activities in the IVE. The research results indicate that the implementation of the POEE learning strategy enhances learner-content (L-C) interactions, leading to improved learning outcomes in self-directed learning in the IVE. These improvements are particularly evident in the following aspects: (1) improve LEK learners’ academic performance and promote knowledge retention and transfer; (2) improve learners’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective engagement; (3) increase learners’ motivation and self-efficacy, and decrease their cognitive load. Findings from this study contribute to a better understanding the nature and diversity in student interactions and offer valuable insights for the design of self-directed learning in an IVE.

Abstract: Aim This study aimed to explore the strategies and important components that can be implemented to build adolescent awareness about stunting prevention. Methods This study used descriptive qualitative design. The data were collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and semi-structured interviews. Purposive sampling method was employed to select the participants. The FGDs involved adolescents (n = 6) and high school counselling teachers (n = 5), while the semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts frequently involved in overcoming stunting problems in Indonesia (n = 7). The interview results were transcribed in verbatim transcription and analysed by using thematic analysis. Results Five themes were identified from the results: 1) Adolescent identity development with three sub-themes: online identity exploration, rebellious stage, and peer influence; 2) Creative and visually appealing website with six sub-themes: interesting appearance, short time span, serial content, story pattern, scenario using adolescent idol’s name, and attractive website menu; 3) Nutritional needs for adolescents with three sub-themes: iron and calcium intake, less sugar consumption, and nutritional status; 4) Engaging content for adolescents with seven sub-themes: stunting, reproductive health, anaemia, diet, wellness, early marriage, and physical activity; and 5) Effective communication strategy with two sub-themes: consistency of activities and communicative. Implications In designing adolescent stunting prevention interventions, multidisciplinary programs utilizing engaging digital health modules and grassroots partnerships should be developed and tested. These programs aim to enhance knowledge retention among youth through appealing online content and interactive community activities. Rigorous evaluation of biopsychosocial approaches can establish integrated best practices across individual, social and policy dimensions for reducing stunting.

Abstract: An association between spatial ability, particularly visualisation, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has been repeatedly demonstrated over the past four decades. Understanding this relationship is of critical importance as substantial evidence illustrates the malleability of spatial ability and that the effects of associated training interventions transfer to desirable STEM outcomes such as improved educational performance and reduced attrition rates. There currently exists a number of theories as to why spatial ability relates to STEM, such as that the nature of STEM activity is inherently spatial. However, there is a need to better understand this relationship from a cognitive perspective. This research examined the hypothesis that spatial ability is predictive of short-term retention for declarative technical information associated with engineering curricula. An original investigation in an authentic educational setting found that visualisation and interest in the lecture material were significant predictors of short-term knowledge retention. This effect was then replicated in two subsequent conceptual replication studies. Based on this predictive finding, it is theorised that increases in spatial ability may support the elongation of the knowledge forgetting curve which would have significant implications for instructional design.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, the use of Metaverse-enhanced simulations in medical education has witnessed significant advancement. These simulations offer immersive environments and technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence that have the potential to revolutionize medical training by providing realistic, hands-on experiences in diagnosing and treating patients, practicing surgical procedures, and enhancing clinical decision-making skills. This scoping review aimed to examine the evolution of simulation technology and the emergence of metaverse applications in medical professionals' training, guided by Friedman's three dimensions in medical education: physical space, time, and content, along with an additional dimension of assessment. BACKGROUND Over the past two decades, the use of Metaverse-enhanced simulations in medical education has witnessed significant advancement. These simulations offer immersive environments and technologies, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence that have the potential to revolutionize medical training by providing realistic, hands-on experiences in diagnosing and treating patients, practicing surgical procedures, and enhancing clinical decision-making skills. This scoping review aimed to examine the evolution of simulation technology and the emergence of metaverse applications in medical professionals' training, guided by Friedman's three dimensions in medical education: physical space, time, and content, along with an additional dimension of assessment.In this scoping review, we examined the related literature in six major databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. A total of 173 publications were selected for the final review and analysis. We thematically analyzed these studies by combining Friedman's three-dimensional framework with assessment. METHODS In this scoping review, we examined the related literature in six major databases including PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. A total of 173 publications were selected for the final review and analysis. We thematically analyzed these studies by combining Friedman's three-dimensional framework with assessment.Our scoping review showed that Metaverse technologies, such as virtual reality simulation and online learning modules have enabled medical education to extend beyond physical classrooms and clinical sites by facilitating remote training. In terms of the Time dimension, simulation technologies have made partial but meaningful progress in supplementing traditional time-dependent curricula, helping to shorten learning curves, and improve knowledge retention. As for the Content dimension, high-quality simulation and metaverse content require alignment with learning objectives, interactivity, and deliberate practice that should be developmentally integrated from basic to advanced skills. With respect to the Assessment dimension, learning analytics and automated metrics from metaverse-enabled simulation systems have enhanced competency evaluation and formative feedback mechanisms. However, their integration into high-stakes testing is limited, and qualitative feedback and human observation remain crucial.

Abstract: Background Online synchronous learning in higher education frequently struggles to overcome the social presence gap, resulting in dissatisfaction and poor learning outcomes. Objectives This study examined the effectiveness of desktop‐based virtual reality (VR) social platforms compared to video conferencing (VC) platforms in enhancing students' learning gains and experiences in online synchronous learning. Methods The study used a within‐subject design, involving 34 college students in two online lecture modules, one via a VR social platform and another through a VC platform. Knowledge assessments occurred pre‐ and post‐modules and after 1 week. Students also completed post‐module questionnaires to evaluate their learning experience, in terms of social presence, easiness of use and perceived emotions. In‐depth interviews provided further insights into their experiences with both platforms. Results The study showed that using VR social platforms for online synchronous learning enhanced immediate knowledge, especially in students less interested in the content, yet it did not notably impact long‐term knowledge retention. Despite no significant findings in social presence from questionnaires, interviews indicated that the VR's heightened interactivity might be offset by the effect of not seeing others' real appearances in promoting social presence. Furthermore, the VC platform was found to be easier to use, attributed to its familiarity and user‐friendliness. Finally, students experienced increased fun, awe and interest, along with reduced boredom, when using the VR social platform. Conclusion The findings highlight the potential of VR to enrich online learning while underscoring the need for effective strategies facilitating a smooth integration into educational settings. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is currently known about this topic Social presence is crucial in online learning. VC platforms may fail to efficiently bridge the social presence gap.

Abstract: The current study examines the relative impact of take home (open book) examinations (THE) and in class (closed book) examinations (ICE) on student academic performance and wellbeing outcomes. Specifically, this study contributes to our understanding about students’ long-term knowledge retention, measured four to six months after completing the course. A unique longitudinal dataset consisting of four cohorts of a social science bachelor and master course that implemented either a THE or ICE in successive years was used. Survey data included wellbeing and academic performance measures as well as a 10-item knowledge retention quiz. Within the master course, the ICE cohort had higher examination grades and higher knowledge retention scores than the cohorts that completed a THE. In the bachelor course, there were no differences in knowledge retention across cohorts. Examination score was associated with higher knowledge retention scores across both courses. One bachelor cohort reported lower wellbeing compared to others (cohort 2021–2022); however, we found no further differences in academic or wellbeing outcomes based on examination form. The findings suggest a slight advantage of ICEs over THEs with regard to academic performance.

Semi-Supervised Online Continual Learning for 3D Object Detection in Mobile Robotics

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/semi-supervised-online-continual-learning-3d/docview/3120252001/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Continual learning addresses the challenge of acquiring and retaining knowledge over time across multiple tasks and environments. Previous research primarily focuses on offline settings where models learn through increasing tasks from samples paired with ground truth annotations. In this work, we focus on an unsolved, challenging, yet practical scenario, specifically, the semi-supervised online continual learning in autonomous driving and mobile robotics. In our settings, models are tasked with learning new distributions from streaming unlabeled samples and performing 3D object detection as soon as the LiDAR point cloud arrives. Additionally, we conducted experiments on both the KITTI dataset, our newly built IUSL dataset and Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) Dataset. The results indicate that our method achieves a balance between rapid adaptation and knowledge retention, showcasing its effectiveness in the dynamic and complex environment of autonomous driving and mobile robotics. The developed ROS packages and IUSL dataset will be publicly available at: https://github.com/npu-ius-lab/OCL3D .

Evaluating the Dynamics of Learning Approaches: A Systematic Review Investigating the Nexus Between Teaching Methods and Academic Performance in Medical and Dental Education

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/evaluating-dynamics-learning-approaches/docview/3114264020/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In recent decades, a noticeable trend has emerged in medical and dental schools to adjust their curricula to promote learning strategies and habits geared towards long-term knowledge retention. This systematic review therefore sought to examine whether different teaching methods influence students’ preferred learning approaches (deep, strategic, and surface approach) and indirectly affect their academic performance. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive overview of the inconsistencies evident in previous literature regarding the relationship between learning approaches and academic performance of medical and dental students. A thorough search across eight databases yielded 49 relevant studies published between the years 2000 and 2023. The majority of studies revealed that whilst deep and strategic learners tend to excel at medical or dental school, surface learners appear to struggle under intense workload and pressure. Hence, a common consensus emerged amongst the existing literature that there is a relative benefit in attempting to guide students towards deep and strategic learning habits and to minimise surface-related learning strategies. However, results also conveyed that merely modifying the teaching methods used in medical and dental schools has limited merit. As such, the results emphasised the lack of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ teaching method. Common factors influencing learning approaches were subsequently identified, and based on these findings, an outlook was put forth to integrate a cognitive neuroscience approach into higher education. These directions for future investigations aim to help students reach their full potential by understanding the processes underlying efficient learning and by being mindful of respective encouraging and discouraging factors.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) on learning outcomes in radiography training using Virtual Medical Coaching's X-Ray Pro VR software. VR offers immersive experiential learning that may enhance academic performance and professional preparedness. INTRODUCTION This study investigates the impact of Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) on learning outcomes in radiography training using Virtual Medical Coaching's X-Ray Pro VR software. VR offers immersive experiential learning that may enhance academic performance and professional preparedness.The study involved 130 students from two consecutive cohorts: one using traditional training methods and the other using VR software. We employed a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative measures of academic performance and clinical competency with qualitative insights into student engagement, enjoyment, and stress levels. The VR group used Virtual Medical Coaching simulation software, while the traditional group used physical simulation machines (Siemens Healthineers) to practice positioning anthropomorphic manikins, adjusting exposure settings, and handling X-ray equipment. Data were collected at four points: immediately post-training and at 1 month, 3 months, and 8 months follow-up.

Data were collected at four points: immediately post-training and at 1 month, 3 months, and 8 months follow-up.The VR cohort showed significantly higher knowledge retention, work readiness, and lower stress levels compared to the traditional cohort. Among the participants trained in VR, a vast majority (59 out of 65) reported a high level of satisfaction with the immersive nature of the training, emphasizing its realism and direct applicability to clinical scenarios. Quantitative analysis revealed superior performance metrics for the VR group across all measured time points (p < 0.001). Qualitative feedback highlighted enhanced engagement and enjoyment among VR-trained students.

Abstract: "Test-enhanced learning" is a strategy utilized to impact knowledge retention. This study aimed to assess the effect of the frequency of spaced retrieval using repeat testing on knowledge depreciation in a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Program. OBJECTIVE "Test-enhanced learning" is a strategy utilized to impact knowledge retention. This study aimed to assess the effect of the frequency of spaced retrieval using repeat testing on knowledge depreciation in a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Program.The study randomly assigned second-year pharmacy students to one of three retrieval practice groups: (1) two retrieval practice assessments (2 and 4 months after the course), (2) one retrieval practice assessment (4 months after the course), or (3) no retrieval practice. A final assessment was administered to all participants 6 months after the course. The retrieval assessments and final assessment consisted of five multiple-choice questions on asthma pharmacotherapy. METHODS The study randomly assigned second-year pharmacy students to one of three retrieval practice groups: (1) two retrieval practice assessments (2 and 4 months after the course), (2) one retrieval practice assessment (4 months after the course), or (3) no retrieval practice. A final assessment was administered to all participants 6 months after the course. The retrieval assessments and final assessment consisted of five multiple-choice questions on asthma pharmacotherapy.In total, 94 participants were included in the study, with 32 in Group 1 and 31 in both Groups 2 and 3. All three groups performed similarly on the final assessment regardless of the frequency of spaced retrieval. While Group 1 scored numerically higher than Group 2 on the 4-month retrieval practice assessment and did not impact performance on the final assessment. In Group 1, final assessment scores were decreased compared to the two previous retrieval assessments. RESULTS In total, 94 participants were included in the study, with 32 in Group 1 and 31 in both Groups 2 and 3. All three groups performed similarly on the final assessment regardless of the frequency of spaced retrieval. While Group 1 scored numerically higher than Group 2 on the 4-month retrieval practice assessment and did not impact performance on the final assessment. In Group 1, final assessment scores were decreased compared to the two previous retrieval assessments.Regardless of the frequency of spaced retrieval following the academic course where asthma pharmacotherapy was initially learned, retrieval practice using multiple choice assessments, with the gap times of this study, did not impact asthma pharmacotherapy knowledge depreciation among second-year student pharmacists. CONCLUSION Regardless of the frequency of spaced retrieval following the academic course where asthma pharmacotherapy was initially learned, retrieval practice using multiple choice assessments, with the gap times of this study, did not impact asthma pharmacotherapy knowledge depreciation among second-year student pharmacists.

Abstract: Effective classroom management is essential for creating an optimal learning environment, particularly in large classes. However, pre-service teachers often struggle to develop this competency through traditional training methods such as instructional videos and role-playing, which fail to provide authentic practice opportunities. This study investigated the efficacy of an innovative Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) system, ClassMaster, in enhancing pre-service teachers’ classroom management skills. A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving 57 pre-service teachers randomly assigned to either an IVR group using ClassMaster or a control group using video-based learning. Participants’ classroom management competencies, self-efficacy, attitudes, and reflective thinking were assessed through pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed tests. Results revealed that while both methods improved immediate classroom management competencies equally, the IVR group demonstrated significantly better performance on delayed tests, indicating enhanced long-term knowledge retention. The IVR group also reported more positive attitudes towards classroom management. Reflective thinking levels were comparable between the two groups. Qualitative interviews highlighted the perceived benefits of the IVR system, including its innovative, immersive, and practical nature, which contributed to a profound and lasting impact on participants’ learning experiences. The study concludes that IVR-based learning, through systems like ClassMaster, offers a promising approach to enhancing pre-service teachers’ classroom management competencies, particularly in large class contexts. The research underscores the potential of IVR as a transformative tool in teacher education, warranting further exploration and integration into teacher training programs.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the BaMidbar Mental Health Training program and the influence the training had on community educator populations. This was a mixed method exploratory case study which utilized observational data and five interviews. A survey which examined the possible impacts of the trainings (through relevance and confidence variables) was utilized. We found that participants’ confidence had a higher correlation to the likelihood of implementing training materials than the relevance the training had to participants’ job placements. We also found categories of perceived skill development articulated by the participants interviewed. These skills included: checking in, changing spaces, giving students choices, giving feedback and identifying behaviors. There were concerns that the training programs did not create enough knowledge retention of specific therapeutic terms or scaffolding skills for educators to embed the training content into their job placements. Suggestions for further research and training programs are listed in the conclusion.

Abstract: The emergency resuscitation nurse is a challenging and specialised role at the forefront of critical care practice in the emergency department. Despite their extensive specialist knowledge and skill requirements, in Australia there is no state-wide or nationally agreed approach to how to best provide training that meets a set of fixed objectives and requisite skills for resuscitation nurses. Due to an ageing nursing population and increasing workforce attrition, an efficacious accelerated pathway to acquire specialist resuscitation nursing knowledge, is necessary. BACKGROUND The emergency resuscitation nurse is a challenging and specialised role at the forefront of critical care practice in the emergency department. Despite their extensive specialist knowledge and skill requirements, in Australia there is no state-wide or nationally agreed approach to how to best provide training that meets a set of fixed objectives and requisite skills for resuscitation nurses. Due to an ageing nursing population and increasing workforce attrition, an efficacious accelerated pathway to acquire specialist resuscitation nursing knowledge, is necessary.The aim of this review is to identify, consolidate and summarise the available evidence on the training needs for the requisite clinical and non-technical skills of emergency resuscitation nurses ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Papers about nurses currently working in the emergency department; including Nurse Unit Managers (NUMs), Clinical Nurse Educators (CNEs), Clinical Nurse Consultants (CNCs), Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs), Registered Nurses (RNs) and Enrolled Nurses (ENs) were included. The review included primary and non-primary research, including papers addressing how emergency nurses are trained. There was no date limitation set to ensure all results could be reviewed. Papers that were not published in English, included nurses who were not working in the ED, or included doctors, allied health, and other staff where population cohorts could not be distinguished, were excluded. Abstract only, editorials, conference posters or oral presentations, were also excluded.

SOURCES OF EVIDENCE Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL and EMCARE. The authors conducted extensive hand-searching of the included study reference lists as well as the grey literature to ensure that all relevant literature was captured.A scoping literature review was conducted. METHODS A scoping literature review was conducted.Data extraction was conducted on the final 33 articles (23 peer reviewed studies and 10 competency and practice standards documents). Specific training requirements to achieve competence in the requisite clinical and non-technical skills in resuscitation nursing do not exist. A decline in competency without regular reinforcement was reported. Multi-modal approaches, incorporating diverse teaching methods, show potential in enhancing knowledge retention and skill acquisition. RESULTS Data extraction was conducted on the final 33 articles (23 peer reviewed studies and 10 competency and practice standards documents). Specific training requirements to achieve competence in the requisite clinical and non-technical skills in resuscitation nursing do not exist. A decline in competency without regular reinforcement was reported. Multi-modal approaches, incorporating diverse teaching methods, show potential in enhancing knowledge retention and skill acquisition.Resuscitation nursing lacks a standardised training approach in Australia, leading to a gap in ensuring consistent skill acquisition and knowledge among nurses. Research is required to identify what resuscitation nursing skills and training are necessary to ensure practice effectively meets the needs of patients. CONCLUSION Resuscitation nursing lacks a standardised training approach in Australia, leading to a gap in ensuring consistent skill acquisition and knowledge among nurses. Research is required to identify what resuscitation nursing skills and training are necessary to ensure practice effectively meets the needs of patients.

Abstract: The current study examines the relative impact of take home (open book) examinations (THE) and in class (closed book) examinations (ICE) on student academic performance and wellbeing outcomes. Specifically, this study contributes to our understanding about students’ long-term knowledge retention, measured four to six months after completing the course. A unique longitudinal dataset consisting of four cohorts of a social science bachelor and master course that implemented either a THE or ICE in successive years was used. Survey data included wellbeing and academic performance measures as well as a 10-item knowledge retention quiz. Within the master course, the ICE cohort had higher examination grades and higher knowledge retention scores than the cohorts that completed a THE. In the bachelor course, there were no differences in knowledge retention across cohorts. Examination score was associated with higher knowledge retention scores across both courses. One bachelor cohort reported lower wellbeing compared to others (cohort 2021–2022); however, we found no further differences in academic or wellbeing outcomes based on examination form. The findings suggest a slight advantage of ICEs over THEs with regard to academic performance. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: ABSTRACT Objective: Concept Maps (CM) aid in the acquisition of new information, and comprehend prior knowledge with better retention. Their use is not explored in undergraduate surgical education in our country, hence this study aimed to compare the surgery test scores of undergraduate medical students taught by concept maps and interactive lectures. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was carried out at the Department of Surgery, at a Private University Hospital among 60 students of fourth year MBBS from 2017-2018. The students were divided into Group-A taught by interactive lectures and Group-B taught by CM. Post class Multiple Choice Questions test was taken and scores were compared for immediate effects on knowledge and short term knowledge retention using the Unpaired t-test. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Our study reported a mean test score of 19.5 (2.75 ± 0.49) for the Group-A, while 21.1 (3.49 ± 0.65) for Group-B with a negative t value of 2.003 with a significant p-value of 0.05. This showed that the test scores of Group-A were lower than the scores of Group-B. Conclusions: Concept Maps is an effective and promising way to give learners better understanding of complex concepts in short amounts of time. providing valuable evidence for instituting the use of concept maps as a continuous teaching strategy for medical students.

Abstract: Traditional dental anatomy education, reliant on cadaver dissections and lectures, faces challenges such as high costs, ethical concerns, and difficulty conveying complex 3D dental structures. Virtual reality (VR) offers a solution by providing immersive, interactive learning environments that can enhance students' understanding. This study systematically reviews the effectiveness of VR in dental anatomy education compared to traditional methods, focusing on its potential to improve learning outcomes. BACKGROUND Traditional dental anatomy education, reliant on cadaver dissections and lectures, faces challenges such as high costs, ethical concerns, and difficulty conveying complex 3D dental structures. Virtual reality (VR) offers a solution by providing immersive, interactive learning environments that can enhance students' understanding. This study systematically reviews the effectiveness of VR in dental anatomy education compared to traditional methods, focusing on its potential to improve learning outcomes.A comprehensive search was conducted across Web of Science (WoS), PubMed, and Scopus databases until May 2024. Data were extracted, summarized, and analyzed for qualitative synthesis. The following keywords and their combinations were used: " dental OR dentistry", "education OR teaching", "virtual AND reality OR VR", and "anatomy OR dental AND anatomy". Studies were included if they met the following criteria: Investigated the use of VR in anatomy education. Compared VR-based learning to other methods such as lecture-based teaching, 3D printed or natural models, or non-interactive 3D models. Quantitative synthesis was performed using standardized mean differences (SMD) with Hedges'd and 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Quantitative synthesis was performed using standardized mean differences (SMD) with Hedges'd and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Out of 178 records screened, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis and eight in the personal evaluation analysis. The analysis indicates a moderately positive effect of VR on dental anatomy education (SMD = 0.74, p = 0.05) compared to lecture-based education using X-ray, CBCT, or 3D models. However, at the same time, VR falls short compared to clinical experience, training with physical teeth, or quality printed models. Studies reported rare cases of discomfort, disorientation, diplopic image, and VR sickness. RESULTS Out of 178 records screened, seven studies were included in the meta-analysis and eight in the personal evaluation analysis. The analysis indicates a moderately positive effect of VR on dental anatomy education (SMD = 0.74, p = 0.05) compared to lecture-based education using X-ray, CBCT, or 3D models. However, at the same time, VR falls short compared to clinical experience, training with physical teeth, or quality printed models. Studies reported rare cases of discomfort, disorientation, diplopic image, and VR sickness.The use of VR-based learning moderately positively affects educational outcomes, and enhances knowledge retention, especially before clinical experience. The personal evaluation of students showed a strong interest in VR, with positive feedback on its ease of use, accuracy, and educational value. CONCLUSIONS The use of VR-based learning moderately positively affects educational outcomes, and enhances knowledge retention, especially before clinical experience. The personal evaluation of students showed a strong interest in VR, with positive feedback on its ease of use, accuracy, and educational value.

Abstract: The influence of women in shaping household dietary habits is undeniable, with their maternal nutritional knowledge significantly impacting the overall well-being of their families. The study objective was to evaluate the impact of maternal nutritional knowledge on household dietary habits, emphasising the improvement in women's nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours. INTRODUCTION The influence of women in shaping household dietary habits is undeniable, with their maternal nutritional knowledge significantly impacting the overall well-being of their families. The study objective was to evaluate the impact of maternal nutritional knowledge on household dietary habits, emphasising the improvement in women's nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours.This study aimed to assess the immediate and long-term effects of a nutrition education intervention on the nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours of women. PURPOSE This study aimed to assess the immediate and long-term effects of a nutrition education intervention on the nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours of women.A quasi-experimental research design was employed to assess the effects of a Nutrition Education Programme (NEP) on female caregivers' nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours. This study followed a four-phase approach: baseline survey, programme formulation, implementation and evaluation. Data were collected at various stages of this study using two measurement tools: a Dietary Diversity Questionnaire and a Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire. METHODOLOGY A quasi-experimental research design was employed to assess the effects of a Nutrition Education Programme (NEP) on female caregivers' nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours. This study followed a four-phase approach: baseline survey, programme formulation, implementation and evaluation. Data were collected at various stages of this study using two measurement tools: a Dietary Diversity Questionnaire and a Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire.Statistical analysis was performed to answer the research questions and to test the null hypotheses at a significance level of 0.05. The intervention positively affected nutrition knowledge, with the mean percentage increasing from 49.1% to 63.7% and reaching 64.4% at follow-up, indicating long-term knowledge retention. The findings of this study suggest a positive shift towards increased consumption of nutrient-rich food groups. There were significant improvements in the food groups' consumption of the meat group (7.15 ± 2.35), eggs (1 ± 0), dairy (3.76 ± 1.19), cereal (8.78 ± 2.09), legumes (2.86 ± 0.95) and fats and oils (2.12 ± 0.55). Additionally, the variety of food groups consumed significantly improved ( p = 0.012) post-intervention, with an increasing trend in the consumption of a variety of food groups (7-9). RESULTS Statistical analysis was performed to answer the research questions and to test the null hypotheses at a significance level of 0.05. The intervention positively affected nutrition knowledge, with the mean percentage increasing from 49.1% to 63.7% and reaching 64.4% at follow-up, indicating long-term knowledge retention.

Additionally, the variety of food groups consumed significantly improved (p = 0.012) post-intervention, with an increasing trend in the consumption of a variety of food groups (7-9).Tailored nutrition education (NE) programs, in conjunction with addressing socioeconomic barriers positively impact nutritional behaviours, promote healthier food consumption patterns and assist in long-term knowledge retention in disadvantaged communities. RECOMMENDATION Tailored nutrition education (NE) programs, in conjunction with addressing socioeconomic barriers positively impact nutritional behaviours, promote healthier food consumption patterns and assist in long-term knowledge retention in disadvantaged communities.

Abstract: Active learning techniques are taking the classroom by storm. Numerous research articles have highlighted the benefits of active learning techniques on student understanding, knowledge retention, problem solving, and teamwork. One avenue to introduce active learning into the classroom is the gamification of course learning content. Educational escape rooms are one such example in which students solve a series of puzzles related to course content to “escape” within a set time frame. Escape games play an interesting role in motivating students, building communication skills and allowing for multimodal learning, having been shown to increase students’ test results and enjoyment of the course content. In lieu of the traditional escape room format, a fully immersive room(s) with classical escape room puzzles (finding items, riddles, alternative locking mechanisms) is used alongside learning activities, and educators have begun to develop truncated activities for easier applications in larger classrooms. In this review, we explore several escape room activities: immersive, paper-based, Battle Boxes, condensed escape activities, and online/virtual, providing examples of the types of puzzles included therein. We similarly discuss the creation of escape room materials and recommendations for the interested educator, as well as the learning benefits of engaging in puzzle development. Finally, we provide an overview on methods to assess active learning through escape rooms, establishing an overview of empirical evidence towards their effectiveness as a learning tool.

Abstract: Although learning approaches are designed to enhance individuals' ability to store and retrieve information, not all of them are considered effective. The goal of the present study was to experimentally compare the test performance as well as the accuracy of metacognitive judgements of a multiple text reading group, rereading group, and single reading group in a one-day vs. one-week delayed test (3 × 2 between subject design). A total of 186 psychology students (Mage = 20.76) participated in the experiment focused on reading comprehension, accuracy of metacognitive judgments and knowledge retention. Results of the knowledge test indicate that in the one-day delayed test, multiple text reading and rereading yield similar results: both deliver slightly better results than single reading. In the one-week delayed test, though, multiple text reading yields better results than rereading, and both these reading approaches outperform single reading. Moreover, multiple text reading results in fairly robust knowledge retention with only a slight decrease in scores between the one-day delayed and one-week delayed test. Regarding metacognitive monitoring, judgements of learning in the multiple text reading group remained relatively stable after each reading and participants were underconfident about their knowledge. In the rereading group, judgements of learning increased after each reading and participants were overconfident about their knowledge, especially on the one-day delayed test. These findings have implications for educational practices aimed at enhancing learning outcomes and promoting effective learning.

Abstract: Three eye-tracking experiments were designed to determine the influence of textual and graphic cues on motor skill learning in short instructional videos. Experiment 1 (n = 45) manipulated the colour of picture cues (red arrows, white arrows, and without cue). Experiment 2 (n = 49) manipulated the position of textual cues (image adjacency, image distance, and without textual cues). Experiment 3 (n = 67) examined the effect of combined textual-picture cues and conducted a 2 (Picture Cue: red arrow vs. white arrow) × 2 (Text Cue: image adjacency, vs. image distance) between-subjects design. Results showed that adding picture cues and textual cues helped learners do better with knowledge tests, reduced cognitive load, and spent more time focusing on the instructional video. Moreover, providing both red arrows and text cues away from the image proved to be an effective combination that achieved better learning outcomes.

Abstract: Course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) exposes an entire class of students to scientific research and is thought to increase students’ knowledge retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students’ favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated. CURE-type courses are worth popularising in biology teaching.

Effects of embedded questions in pre-class videos on learner perceptions, video engagement, and learning performance in flipped classrooms

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of embedded questions in pre-class instructional videos on learner perceptions (cognitive load, emotional engagement, satisfaction, judgement of learning), video engagement (total views, total viewing time), and learning performance (retention, transfer). The research occurred in a real flipped classroom environment. We designed a quasi-experiment in which 86 university students from two natural classes watched pre-class instructional videos featuring procedural knowledge with or without interpolated true or false questions. Students were asked to practice the operation steps introduced in the videos. While they practiced operations, they could either pause the videos or let the videos continue playing. Face-to-face contact time was utilised to consolidate and extend previewed content with student-centred, instructor-facilitated problem-solving activities. Results revealed no discernible effects from embedded questions in pre-class videos on cognitive load, emotional engagement, satisfaction, judgement of learning, total views, knowledge retention or knowledge transfer. We speculate that the various in-class practice activities and frequent access to procedural knowledge videos offset the cognitive benefits derived from question-embedded videos. Learners who viewed question-embedded videos presented significantly reduced total viewing time, likely because the embedded questions scaffolded them in sustaining attention and efficiently pinpointing the exact information needed. Future research should identify boundary conditions for embedding questions in instructional videos (e.g. learning mode, type of knowledge) rather than indiscriminately applying this design strategy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE To determine if an escape room game approach, which has emerged as a novel and engaging education tool, is an effective method to improve nursing students’ knowledge of pressure injury (PI) prevention and attitudes toward the care of patients with a PI. METHODS This study evaluated 33 university nursing students using a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design. Students completed five questionnaires before the escape room experience and again 1 month after. RESULTS After the intervention, the students’ mean scores on their self-reported PI knowledge level, Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Assessment Tool 2.0, Pressure Injuries Prevention Knowledge Questionnaire, and Attitude towards Pressure Ulcer Prevention Instrument all significantly increased ( P s < .001). Further, the mean score on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was significantly lower postintervention ( P < .001), indicating decreased anxiety. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that the escape room game approach is an effective method to improve nursing students’ knowledge of PI prevention and attitudes toward the care of patients with PIs. This method also improved students’ knowledge retention by promoting facilitated learning in solving complex cases.

Abstract: This systematic review evaluates the impact of trauma care and emergency preparedness training programs on prehospital primary survey effectiveness. A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), focusing on studies involving healthcare professionals such as paramedics, nurses, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs). The review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical trials, and cohort studies that assessed various training modalities like virtual reality (VR) simulations, case-based learning (CBL), and hands-on workshops. Quality assessment was performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) tool for randomized trials and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for clinical trials, ensuring methodological rigor and consistency. The findings suggest that CBL significantly improves knowledge retention and prehospital primary survey skills, outperforming other methods such as simulation exercises, which showed mixed results. VR training increased confidence levels but did not demonstrate significant improvements in objective skills compared to traditional methods. The use of supplementary triage assistance teams (physician-nurse supplementary triage team (MDRNSTAT)) was found to be effective during high patient volume hours, though not cost-effective as a daytime strategy. While the review highlights the importance of interactive and scenario-based training programs, limitations such as variability in study designs, publication bias, and language bias were noted, suggesting that caution should be exercised in generalizing the results. Future research should focus on long-term effectiveness, the integration of emerging technologies, and larger, well-designed trials across diverse healthcare settings to strengthen the evidence base.This systematic review evaluates the impact of trauma care and emergency preparedness training programs on prehospital primary survey effectiveness.

Abstract: Problem-based learning (PBL) in medical education is centered around a problem or case and is learner-led, involving small groups and problem-solving. PBL is ubiquitous in North American undergraduate medical education (UGME) due to reported learner satisfaction, efficacy, and long-term knowledge retention; however, its application to postgraduate medical education (PGME) is less defined. This review addresses the knowledge gap on the use and efficacy of PBL in PGME, specifically among primary care specialties due to their unique training needs, using the Kirkpatrick model as the theoretical basis for interpreting results. A search for articles using PubMed resulted in 17 selected articles that included primary care PGME learners undergoing at least one PBL session led by another learner. Learners were overwhelmingly satisfied with PBL, reporting increased confidence and comfort in the subject area. While none of the studies measured behavior change objectively, over half reported increased comfort in diagnosing, prescribing, and managing patients. This review extends the positive feedback found from PBL in UGME settings to apply to PGME and highlights the suitability of PBL for primary care due to increased confidence, learner satisfaction, perceived knowledge gain, and objective learning outcomes.Problem-based learning (PBL) in medical education is centered around a problem or case and is learner-led, involving small groups and problem-solving.

Abstract: Mathematical inquiry involving hands-on activities has received increasing attention in mathematics education. Besides various customized physical teaching aids, subject-specific information technology, such as Dynamic Geometry System (DGS), finds extensive use in mathematical inquiry activities. However, effects of DGS and physical manipulatives on inquiry-based math learning remain an open question. Hence, by adopting a quasi-experimental research design, this paper aims to empirically compare the immediate learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and learning interest of seventh-grade students who explore with virtual manipulatives (i.e., the DGS) and who explore with physical manipulatives. Specifically, 131 students participated in learning activities centered on exploring pyramids and prisms. During the inquiry process, Group A ( n  = 33) constructed pyramids and prisms in DGS, Group B ( n  = 34) observed pre-made virtual models in DGS, Group C ( n  = 32) observed physical models, and Group D ( n  = 32) made physical pyramids and prisms with polymer clay and small sticks. Moreover, pretest, post-test, and delayed post-test designed according to the Van Hiele model, as well as an adapted interest questionnaire, were employed to evaluate students’ performances; and collected data were analyzed by means of ANCOVA and t-test. Findings of the study revealed that in the context of construction, students employing the DGS exhibited superior immediate learning outcomes and greater knowledge retention compared to their peers who utilized physical manipulatives; while in the case of observation, the virtual and physical manipulatives yielded similar impacts on students’ immediate learning outcomes, but students who involved in the DGS demonstrated higher knowledge retention. Furthermore, regarding the DGS environment, students who engaged in constructive manipulation surpassed their peers who engaged in observing manipulation. In terms of interest, the DGS proved to be more effective in both stimulating and maintaining higher interest compared to the physical manipulatives, and constructive manipulation was more effective than observing manipulation. In summary, as compared to the physical manipulatives, DGS, particularly when employed with constructive strategy, has shown to encourage students to more actively engage in task-related cognitive behaviors, thereby supporting and enhancing inquiry-based math learning of students in junior high school.

Current estimates show that the United States is not on pace to meet elimination targets due to multiple patient, clinic, institutional, and societal level barriers that contribute to HCV testing and treatment gaps. Among these barriers are unawareness of testing and treatment needs, misinformation concerning adverse treatment reactions, need for substance use sobriety, and treatment efficacy. Strategies to improve viral hepatitis education are needed. BACKGROUND The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have set ambitious hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination targets for 2030. Current estimates show that the United States is not on pace to meet elimination targets due to multiple patient, clinic, institutional, and societal level barriers that contribute to HCV testing and treatment gaps. Among these barriers are unawareness of testing and treatment needs, misinformation concerning adverse treatment reactions, need for substance use sobriety, and treatment efficacy. Strategies to improve viral hepatitis education are needed.We aim to provide a high-quality HCV educational app for patients and health care workers, particularly nonprescriber staff. The app was vetted by health care providers and designed to guide users through the HCV testing and treatment stages in a self-exploratory way to promote engagement and knowledge retention. The app is comprised of five learning modules: (1) Testing for Hep C (hepatitis C), (2) Tests for Hep C Positive Patients, (3) Treatments Available to You, (4) What to Expect During Treatment, and (5) What to Expect After Treatment. OBJECTIVE We aim to provide a high-quality HCV educational app for patients and health care workers, particularly nonprescriber staff.

The app is comprised of five learning modules: (1) Testing for Hep C (hepatitis C), (2) Tests for Hep C Positive Patients, (3) Treatments Available to You, (4) What to Expect During Treatment, and (5) What to Expect After Treatment.An HCV knowledge assessment survey was administered to providers and patients at the Yale School of Medicine and 11 Connecticut HIV clinics as part of a grant-funded activity. The survey findings and pilot testing feedback guided the app's design and content development. Data on app usage from November 2019 to November 2022 were analyzed, focusing on user demographics, engagement metrics, and module usage patterns. METHODS An HCV knowledge assessment survey was administered to providers and patients at the Yale School of Medicine and 11 Connecticut HIV clinics as part of a grant-funded activity. The survey findings and pilot testing feedback guided the app's design and content development. Data on app usage from November 2019 to November 2022 were analyzed, focusing on user demographics, engagement metrics, and module usage patterns.There were 561 app users; 216 (38.5%) accessed the training modules of which 151 (69.9%) used the app for up to 60 minutes. Of them, 65 (30.1%) users used it for >60 minutes with a median time spent of 5 (IQR 2-8) minutes; the median time between initial accession and last use was 39 (IQR 18-60) days. Users accessed one or more modules and followed a nonsequential pattern of use: module 1: 163 (75.4%) users; module 4: 82 (38%); module 5: 67 (31%); module 3: 49 (22.7%); module 2: 41 (19%).

It offers the convenience of on-demand education, allowing users to access crucial information about HCV management and treatment in a self-directed fashion that acknowledges and promotes variable preferences in learning approaches. While app uptake was relatively limited, we propose that future efforts should focus on combined promotion efforts with marketing strategies experts aligned with academic experts. Incorporating ongoing user feedback and integrating personalized reminders and quizzes, will further enhance engagement, supporting the broader public health HCV elimination goals.

Abstract: Although Valley fever represents a growing public health challenge for Central and Southern Californian residents, awareness remains severely limited. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) ran a cross-platform campaign to mitigate this awareness gap and impact prevention behavior. This study evaluates exposure to the CDPH campaign, followed by an examination of the information consumption patterns associated with key health outcomes. Results suggest that the CDPH campaign successfully improved knowledge accuracy, reduced misperceptions, and increased the likelihood of prevention behavior. Using an information repertoire lens revealed a more nuanced account. Most information repertoires positively influenced accurate knowledge retention and prevention behavior compared to those who were not exposed. The most diverse information repertoire, including interpersonal and media channels, was associated with increased knowledge accuracy, affective risk concerns, personal susceptibility, and prevention behavior. However, exposure to this repertoire was also associated with greater misperceptions. In addition, medical professional and radio-based repertoires positively influenced personal susceptibility perceptions. Overall, this research illustrates the importance of examining not only the general outcomes of health campaigns but also the patterns of information acquisition – particularly when working with underserved communities whose health information consumption preferences may not be comprehensively reflected in the literature.

Abstract: Purpose To explore the future of former anatomy tutors, their perception of the impact that the anatomy near-peer teaching (NPT) program have had on them, in terms of academic performance, professional development, personal growth, long-term anatomical knowledge, and views on body donor ethics. Additionally, we compared their academic performance with non-tutor peers in terms of ranking at the National Qualifying Examination (NQE). Methods A voluntary survey was emailed to all anatomy tutors from 2005 to 2024, using an online Google Forms questionnaire including closed and open-ended questions across four themes. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare former tutors’ NQE rankings to their peers. Results Forty-seven out of 48 tutors responded. Tutors reported a positive program impact, including improvements in technical skills (100%), teamwork (97.9%), communication (89.4%), and organizational skills (76.6%), and good long-term anatomical knowledge retention (85.7%). Dissection on body donors was deemed essential for anatomy learning while shaping professional and ethical values. Of the 36 residents/specialists, 38.9% ranked in the top 10% at the NQE, with a statistically significant higher rank than their peers ( p  = 0.0011), and 100% obtained their desired specialty. Conclusion This results suggest that the anatomy NPT program significantly enhanced tutors’ academic performance, technical skills, personal and professional development, and was useful to foster a positive perception of dissection on body donors and reinforced the importance of anatomical knowledge in clinical practice.

Abstract: Clinical Data Warehouses (CDW) are the designated infrastructures to enable access and analysis of large quantities of electronic health record data. Building and managing such systems implies extensive "data work" and coordination between multiple stakeholders. Our study focuses on the challenges these stakeholders face when designing, operating, and ensuring the durability of CDWs for research. OBJECTIVES Clinical Data Warehouses (CDW) are the designated infrastructures to enable access and analysis of large quantities of electronic health record data. Building and managing such systems implies extensive "data work" and coordination between multiple stakeholders. Our study focuses on the challenges these stakeholders face when designing, operating, and ensuring the durability of CDWs for research.We conducted semistructured interviews with 21 professionals working with CDWs from France and Belgium. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded inductively. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted semistructured interviews with 21 professionals working with CDWs from France and Belgium. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded inductively.Prompted by the AI boom, healthcare institutions launched initiatives to repurpose data they were generating for care without a clear vision of how to generate value. Difficulties in operating CDWs arose quickly, strengthened by the multiplicity and diversity of stakeholders involved and grand discourses on the possibilities of CDWs, disjointed from their actual capabilities. Without proper management of the information flows, stakeholders struggled to build a shared vision. This was evident in our interviewees' contrasting appreciations of what mattered most to ensure data quality. Participants explained they struggled to manage knowledge inside and across institutions, generating knowledge loss, repeated mistakes, and impeding progress locally and nationally. RESULTS Prompted by the AI boom, healthcare institutions launched initiatives to repurpose data they were generating for care without a clear vision of how to generate value. Difficulties in operating CDWs arose quickly, strengthened by the multiplicity and diversity of stakeholders involved and grand discourses on the possibilities of CDWs, disjointed from their actual capabilities.

This was evident in our interviewees' contrasting appreciations of what mattered most to ensure data quality. Participants explained they struggled to manage knowledge inside and across institutions, generating knowledge loss, repeated mistakes, and impeding progress locally and nationally.Management issues strongly affect the deployment and operation of CDWs. This may stem from a simplistic linear vision of how this type of infrastructure operates. CDWs remain promising for research, and their design, implementation, and operation require careful management if they are to be successful. Building on innovation management, complex systems, and organizational learning knowledge will help. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Management issues strongly affect the deployment and operation of CDWs.

Abstract: Although Valley fever represents a growing public health challenge for Central and Southern Californian residents, awareness remains severely limited. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) ran a cross-platform campaign to mitigate this awareness gap and impact prevention behavior. This study evaluates exposure to the CDPH campaign, followed by an examination of the information consumption patterns associated with key health outcomes. Results suggest that the CDPH campaign successfully improved knowledge accuracy, reduced misperceptions, and increased the likelihood of prevention behavior. Using an information repertoire lens revealed a more nuanced account. Most information repertoires positively influenced accurate knowledge retention and prevention behavior compared to those who were not exposed. The most diverse information repertoire, including interpersonal and media channels, was associated with increased knowledge accuracy, affective risk concerns, personal susceptibility, and prevention behavior. However, exposure to this repertoire was also associated with greater misperceptions. In addition, medical professional and radio-based repertoires positively influenced personal susceptibility perceptions. Overall, this research illustrates the importance of examining not only the general outcomes of health campaigns but also the patterns of information acquisition - particularly when working with underserved communities whose health information consumption preferences may not be comprehensively reflected in the literature.Although Valley fever represents a growing public health challenge for Central and Southern Californian residents, awareness remains severely limited.

Abstract: Pediatric nursing students are required to be taught how to overcome their own psychological stress during their internship in order to understand sick children's emotional reactions, as well as to be able to interact and communicate with such children. This quasi-experimental study proves that the application of AI image health education e-books by the nursing teacher is more effective than traditional paper handout teaching materials in improving nursing students' self-efficacy when using therapeutic games to deal with and reduce sick children's fears of medical examinations and treatments ( p < 0.05). AI-driven tools can enable the development of personalized e-learning materials that target specific areas for cognitive improvement. This targeted approach can enhance knowledge retention and skill development, resulting in better-prepared healthcare professionals.Pediatric nursing students are required to be taught how to overcome their own psychological stress during their internship in order to understand sick children's emotional reactions, as well as to be able to interact and communicate with such children.

Abstract: The Eastern Mediterranean Region suffers disproportionately from paediatric traffic-related injuries. Despite governmental laws, Lebanon-an eastern Mediterranean country-has low child restraint (CR) use prevalence. This study examined the impact of using car seat distribution, and child passenger safety education and awareness intervention to improve child passenger safety knowledge and practices among caregivers. BACKGROUND The Eastern Mediterranean Region suffers disproportionately from paediatric traffic-related injuries. Despite governmental laws, Lebanon-an eastern Mediterranean country-has low child restraint (CR) use prevalence. This study examined the impact of using car seat distribution, and child passenger safety education and awareness intervention to improve child passenger safety knowledge and practices among caregivers.This study recruited Lebanese caregivers with one child or more, using a 4-wheel motor vehicle, and not using a car seat. The intervention comprised an educational session followed by a car seat or booster seat distribution and installation check by a certified child passenger safety technician. A baseline assessment questionnaire was used to identify reasons for prior CR non-use. A child passenger safety knowledge test was administered before, immediately after and 3 months postintervention to assess child passenger safety knowledge retention and compare it to the baseline using the conditional logit model for pre-post interventions. METHODS This study recruited Lebanese caregivers with one child or more, using a 4-wheel motor vehicle, and not using a car seat. The intervention comprised an educational session followed by a car seat or booster seat distribution and installation check by a certified child passenger safety technician. A baseline assessment questionnaire was used to identify reasons for prior CR non-use. A child passenger safety knowledge test was administered before, immediately after and 3 months postintervention to assess child passenger safety knowledge retention and compare it to the baseline using the conditional logit model for pre-post interventions.Fifty-eight participants underwent the intervention. Affordability was identified as the primary reason for car seat non-use. Three months after the intervention, compliance with CRs use was reported at 100%, and correct responses on the knowledge test significantly increased (p<0.05) for all items except for harness tightness (p=0.673). RESULTS Fifty-eight participants underwent the intervention. Affordability was identified as the primary reason for car seat non-use. Three months after the intervention, compliance with CRs use was reported at 100%, and correct responses on the knowledge test significantly increased (p<0.05) for all items except for harness tightness (p=0.673).Our child passenger safety intervention resulted in improved knowledge and increased self-reported use of CRs in a caregivers' cohort in Lebanon. Further efforts should address sociocultural and economic barriers and the lack of local child passenger safety technicians to mitigate the region's paediatric road traffic injury and death toll. CONCLUSION Our child passenger safety intervention resulted in improved knowledge and increased self-reported use of CRs in a caregivers' cohort in Lebanon. Further efforts should address sociocultural and economic barriers and the lack of local child passenger safety technicians to mitigate the region's paediatric road traffic injury and death toll.

Abstract: Educational multimedia is a cost-effective and straightforward way to administer large-scale information interventions to patient populations in musculoskeletal health care. While an abundance of health research informs the content of these interventions, less guidance exists about optimizing their design. BACKGROUND Educational multimedia is a cost-effective and straightforward way to administer large-scale information interventions to patient populations in musculoskeletal health care. While an abundance of health research informs the content of these interventions, less guidance exists about optimizing their design.This study aims to identify randomized controlled trials of patient populations with musculoskeletal conditions that used multimedia-based patient educational materials (PEMs) and examine how design was reported and impacted patients' knowledge and rehabilitation outcomes. Design was evaluated using principles from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML). OBJECTIVE This study aims to identify randomized controlled trials of patient populations with musculoskeletal conditions that used multimedia-based patient educational materials (PEMs) and examine how design was reported and impacted patients' knowledge and rehabilitation outcomes. Design was evaluated using principles from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML).PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched from inception to September 2023 for studies examining adult patients with musculoskeletal conditions receiving multimedia PEMs compared to any other interventions. The primary outcome was knowledge retention measured via test scores. Secondary outcomes were any patient-reported measures. Retrievability was noted, and PEMs were sourced through search, purchase, and author communication. METHODS PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched from inception to September 2023 for studies examining adult patients with musculoskeletal conditions receiving multimedia PEMs compared to any other interventions. The primary outcome was knowledge retention measured via test scores. Secondary outcomes were any patient-reported measures. Retrievability was noted, and PEMs were sourced through search, purchase, and author communication.A total of 160 randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion: 13 (8.1%) included their educational materials and 31 (19.4%) required a web search, purchase, or direct requests for educational materials. Of these 44 (27.5%) studies, none fully optimized the design of their educational materials, particularly lacking in the CTML principles of coherence, redundancy, modality, and generative activities for the learner. Of the 160 studies, the remaining 116 (72.5%) contained interventions that could not be retrieved or appraised. Learning was evaluated in 5 (3.1%) studies. RESULTS A total of 160 randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion: 13 (8.1%) included their educational materials and 31 (19.4%) required a web search, purchase, or direct requests for educational materials.

Of the 160 studies, the remaining 116 (72.5%) contained interventions that could not be retrieved or appraised. Learning was evaluated in 5 (3.1%) studies.Musculoskeletal studies should use open science principles and provide their PEMs wherever possible. The link between providing multimedia PEMs and patient learning is largely unexamined, but engagement potential may be maximized when considering design principles such as the CTML. CONCLUSIONS Musculoskeletal studies should use open science principles and provide their PEMs wherever possible. The link between providing multimedia PEMs and patient learning is largely unexamined, but engagement potential may be maximized when considering design principles such as the CTML.

Abstract: The operating room is a high-risk environment where proper patient positioning is crucial for minimizing injury and ensuring optimal access to surgical sites. This process requires effective collaboration among surgical team members, particularly operating room nurses who play a vital role in patient safety. Despite advancements in technology, challenges such as pressure injuries persist, with a significant incidence rate. Video-based training (VBT) emerges as a promising educational tool, enhancing knowledge retention and fostering a learner-centered approach. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VBT on adherence to surgical positioning standards, highlighting its potential to improve safety protocols in the operating room. BACKGROUND The operating room is a high-risk environment where proper patient positioning is crucial for minimizing injury and ensuring optimal access to surgical sites. This process requires effective collaboration among surgical team members, particularly operating room nurses who play a vital role in patient safety. Despite advancements in technology, challenges such as pressure injuries persist, with a significant incidence rate. Video-based training (VBT) emerges as a promising educational tool, enhancing knowledge retention and fostering a learner-centered approach. This study aims to evaluate the impact of VBT on adherence to surgical positioning standards, highlighting its potential to improve safety protocols in the operating room.In this clinical trial, 62 qualified operating room nurses (50 women, 12 men, average age: 28.90 ± 3.75 years) were randomly divided into control and intervention group (n = 31 in each group). The control group only received positioning recommendations, but in the intervention group, in addition to the recommendations, video-based surgical positioning training was performed for 1 month, at least 3 times a week. The performance of nurses in both groups was evaluated through a researcher-made checklist at baseline and post-intervention. METHODS In this clinical trial, 62 qualified operating room nurses (50 women, 12 men, average age: 28.90 ± 3.75 years) were randomly divided into control and intervention group (n = 31 in each group). The control group only received positioning recommendations, but in the intervention group, in addition to the recommendations, video-based surgical positioning training was performed for 1 month, at least 3 times a week. The performance of nurses in both groups was evaluated through a researcher-made checklist at baseline and post-intervention.Based on findings, there was no significant difference between the two groups in compliance with surgical positioning standards at baseline (p = 0.07). However, after the intervention, compliance scores significantly improved in the VBT group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The VBT group showed a mean improvement of 62.12 points, while the control group improved by 10.77 points (p < 0.001). RESULTS Based on findings, there was no significant difference between the two groups in compliance with surgical positioning standards at baseline (p = 0.07). However, after the intervention, compliance scores significantly improved in the VBT group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The VBT group showed a mean improvement of 62.12 points, while the control group improved by 10.77 points (p < 0.001).This preliminary study demonstrated a notable improvement in compliance with surgical positioning standards among operating room nurses following VBT intervention. Despite the promising results, the small sample size and preliminary nature of the research necessitate further studies to confirm these findings and assess long-term outcomes. These initial insights highlight the potential of innovative training methods in enhancing surgical practices.

Abstract: Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants is vital to local communities and cultural heritage, particularly in Ethiopia. This study aims to document native medicinal plants in the Jawi district, including associated traditional knowledge. The study involved conducting semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and guided field walks with a purposefully selected 54 traditional healers. The study identified 87 medicinal plant species from 50 families used treat over 50 ailments, with a preference for wild herbs. Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Solanaceae were the most prominent families, each with five species; Zehneria scabra, was the most often mentioned species, followed by Lepidium sativum, Myrica salicifolia, Carissa spinarum, and Momordica foetida. 43% of identified species were herbs, with 44% of remedies made from roots. Pounding was the most common preparation method, and oral application was the most frequent use, followed by dermal application. 60% plants treated human ailments, 16% treated livestock, and 24% were used for both. Preference rankings indicated specific plants favored for certain ailments. The study highlights key plant families and species crucial for local healthcare but notes threats like habitat destruction and knowledge loss. Urgent conservation actions are needed to preserve medicinal plants and inform future research and strategies.Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants is vital to local communities and cultural heritage, particularly in Ethiopia.

Abstract: In recent decades, a noticeable trend has emerged in medical and dental schools to adjust their curricula to promote learning strategies and habits geared towards long-term knowledge retention. This systematic review therefore sought to examine whether different teaching methods influence students’ preferred learning approaches (deep, strategic, and surface approach) and indirectly affect their academic performance. Furthermore, it provides a comprehensive overview of the inconsistencies evident in previous literature regarding the relationship between learning approaches and academic performance of medical and dental students. A thorough search across eight databases yielded 49 relevant studies published between the years 2000 and 2023. The majority of studies revealed that whilst deep and strategic learners tend to excel at medical or dental school, surface learners appear to struggle under intense workload and pressure. Hence, a common consensus emerged amongst the existing literature that there is a relative benefit in attempting to guide students towards deep and strategic learning habits and to minimise surface-related learning strategies. However, results also conveyed that merely modifying the teaching methods used in medical and dental schools has limited merit. As such, the results emphasised the lack of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ teaching method. Common factors influencing learning approaches were subsequently identified, and based on these findings, an outlook was put forth to integrate a cognitive neuroscience approach into higher education. These directions for future investigations aim to help students reach their full potential by understanding the processes underlying efficient learning and by being mindful of respective encouraging and discouraging factors.

Egocentric skilled human activity psychomotor training: A case study involving mechanical simulated part-based process

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/egocentric-skilled-human-activity-psychomotor/docview/3114248871/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) training shows promise for developing skilled psychomotor movements compared to traditional methods. This paper presents a case study of using VR simulation to train prospective drivers on proper snow chain installation technique. An anti-skid snow-chain was 3D modeled, rigged and animated with physical properties, providing realistic high-fidelity behavior for VR users. A virtual world and an immersive egocentric VR training scenario, supporting simulated VR user actions, tailored to specific user interactions, were further developed using Unreal Engine. A usability evaluation experiment with twenty-five drivers provided auto-logged quantitative metrics, and qualitative feedback, gathered during the training process. Despite the limited sample size, initial findings and the demonstration of high proficiency by trainees during the training scenario, suggest that VR enables meaningful advantages for the development of complex psychomotor skills, for the trainees involved in the specific training scenario. These initial conclusions, regarding the impact of VR training in such mechanical simulated part-based process, will be greatly useful for studies dealing with the learning impact and knowledge retention of VR training.

Abstract: The integration of Virtual Reality (VR) with Case-Based Learning (CBL) has the potential to revolutionise undergraduate medical education, particularly in complex subjects such as the anatomy and rehabilitation of the shoulder joint. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of this innovative approach in enhancing learning outcomes and knowledge retention. BACKGROUND The integration of Virtual Reality (VR) with Case-Based Learning (CBL) has the potential to revolutionise undergraduate medical education, particularly in complex subjects such as the anatomy and rehabilitation of the shoulder joint. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of this innovative approach in enhancing learning outcomes and knowledge retention.This study employed a parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. A comprehensive five-week educational programme was developed, combining traditional lecture-based learning with VR-enhanced CBL. The study involved 82 undergraduate students from China Medical University, who were divided into groups receiving different combinations of VR and CBL. Student performance was evaluated through tests and questionnaires. METHODS This study employed a parallel-group, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. A comprehensive five-week educational programme was developed, combining traditional lecture-based learning with VR-enhanced CBL. The study involved 82 undergraduate students from China Medical University, who were divided into groups receiving different combinations of VR and CBL. Student performance was evaluated through tests and questionnaires.In the anatomy-related courses, the integration of VR technology with CBL yielded significantly higher results (87.71 ± 5.60) compared to traditional methods (82.59 ± 6.64), with a statistically significant difference (P   0.05). RESULTS In the anatomy-related courses, the integration of VR technology with CBL yielded significantly higher results (87.71 ± 5.60) compared to traditional methods (82.59 ± 6.64), with a statistically significant difference (P   0.05).The present study provides preliminary evidence for the benefits of incorporating VR into medical education, particularly in anatomy. While the results are promising, further research is needed to explore the optimal integration of VR and CBL in rehabilitation studies and to assess their long-term impact on student learning and clinical performance. CONCLUSION The present study provides preliminary evidence for the benefits of incorporating VR into medical education, particularly in anatomy. While the results are promising, further research is needed to explore the optimal integration of VR and CBL in rehabilitation studies and to assess their long-term impact on student learning and clinical performance.The study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trials Registry (Registration Number: ChiCTR2400089295) on 05/09/2024.

Abstract: In this article, we present a systematic review of the literature that explores the impact of Machine Learning as a teaching strategy in the educational field. Machine Learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, has gained relevance in teaching and learning due to its ability to personalize education and improve instructional effectiveness. The systematic review focuses on identifying studies investigating how Machine Learning has been used in educational settings. Through a thorough analysis, its impact on various areas related to teaching and learning, including student performance, knowledge retention, and curricular adaptability, is examined. The findings of this review indicate that Machine Learning has proven to be an effective strategy for tailoring instruction to individual student needs. As a result, engagement and academic performance are significantly improved. Furthermore, the review underscores the importance of future research. This future research will enable a deeper understanding of how Machine Learning can optimize education and address current challenges and emerging opportunities in this evolving field. This systematic review provides valuable information for educators, curriculum designers, and educational policymakers. It also emphasizes the continuing need to explore the potential of Machine Learning to enhance teaching and learning in the digital age of the 21st century.

Abstract: Background: FAST Heroes is a kindergarten-based educational program that teaches young children and their extended families (parents, grandparents), the main stroke symptoms (Face, Arm, and Speech), and the timely and appropriate steps in the event of a suspected stroke (Time). However, post-campaign knowledge retention remains a challenge. Aims: The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether and to what extent grandparents’ stroke knowledge is maintained 44 months after the initial implementation of the program. Methods: Forty-five participants engaged in the present study (35 women, 10 men; 72.8§5.3) and completed an adapted version of the FAST Heroes Stroke Preparedness Questionnaire via phone calls. Results: Compared to immediately post-program implementation, respondents were still able to recall arm weakness (OR = 1.63; p = 0.246) and slurred speech (OR = 2.02; p = 0.075) as main stroke symptoms. A decrease was observed in recalling facial drooping (OR = 0.44; p = 0.042). Reporting of the appropriate course of action, was found to be increased (OR = 4.17; p < 0.001). Respondents remembered the emergency number to call, i.e., 112 (OR = 0.97; p = 0.947). Conclusion: The results showed that awareness regarding the common signs of a stroke and the importance of promptly contacting emergency services following a stroke, in the population group mostly affected by stroke, is retained. Exploring knowledge preservation in a greater sample size is warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Humans naturally engage in playful activities throughout their lives and play serves as a fundamental mechanism for cognitive development as well as the development of essential soft skills such as teamwork, decision-making, leadership, and communication. Recognizing this innate predisposition for play, educators are increasingly embracing gamification strategies into their classrooms. More attention has been driven to digital tools such as platforms Kahoot! and Duolingo which gained popularity and demonstrated the potential of game-based learning to increase engagement and knowledge retention. However, concerns about digital screen time fuelled a renewed interest in non-digital activities, including educational games. Non-digital games are often more accessible and affordable, making them suitable for schools with limited resources. Research suggests that non-digital games can effectively promote collaboration, communication, and critical thinking skills. In addition, they offer flexibility to teachers to adapt rules and scenarios to specific learning objectives and student needs. Recognizing the benefits of employing games as a pedagogical strategy, the first author of this study opted to incorporate game-based learning strategies into her classes, on a regular basis. Throughout the semester, various non-digital games were implemented, inspired on well-known classics such as memory card games, Monopoly and Pictionary. These games were carefully designed to address specific mathematics topics identified as either the most relevant or those where students revealed more difficulties. The participants in this study were pre-service pre- and primary school teachers enrolled in a maths undergraduate course. Since these students are future educators, the games served a dual purpose: improving current learning experiences and providing teaching resources for their future classrooms. At the end of the semester, a survey was conducted to evaluate students' perceptions towards the use of games in the mathematics teaching-learning process. In this paper we describe some of the games used in this study and analyse the results of the survey. Previous studies reveal that students generally welcome the incorporation of games, perceiving them as effective tools for enhancing motivation and promoting positive learning outcomes. Our findings corroborate these studies.

Abstract: This paper examines how sustainability education can be effectively integrated into game-based learning (GBL) to enhance environmental consciousness. As global ecological challenges intensify, instilling sustainable practices in future generations becomes crucial. GBL offers an engaging platform to embed sustainability concepts through immersive and interactive virtual environments. The study explores the theoretical underpinnings of sustainability education and GBL, highlighting their synergy in raising awareness and fostering sustainable behaviours. By reviewing existing literature, it evaluates the impact of incorporating sustainability principles into GBL platforms. The discussion includes the integration of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), real-world scenarios, simulations, and collaborative elements to deepen players' understanding and stimulate critical thinking about complex sustainability issues. The paper also examines the role of feedback mechanisms, assessment tools, and adaptive learning approaches in maintaining engagement and knowledge retention. It concludes by advocating for the inclusion of sustainability in GBL as a means to develop environmentally conscious citizens. Leveraging the immersive nature of games, educators can cultivate a generation equipped to understand and address sustainability challenges, contributing to innovative educational approaches for promoting sustainable practices.

Abstract: Prerequisite courses have been a staple in admissions requirements for health programs for more than a century. Prerequisites serve various roles including achieving accreditation standards, determining academic preparation, predicting academic success, and informing admissions decisions. While the theories purported to support prerequisite courses have largely remained static, the challenges for educators and applicants have evolved. In addition to training future healthcare providers, contemporary educators are focused on attracting and training a diverse workforce as well as attaining enrollment targets to ensure financial stability. We propose 4 assumptions that pit common prerequisite practices against these contemporary challenges including limitations caused by the cost of prerequisites, disproportionate burden on underrepresented minorities, extraordinarily complex and variable policies, and a disconnect between grades and knowledge retention. Continuing to operate under these assumptions creates unnecessary barriers for potential students. We offer model practices for approaching prerequisites with more flexibility. These practices involve refining expectations for learning, normalizing alternatives to coursework, conducting prospective research, analyzing relevant data, and exploring more personalized pathways and holistic practices. As higher education changes and the demand for healthcare providers increases, innovation to the admissions process is needed to identify those who can complete programs and become competent healthcare providers.

Abstract: Lay midwives attend most births at home in Guatemala facing many challenges with limited resources. Current research demonstrates that acupressure can reduce preterm contractions and encourage post-term labor. Sharing acupressure techniques with lay midwives could improve birth outcomes in Guatemala. The purpose of this study was to deliver an educational session for lay midwives to assess their learning and satisfaction with acupressure, and its feasibility and usefulness in their work. Purpose Lay midwives attend most births at home in Guatemala facing many challenges with limited resources.

Sharing acupressure techniques with lay midwives could improve birth outcomes in Guatemala. The purpose of this study was to deliver an educational session for lay midwives to assess their learning and satisfaction with acupressure, and its feasibility and usefulness in their work.Two acupressure protocols were designed based on the clinical expertise of University of Utah College of Nursing faculty and extant literature. Demographic data and a pretest were conducted, followed by a focus group and various educational activities. A post-test was administered, and participants were given Spanish-language, laminated Reminder Cards with acupressure point illustrations to reinforce knowledge retention as the group had a low literacy rate. This study was IRB approved. Methods Two acupressure protocols were designed based on the clinical expertise of University of Utah College of Nursing faculty and extant literature.

Lay midwives lacked knowledge about acupressure before the educational session and were eager to learn. Afterward, most participants recalled six points to discourage preterm labor and six points to encourage post-term labor on a post-test, and expressed an intent to use their new acupressure knowledge with patients.

Abstract: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training is crucial for nursing students as future nurses are the first responders in the ambulatory and hospital care chain. Simulation-based learning has been shown to be more effective in acquiring the knowledge and technical and non-technical skills required for CPR. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of high-fidelity simulation-based adult CPR training on the acquisition and retention of knowledge and the development of technical and non-technical skills of nursing students at the Higher Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques in Fez, Morocco. BACKGROUND Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training is crucial for nursing students as future nurses are the first responders in the ambulatory and hospital care chain. Simulation-based learning has been shown to be more effective in acquiring the knowledge and technical and non-technical skills required for CPR. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of high-fidelity simulation-based adult CPR training on the acquisition and retention of knowledge and the development of technical and non-technical skills of nursing students at the Higher Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques in Fez, Morocco.We conducted an interventional study with 49 nursing students. Twenty-five students (51.02%) in the simulation group received both traditional CPR training (theoretical lecture and demonstration of procedures) and simulation CPR training, while 24 students (48.97%) in the control group received only traditional training. Data were obtained using a questionnaire on theoretical knowledge of CPR, a technical skills assessment grid, and the Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) for non-technical skills. METHODS We conducted an interventional study with 49 nursing students. Twenty-five students (51.02%) in the simulation group received both traditional CPR training (theoretical lecture and demonstration of procedures) and simulation CPR training, while 24 students (48.97%) in the control group received only traditional training. Data were obtained using a questionnaire on theoretical knowledge of CPR, a technical skills assessment grid, and the Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) for non-technical skills.The post-test scores for theoretical knowledge immediately after simulation were significantly higher for the simulation group (16.41±1.73 out of 20) than for the control group (13.15±1.96 out of 20). Mean CPR knowledge retention scores 30 days after training were significantly higher in the simulation group (15.60±1.71) compared with the control group (11.38±1.93). Assessment of technical skills on a high-fidelity mannequin showed a considerable advantage for the simulation group (30.88±1.64 out of 34) over the control group (18.00±0.78 out of 34). In addition, the results demonstrated a significant difference between the TEAM score of the simulation group (37.84±2.67 out of 44) and the control group (22.33±0.96 out of 44) and a significant difference between the Global Team Performance of the simulation group (8.16±0.68) out of 10 and the control group (4.83±0.38). RESULTS The post-test scores for theoretical knowledge immediately after simulation were significantly higher for the simulation group (16.41±1.73 out of 20) than for the control group (13.15±1.96 out of 20). Mean CPR knowledge retention scores 30 days after training were significantly higher in the simulation group (15.60±1.71) compared with the control group (11.38±1.93).

Abstract: Objective: To ensure whether spaced education, which increases long-term knowledge retention, could be integrated into auditor competency assessment. Design: Quality improvement project. Setting: Academic, freestanding children’s hospital. Participants: Hand hygiene (HH) auditors. Intervention: We enrolled trained HH auditors in an online spaced-education platform to assess mastery of knowledge, delivering 46 unique questions at spaced intervals followed by rationale; we retired questions after 3 correct answers. An e-mailed 10-item survey gauged participant satisfaction with the program. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare change in median knowledge score from first to final attempt. Results: A total of 12,120 questions were attempted by 126 auditors, and 49 (39%) completed the entire course. Median knowledge score increased significantly by 10.5 percentage points (IQR 4–15) between first and final attempts ( P < 0.001). Thirty auditors (27%) responded to the survey. The majority agreed the number and complexity of questions were appropriate (57% and 67%, respectively). Eighty-seven percent reported the platform easy to navigate, and 77% agreed adequate time was provided for completion. Free-text suggestions included delivering fewer questions at a narrower spacing interval over a shorter time frame because of competing work demands. Conclusions: Auditor knowledge of HH indications and technique is critical to ensuring data validity. A spaced-education competency program improved HH auditor knowledge in the short term. Completion rate was low, and some participants expressed a desire for fewer questions over a shorter time frame. This study offers insight into ways to optimize spaced education as a potential tool for HH competency assessment.

Abstract: Purpose The aim of this paper is to clearly mark the clusters in the related literature using bibliometric analysis and draw useful implications for the academic research purposes especially in the stream of Supply Chain Management (SCM). Design/methodology/approach By employing rigorous selection criteria, sample articles were selected for synthesizing and conducting a bibliometric analysis. This paper tries to identify the significance of the concept of reshoring with the aspect of SCM, operations, logistics etc. Starting from sample selection, systematic selection criteria has been used to generate the database, using Scopus. The sample size was 184. Using VOSViewer, statistical and graphical representations were generated for clusters in the literature that will be useful for judging the trends of research under shoring concepts. Findings Findings show that unclear difference compared to other supply chain concepts obstructs further theory development within reshoring concepts. To address this challenge, the review categorizes themes and defines boundaries. Based on the analysis findings, this paper advocates for additional research in areas that are crucial but have received limited or no attention. Specifically, there is a need for action research on motivations, governance modes, and location selection concerning reshoring decisions. Research limitations/implications This review has a few limitations. The absence of publications in other language, than English, may result in a significant loss of knowledge. This research paper cited a few relevant publications in the form of conference papers, industry reports, books, and book chapters. Nonetheless, they were excluded from the organized bibliometric audit. To further advance the knowledge in this field, exploratory longitudinal case studies will bring to focus the changes on manufacturing strategies using the shoring and reshoring stages. Practical implications A current example of this is a French company named Stil (Terzian, 2020) which brought its glass thermometer production back to its home after the unexpected closure of its suppliers from China. Another Italian firm has restarted production of disposal bio-degradable face masks after 15 years to compete with low-cost alternatives from China (Greco, 2020). Reshoring concepts are now under consideration of organizations including Boeing, Bosch, Phillips and more. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this represents one of the earliest efforts to conceptualize and define reshoring concepts, aiming to distinguish them from one another appropriately. To accomplish this, the earlier demarcated clusters precede this section’s classification of reshoring concepts illustrated in Table 8. Based on the synthesis of definitions and thematic clusters above, we have concluded the literature review in this emerging field. It is intended to contribute to theory development and practitioner support in reshoring decisions by clarifying the dimensions.

Abstract: Background and objectives The pitstop method of teaching involves short educational videos that entail a stepwise approach to augment knowledge retention and understanding. Short videos stimulate both visual and auditory pathways, thereby improving learner's experiences, knowledge retention, and understanding of the concept, which will help with long-term memory. In this study, we aimed to compare the pitstop method of teaching with the didactic lecture technique based on assessment and feedback. Methodology After obtaining the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) approval, a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 210 phase II MBBS students who gave consent to participate in the study. Two sessions comprising a total of 10 videos with five videos in each session were planned for a particular system. Two types of teaching methodology were used in the videos. For session 1, a short video using a presentation template was used. For session 2, a short video using hand notes and figures was prepared and incorporated into the video. Each video was two minutes in duration. Students were divided into A and B batches. For session 1, A batch was the control group and B batch was the test group; for session 2, the test and control groups were reversed. Pre-test and post-test exercises were conducted for each session. Results were analyzed and statistical analysis was performed at the end of the project. Results An analysis of both sessions was done for the A and B batches. For session 1, the test group fared well with a mean of 4.50 compared to the control group with a mean of 3.53. For session 2, the test group performed well with a mean of 4.43 compared to the control group with a mean of 3.87. No significant difference was observed when the test groups of the two sessions were compared (p=0.74). Conclusions Short videos delivered by using the pitstop method will help stimulate memory and enhance the attention of students to better process the information. We believe that the implementation of this method will lead to good outcomes among the students.Background and objectives The pitstop method of teaching involves short educational videos that entail a stepwise approach to augment knowledge retention and understanding.

Abstract: Background The voices virtual on‐screen characters use has been shown to impact learning and perception outcomes. Recent replication research on these voices showed that synthetic voices were not a detriment if produced by a high‐quality engine with clear articulation. The current manuscript examines previous accent research that utilized now outdated engines, to determine if the impact of accents still holds with high‐quality engines and voice actors. Objectives To investigate the impact on learning and perceptions with pedagogical agents speaking in accented voices, synthetic voices, and the interaction between the two using modern voice engines. Methods This study is a between‐subjects two (accent) by two (type) factorial design to determine the impact the voice accent, voice type, and the interaction have on learning retention, learning transfer, mental effort efficiency, and perception measures. 197 participants were recruited from the online Amazon's Mechanical Turk with qualifications of 18 years of age, “normal or corrected‐to‐normal hearing”, and located with the continental United States of America. Results and Conclusions There were no significant differences between the accented conditions or interaction effects, deviating from previous research that showed impact of accents on learning. The synthetic condition had significantly lower knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, mental effort efficiency, and perception measures than the human professional. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering voice quality when designing pedagogical agents. Previous research showed synthetic voices perform as well as the average voice, and this research continues the narrative of voice quality by showing professional recordings outperform modern synthetic engines. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is currently known about this topic Accents and synthetic voices can impact learning from virtual humans. What does this paper add Shows professional human voices outperform modern synthetics, a quality effect. Implications for practice/or policy Creators of educational materials should aim for professional voice actors.

Audience The target audience for this small group workshop are interns and residents of any specialty.All residents are expected to become proficient teachers in a variety of settings as they progress in training, and many residency programs offer advanced training or credentialing in medical education.1,2 Recently, some emergency medicine programs have also begun to offer a formal medical education fellowship. Traditional resident education has been in the form of didactic lectures such as morning report, noon conference, and Grand Rounds as well as small group bedside teaching by attendings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in many cases these learning structures have been reengineered into a hybrid or virtual model.3 This new educational paradigm has spurred the search for best practice teaching methods across a variety of situations. 4 Active teaching, characterized by audience engagement and self-directed learning, has been shown to promote deeper understanding and improved knowledge retention when compared to standard didactic teaching.5,6Educational curricula for residents now acknowledge the importance of audience participation, with more emphasis on the use of interactive teaching techniques. A review of residents-as-teachers curricula highlighted the importance of disseminating practical resources for how to effectively teach residents to be better educators.7 However, in the literature there are few examples of how to teach residents to implement these best practice interactive teaching methods. We designed a simple, interactive, and easily reproducible workshop for introducing the concepts of active teaching to residents that allows for active engagement with these techniques. Introduction All residents are expected to become proficient teachers in a variety of settings as they progress in training, and many residency programs offer advanced training or credentialing in medical education.1,2 Recently, some emergency medicine programs have also begun to offer a formal medical education fellowship. Traditional resident education has been in the form of didactic lectures such as morning report, noon conference, and Grand Rounds as well as small group bedside teaching by attendings.

A review of residents-as-teachers curricula highlighted the importance of disseminating practical resources for how to effectively teach residents to be better educators.7 However, in the literature there are few examples of how to teach residents to implement these best practice interactive teaching methods. We designed a simple, interactive, and easily reproducible workshop for introducing the concepts of active teaching to residents that allows for active engagement with these techniques.By the end of this small group exercise, learners will be able to: 1) assess interactive teaching techniques that support learning in various environments; 2) incorporate active teaching techniques into a variety of real-world teaching scenarios; 3) implement selected techniques to enrich one's own teaching practice. Educational Objectives By the end of this small group exercise, learners will be able to: 1) assess interactive teaching techniques that support learning in various environments; 2) incorporate active teaching techniques into a variety of real-world teaching scenarios; 3) implement selected techniques to enrich one's own teaching practice.Our workshop was designed to include elements of gamification, which facilitates teamwork and competition and can be used to engage learners in higher levels of learning.8 We began by performing a literature search for descriptions of active teaching techniques that had been used in the medical setting.9-14 We developed a list of 15 popular active teaching strategies and created a one-page menu which briefly described each strategy. Utilizing the flipped classroom model, we identified three articles (references 10, 11, and 14) which reviewed active teaching techniques and sent these articles to our participants via email one week before our session with instructions to read the articles and come prepared to discuss them at our session. We created two sets of playing cards for our activity. The first set of playing cards was titled "teaching setting" and included common venues for teaching in clinical medicine: morning report, grand rounds warm-up (which at our institution consists of a 15-minute lecture given to a large audience in a formal setting), small group, bedside teaching, journal club, and an online/virtual lecture. The second set of playing cards included simulated audiences that could be present at a teaching session: peers (residents), medical students, attendings, or mixed audience. To account for larger groups of residents, we made multiple copies of each card within the respective card set.At the beginning of the workshop, the learning objectives were discussed and the menu with the 15 active teaching techniques was reviewed along with the assigned pre-reading articles. Residents were asked to name different active teaching techniques and give examples they experienced during their residency or medical school education. Participants (pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents) were then placed in groups of three or four, and each group drew one teaching setting card and one audience card. All groups were given the same general topic (diabetic ketoacidosis) and each group was challenged to design a short teaching activity relevant to the topic that incorporated active teaching techniques appropriate for their setting and audience. After a short period of planning, each group reported how they would teach the topic and which active teaching strategies they would use. After each group described their approach, they received peer feedback from the other groups' participants. Key aspects of the proposed active teaching techniques and any barriers to implementation were discussed. The cards were then reshuffled for each group, and the exercise was repeated with a different general topic (in our session, we chose developmental milestones).

Research Methods Participants provided anonymous feedback in the form of surveys which assessed the efficacy of the workshop. Participants were also asked to commit to three active teaching techniques they would incorporate into teaching sessions within the next six months.Our workshop was presented for two sequential years: 2022 and 2023. Our workshop was attended by 32 residents in year one and 36 residents in year two. All participants filled out the anonymous evaluation survey at the conclusion of the exercise. Eighty-five percent of respondents rated the session as "highly organized," and a majority strongly agreed that the workshop was effective for learning active teaching techniques (78%) and taught them concrete techniques that they could incorporate into their future teaching (88%). Participants reported that they were most likely to utilize Jigsaw (31 respondents), Polling/audience response (29 respondents), case-based learning (25 respondents), role play (24 respondents) and small group activities (20 respondents) into their next teaching session. In our second workshop, there were 19 participants who had also attended the first workshop. All 19 of these residents reported using at least one active teaching technique during the previous year, and over half reported using at least three of the techniques.

All 19 of these residents reported using at least one active teaching technique during the previous year, and over half reported using at least three of the techniques.Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the organization and efficacy of this workshop. The strategies of using sets of cards to randomize the process, adding time constraints, and having each group report their teaching plans increased overall participant interest and excitement in the workshop. Having all groups design teaching sessions using the same general topic was chosen intentionally to promote friendly competition and to allow for discussion among the groups about similarities and differences in the application of their chosen active teaching techniques. To apply our activity to other specialties, we recommend choosing general topics that are commonly encountered in that specialty; for example, the topic of "myocardial infarction" or "pediatric toxidromes" could be used for emergency medicine residents.

Abstract: This is a review curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to enhance the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers (nurses and physicians). Audience and Type of Curriculum This is a review curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to enhance the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers (nurses and physicians).8-10 hours. Length of Curriculum 8-10 hours.Early recognition and stabilization of critical pediatric patients can improve outcomes. Compared with resource-rich systems, many low-resource settings (i.e., LMICs) rely on generalists to provide most pediatric acute care. We created a curriculum for general practitioners comprising multiple educational modules focused on identifying and stabilizing pediatric emergencies. Our aim was to develop an educational framework to update and teach generalists on the recommendations and techniques of optimally evaluating and managing pediatric nutritional and gastrointestinal emergencies: bowel obstructions, gastroenteritis, and malnutrition. Introduction Early recognition and stabilization of critical pediatric patients can improve outcomes. Compared with resource-rich systems, many low-resource settings (i.e., LMICs) rely on generalists to provide most pediatric acute care. We created a curriculum for general practitioners comprising multiple educational modules focused on identifying and stabilizing pediatric emergencies. Our aim was to develop an educational framework to update and teach generalists on the recommendations and techniques of optimally evaluating and managing pediatric nutritional and gastrointestinal emergencies: bowel obstructions, gastroenteritis, and malnutrition.The aim of this curriculum is to increase learners' proficiency in identifying and stabilizing acutely ill pediatric patients with gastrointestinal medical or surgical disease or complications of malnutrition. This module focuses on the diagnosis and management of gastroenteritis, acute bowel obstruction, and deficiencies of feeding and nutrition. The target audience for this curriculum is generalist physicians and nurses in limited-resource settings. Educational Goals The aim of this curriculum is to increase learners' proficiency in identifying and stabilizing acutely ill pediatric patients with gastrointestinal medical or surgical disease or complications of malnutrition. This module focuses on the diagnosis and management of gastroenteritis, acute bowel obstruction, and deficiencies of feeding and nutrition. The target audience for this curriculum is generalist physicians and nurses in limited-resource settings.The educational strategies used in this curriculum include didactic lectures, medical simulation, and small-group sessions. Educational Methods The educational strategies used in this curriculum include didactic lectures, medical simulation, and small-group sessions.We evaluated written pretests before and posttests after intervention and retested participants four months later to evaluate for knowledge retention. Participants provided qualitative feedback on the module. Research Methods We evaluated written pretests before and posttests after intervention and retested participants four months later to evaluate for knowledge retention. Participants provided qualitative feedback on the module.We taught 21 providers. Eleven providers completed the pretest/posttest and eight completed the retest. The mean test scores improved from 8.3 ± 1.7 in the pretest to 12.2 ± 2.6 in the posttest (mean difference: 1.4, P =0.027). The mean test score at pretest was 8.3 ± 2.3, which increased to 10.8 ± 3.0 at retest (mean difference: 2.5, P =0.060). Seven (71.4%) and four (28.5%) participants found the course "extremely useful" and "very useful," respectively (n=11). Results We taught 21 providers. Eleven providers completed the pretest/posttest and eight completed the retest. The mean test scores improved from 8.3 ± 1.7 in the pretest to 12.2 ± 2.6 in the posttest (mean difference: 1.4, P=0.027). The mean test score at pretest was 8.3 ± 2.3, which increased to 10.8 ± 3.0 at retest (mean difference: 2.5, P=0.060). Seven (71.4%) and four (28.5%) participants found the course "extremely useful" and "very useful," respectively (n=11).This curriculum may be an effective and welcome training tool for Belizean generalist providers. There was a statistically significant improvement in the test performance but not in retesting, possibly due to our small sample size and high attrition rate. Evaluation of other modules in this curriculum, application of this curriculum in other locations, and measuring clinical practice interventions will be included in future investigations.

Abstract: Veterinary programs traditionally teach gross anatomy by having students perform regional dissections on animal cadavers. Dissection is effective but also costly, time consuming, and intimidating for students. These factors, along with reduced contact hours devoted to gross anatomy, warrant investigation of more time-efficient teaching modalities. We sought to determine whether learning anatomy from instructor-prosected cadavers is a suitable alternative to in-class cadaveric dissections. Veterinary students completed nine units of regional gross anatomy over three courses. For each unit, students were randomly assigned to study the region on instructor-prosected cadavers (i.e., prosection students, n = 25) or perform their own dissection of the region in small groups (i.e., dissection students, n = 25). Prosection students spent on average 18 minutes/week less ( p < .05) in class than dissection students. Despite comparable amounts of time spent studying outside of class each week, prosection students outperformed ( p < .05) dissection students on 56% of the practical unit exams and 44% of the overall unit exams, whereas dissection students outperformed ( p < .05) prosection students on only a single unit exam. Prosection students also performed better ( p < .05) on subsequent quizzes administered to assess knowledge retention. Survey responses indicated that students were more confident in the accuracy of prosections and valued the efficiency they provided. Although they found value in performing dissections and were generally satisfied with the knowledge they gained, many students reported feeling timid toward dissecting, which diminished the experience. Together, these findings demonstrate that expertly prosected cadavers were more time-efficient than in-class cadaveric dissections and were generally more effective for learning gross veterinary anatomy.Veterinary programs traditionally teach gross anatomy by having students perform regional dissections on animal cadavers.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and disorders are exceptionally prevalent in the clinical setting. Despite this, physician training in MSK medicine has been historically inadequate contributing to a lack of MSK knowledge, confidence, and clinical skills among postgraduate physicians. The goal of this investigation was to examine the long-term impact of a new preclerkship MSK curriculum implemented by a nationally accredited medical program on postgraduate physician's learning and knowledge retention in the area of MSK medicine. Introduction Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and disorders are exceptionally prevalent in the clinical setting. Despite this, physician training in MSK medicine has been historically inadequate contributing to a lack of MSK knowledge, confidence, and clinical skills among postgraduate physicians. The goal of this investigation was to examine the long-term impact of a new preclerkship MSK curriculum implemented by a nationally accredited medical program on postgraduate physician's learning and knowledge retention in the area of MSK medicine.Five hundred sixty-eight postgraduate physicians (years 1-6) who had previously completed the new curriculum over a 6-year period were recruited to complete a standardized and validated MSK examination that consisted of 30 multiple-choice questions on core or must-know topics in MSK medicine that could be directly mapped to learning objectives within the new preclerkship MSK curriculum. Methods Five hundred sixty-eight postgraduate physicians (years 1-6) who had previously completed the new curriculum over a 6-year period were recruited to complete a standardized and validated MSK examination that consisted of 30 multiple-choice questions on core or must-know topics in MSK medicine that could be directly mapped to learning objectives within the new preclerkship MSK curriculum.Ninety postgraduate physicians completed the examination, obtaining an average score of 75.0% (±10.2; range 57.0-100.0). Physicians who completed MSK-related electives during clerkship training or specialized in fields related to MSK medicine (i.e., orthopaedics, PM&R, sports medicine, and rheumatology) performed significantly better on the MSK examination (p ≤ 0.01). Results Ninety postgraduate physicians completed the examination, obtaining an average score of 75.0% (±10.2; range 57.0-100.0). Physicians who completed MSK-related electives during clerkship training or specialized in fields related to MSK medicine (i.e., orthopaedics, PM&R, sports medicine, and rheumatology) performed significantly better on the MSK examination (p ≤ 0.01).Data indicated that the program's new preclerkship curriculum supports high levels of MSK learning and knowledge retention among postgraduate physicians. These findings are expected to assist with the establishment of minimum curriculum standards and can be used to guide MSK curricular reform at other medical programs. Conclusion Data indicated that the program's new preclerkship curriculum supports high levels of MSK learning and knowledge retention among postgraduate physicians. These findings are expected to assist with the establishment of minimum curriculum standards and can be used to guide MSK curricular reform at other medical programs.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of educational video games as a variety applied to the traditional teaching of pharmacology in topics of antifungal and hypolipidemic drugs. Sixty‐six volunteers were divided into control group ( n  = 33) and experimental group ( n  = 33). The first group received traditional seminar only, and the second played video game designed with the use of Kahoot! platform after the seminar. The assessment of knowledge was conducted with the use of three tests: pre‐test was presented before seminar, post‐test after seminar (for control group) or after playing the video game (for experimental group), and test no. 3 took place 4 weeks later. Analysis of tests' scores with respect to both topics resulted in the observation that the control and experimental groups show statistically significant improvement in knowledge, whether it was measured after the seminar or 4 weeks later. However, the results of experimental group were statistically better in comparison to the control group. It proves that electronic GBL (game‐based learning) applied to standard educational processes increases short‐ and long‐term knowledge retention compared to traditional seminars.

Abstract: Abstract-In recent years, the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data mining, and mobile internet has significantly transformed educational methodologies. Online learning, an emerging educational paradigm, has garnered considerable attention for its accessibility and convenience. Although online education platforms offer learners a high degree of freedom, they lack personalized guidance, leading to challenges such as "Information Overload" and "Knowledge Loss". These challenges primarily manifest as learners struggling to identify resources that match their preferences and needs, adversely affecting their learning efficiency and outcomes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an exercise recommendation algorithm that combines the emerging fields of reinforcement learning and recommendation systems to help learners find suitable exercise resources. Initially, we use a knowledge tracking model to assess the potential knowledge level of learners. Following this, the Deep Q Network algorithm is utilized to modify learners' exercise records by removing unsatisfactory exercises that learners may have mistakenly selected during the learning process. Based on the modified record of exercises and the knowledge levels of learners, the algorithm recommends appropriate exercises. Finally, extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Background The Eastern Mediterranean Region suffers disproportionately from paediatric traffic-related injuries. Despite governmental laws, Lebanon—an eastern Mediterranean country—has low child restraint (CR) use prevalence. This study examined the impact of using car seat distribution, and child passenger safety education and awareness intervention to improve child passenger safety knowledge and practices among caregivers. Methods This study recruited Lebanese caregivers with one child or more, using a 4-wheel motor vehicle, and not using a car seat. The intervention comprised an educational session followed by a car seat or booster seat distribution and installation check by a certified child passenger safety technician. A baseline assessment questionnaire was used to identify reasons for prior CR non-use. A child passenger safety knowledge test was administered before, immediately after and 3 months postintervention to assess child passenger safety knowledge retention and compare it to the baseline using the conditional logit model for pre–post interventions. Results Fifty-eight participants underwent the intervention. Affordability was identified as the primary reason for car seat non-use. Three months after the intervention, compliance with CRs use was reported at 100%, and correct responses on the knowledge test significantly increased (p<0.05) for all items except for harness tightness (p=0.673). Conclusion Our child passenger safety intervention resulted in improved knowledge and increased self-reported use of CRs in a caregivers’ cohort in Lebanon. Further efforts should address sociocultural and economic barriers and the lack of local child passenger safety technicians to mitigate the region’s paediatric road traffic injury and death toll.

Abstract: Remote work and its challenges have been around for decades, yet the COVID19 pandemic brought these challenges to the fore and prompted organisations to address them. One of the challenges is the potential loss of tacit knowledge (knowledge that resides in the heads of “knowers”) among knowledge workers by shifting from in‐person to remote work. This paper reports on the initial findings of a pilot study that interviewed knowledge workers about the interruption of information sharing, the importance of technology to resemble in‐person working, and organization adaptability. The findings highlight the importance of in‐person interactions to exchanging tacit information but indicates that for organisations that are resilient, technology can mimic in‐person sharing.

Abstract: Objective To compare the effects of different educational methods on short and long-term learning outcomes and to investigate the satisfaction and perception of cleft lip and palate (CLP) education among dental students. Design The theoretical exam on CLP to determine their baseline level of knowledge was taken by the participants(T0). After the exam, the students were randomly divided into three groups and all students attended a lecture-based traditional education on CLP. Students in the first group (n = 40) received no additional teaching (Group A). Students in the second group (n = 38) received model teaching with 3D-printed models (Group B). The third group (n = 39) was trained in e-learning-supported education (Group C). The theoretical exam was repeated immediately after the education (T1/short-term learning), one week later (T2/early long-term learning), and one month later (T3/late long-term learning), and the effect of the education methods on information level was assessed. In addition, a post-training satisfaction questionnaire was administered to participants of Group B and Group C. Results Both 3D model-based and e-learning-supported approaches significantly improved immediate knowledge of CLP. However, no significant differences were found in knowledge retention over time between the all methods. A majority of students favored the incorporation of both methods in orthodontic education. Conclusions While both 3D models and e-learning effectively enhance short-term CLP knowledge among dental students, their long-term educational impacts are comparable. However, student preferences indicated that the use of 3D-printed models and e-learning strategies may be useful augmentations to traditional lecture education.

Abstract: Knowledge maps are teaching tools that can promote deeply learning and avoid knowledge loss by helping students plan learning paths. Mining potential association rules of concepts from student exercise data was a common method to construct knowledge maps automatically. While manual conditions should be set to filter the association rules future to improve the accuracy of knowledge maps, which made the construction of the knowledge map can not automatic totally. So, the study proposed a knowledge map construction method that combined knowledge tracking and association rule mining expanding with interaction frequencies based on exercise data to achieve rules cleaning automatically. The method first predicted students’ knowledge mastery sequences by a deep knowledge tracking model and discovered clustering relations to represent potential structures between concepts by fuzzy cluster analysis. Meanwhile, the method investigated association rule mining expanding with interaction frequencies to discover association rules between concepts. Finally, the clustering relations were used to filter the mined association rules automatically. To verify the effectiveness of the method, we constructed a knowledge map based on 34,350 online exercise data of 117 students in a computer programming course. Experimental results proved that the map was valid. Our implementations are available at https://github.com/xxdmw/FPGF-master.

In addition, a post-training satisfaction questionnaire was administered to participants of Group B and Group C. DESIGN The theoretical exam on CLP to determine their baseline level of knowledge was taken by the participants(T0). After the exam, the students were randomly divided into three groups and all students attended a lecture-based traditional education on CLP. Students in the first group (n = 40) received no additional teaching (Group A). Students in the second group (n = 38) received model teaching with 3D-printed models (Group B). The third group (n = 39) was trained in e-learning-supported education (Group C). The theoretical exam was repeated immediately after the education (T1/short-term learning), one week later (T2/early long-term learning), and one month later (T3/late long-term learning), and the effect of the education methods on information level was assessed. In addition, a post-training satisfaction questionnaire was administered to participants of Group B and Group C.Both 3D model-based and e-learning-supported approaches significantly improved immediate knowledge of CLP. However, no significant differences were found in knowledge retention over time between the all methods. A majority of students favored the incorporation of both methods in orthodontic education. RESULTS Both 3D model-based and e-learning-supported approaches significantly improved immediate knowledge of CLP. However, no significant differences were found in knowledge retention over time between the all methods. A majority of students favored the incorporation of both methods in orthodontic education.While both 3D models and e-learning effectively enhance short-term CLP knowledge among dental students, their long-term educational impacts are comparable. However, student preferences indicated that the use of 3D-printed models and e-learning strategies may be useful augmentations to traditional lecture education. CONCLUSIONS While both 3D models and e-learning effectively enhance short-term CLP knowledge among dental students, their long-term educational impacts are comparable. However, student preferences indicated that the use of 3D-printed models and e-learning strategies may be useful augmentations to traditional lecture education.

Abstract: Prerequisite courses have been a staple in admissions requirements for health programs for more than a century. Prerequisites serve various roles including achieving accreditation standards, determining academic preparation, predicting academic success, and informing admissions decisions. While the theories purported to support prerequisite courses have largely remained static, the challenges for educators and applicants have evolved. In addition to training future healthcare providers, contemporary educators are focused on attracting and training a diverse workforce as well as attaining enrollment targets to ensure financial stability. We propose 4 assumptions that pit common prerequisite practices against these contemporary challenges including limitations caused by the cost of prerequisites, disproportionate burden on underrepresented minorities, extraordinarily complex and variable policies, and a disconnect between grades and knowledge retention. Continuing to operate under these assumptions creates unnecessary barriers for potential students. We offer model practices for approaching prerequisites with more flexibility. These practices involve refining expectations for learning, normalizing alternatives to coursework, conducting prospective research, analyzing relevant data, and exploring more personalized pathways and holistic practices. As higher education changes and the demand for healthcare providers increases, innovation to the admissions process is needed to identify those who can complete programs and become competent healthcare providers.Prerequisite courses have been a staple in admissions requirements for health programs for more than a century.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of educational video games as a variety applied to the traditional teaching of pharmacology in topics of antifungal and hypolipidemic drugs. Sixty-six volunteers were divided into control group (n = 33) and experimental group (n = 33). The first group received traditional seminar only, and the second played video game designed with the use of Kahoot! platform after the seminar. The assessment of knowledge was conducted with the use of three tests: pre-test was presented before seminar, post-test after seminar (for control group) or after playing the video game (for experimental group), and test no. 3 took place 4 weeks later. Analysis of tests' scores with respect to both topics resulted in the observation that the control and experimental groups show statistically significant improvement in knowledge, whether it was measured after the seminar or 4 weeks later. However, the results of experimental group were statistically better in comparison to the control group. It proves that electronic GBL (game-based learning) applied to standard educational processes increases short- and long-term knowledge retention compared to traditional seminars.The aim of the study was to determine the usefulness of educational video games as a variety applied to the traditional teaching of pharmacology in topics of antifungal and hypolipidemic drugs.

Abstract: Integrating learning spacing in medicine has shown promise in enhancing knowledge retention and diagnostic proficiency. While studies demonstrate the effectiveness of spaced learning in various fields, limited research exists on its application in radiological training. This study aims to investigate the impact of intervals in spaced training on radiologists' and trainees' diagnostic performance via mammogram test sets. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES Integrating learning spacing in medicine has shown promise in enhancing knowledge retention and diagnostic proficiency. While studies demonstrate the effectiveness of spaced learning in various fields, limited research exists on its application in radiological training. This study aims to investigate the impact of intervals in spaced training on radiologists' and trainees' diagnostic performance via mammogram test sets.54 radiologists and 101 radiology trainees completed 207 and 458 first-time readings of 9 mammogram test sets between 2019 and 2023. Each test set comprised of 60 mammograms (20 cancer and 40 normal), sourced retrospectively from BreastScreen Australia. Each radiologist evaluated mammograms using the BIRADS lexicon. Readers' performance was compared with truth data and evaluated in terms of specificity, case sensitivity, lesion sensitivity, ROC AUC and JAFROC FOM. The progress of readers' performances in following test sets after the first one was analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The association of participants' performances and the intervals among test sets' completions was investigated using Pearson's test. METHODS 54 radiologists and 101 radiology trainees completed 207 and 458 first-time readings of 9 mammogram test sets between 2019 and 2023. Each test set comprised of 60 mammograms (20 cancer and 40 normal), sourced retrospectively from BreastScreen Australia. Each radiologist evaluated mammograms using the BIRADS lexicon. Readers' performance was compared with truth data and evaluated in terms of specificity, case sensitivity, lesion sensitivity, ROC AUC and JAFROC FOM. The progress of readers' performances in following test sets after the first one was analyzed using Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. The association of participants' performances and the intervals among test sets' completions was investigated using Pearson's test.Significant positive correlations were found between intervals and radiologists' improvement in specificity and JAFROC FOM (P < 0.05). The separation of 4 to 10 days showed the most improvement among radiologists across all metrics, while intervals exceeding 90 days related to highest increase in case sensitivity (5.15%), lesion sensitivity (6.55%), ROC AUC (3.05%) and JAFROC FOM (6.3%). Trainees completing test sets in one day showed positive correlations with their ROC AUC (R=0.45; P = 0.008) and JAFROC FOM (R=0.43; P = 0.02), while those taking a longer time to complete showed negative impacts on case sensitivity (P = 0.009) and ROC AUC (P = 0.02). Remarkable progress in trainees was found in case sensitivity (6.15%), lesion sensitivity (11.6%), ROC AUC (3.5%) and JAFROC FOM (4.35%) with test set intervals of 31-90 days. RESULTS Significant positive correlations were found between intervals and radiologists' improvement in specificity and JAFROC FOM (P < 0.05). The separation of 4 to 10 days showed the most improvement among radiologists across all metrics, while intervals exceeding 90 days related to highest increase in case sensitivity (5.15%), lesion sensitivity (6.55%), ROC AUC (3.05%) and JAFROC FOM (6.3%).

Remarkable progress in trainees was found in case sensitivity (6.15%), lesion sensitivity (11.6%), ROC AUC (3.5%) and JAFROC FOM (4.35%) with test set intervals of 31-90 days.Radiologists demonstrated superior performance when the training test sets were spaced over longer intervals, whereas trainees exhibited proficiency with shorter time separations. By optimizing the spacing of reviewing and practicing radiological concepts, mammogram readers can bolster memory retention and diagnostic decision-making skills. CONCLUSIONS Radiologists demonstrated superior performance when the training test sets were spaced over longer intervals, whereas trainees exhibited proficiency with shorter time separations. By optimizing the spacing of reviewing and practicing radiological concepts, mammogram readers can bolster memory retention and diagnostic decision-making skills.

Abstract: Performance assessments for student pharmacists are required by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education to monitor student knowledge, retention, and professional skill sets. Near the end of their Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs), fourth-year pharmacy students (P4s) at the University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy must pass a milestone exam (P4ME) to graduate. The P4ME contains four sections: adult medicine, ambulatory care, community, and hospital. If a student fails one or more sections of the initial multiple-choice P4ME, they must retake that specific section(s) on the makeup P4ME. If a student fails the makeup multiple-choice P4ME, they participate in a case based oral exam designed to determine whether they meet minimal competencies to pass the P4ME. This report outlines the process undertaken by the faculty to develop a high-stakes P4 milestone oral exam. While only a few students have participated in the process, outcomes differentiated P4s eligible for graduation versus those who needed to repeat an APPE. Lessons learned about the oral exam process include minimizing the number of faculty in attendance, shortening the exam duration, and standardizing the exam process. Positive aspects include remediation led by a subject matter expert and implementation of a unique rubric to assess student performance. Overall, the authors find the P4 oral milestone exam to be a feasible assessment tool for students who perform poorly on the initial and makeup multiple-choice P4MEs.Performance assessments for student pharmacists are required by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education to monitor student knowledge, retention, and professional skill sets.

Abstract: This study examined whether the order of podcast content influenced knowledge acquisition and retention among emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians. PURPOSE This study examined whether the order of podcast content influenced knowledge acquisition and retention among emergency medicine (EM) resident physicians.This preplanned secondary analysis of 2 large, multicenter trials included a randomized, crossover trial conducted from November 2019 to June 2020 of 100 residents that compared driving and seated condition for two 30-minute podcasts and a randomized, crossover trial conducted from September 2022 to January 2023 of 95 EM residents that compared exercise with seated condition for the same two 30-minute podcasts. Each podcast contained 6 journal article reviews, with the segments recorded in forward or backward order. After completing each podcast, participants completed an initial 20-question test and a 40-question delayed recall test with separate questions. Segments were divided into 3 subgroups based on the order in which they were played (primacy group, recency group, and reference group) for assessment of primacy and recency effects. The mean scaled scores from the primacy and recency groups were compared with scores from the reference group.

The mean scaled scores from the primacy and recency groups were compared with scores from the reference group.The study included 195 residents (390 podcasts), with 100 residents listening in the forward order and 95 residents the reverse order. No statistically significant difference was found in immediate recall scores between the primacy and reference groups (d = 0.094; 95% CI, -0.046 to 0.234) or the recency and reference groups (d = -0.041; 95% CI, -0.181 to 0.099) or in 30-day delayed recall score between the primacy and reference groups (d = -0.088; 95% CI, -0.232 to 0.056) or the recency and reference groups (d = -0.083; 95% CI, -0.227 to 0.060). RESULTS The study included 195 residents (390 podcasts), with 100 residents listening in the forward order and 95 residents the reverse order. No statistically significant difference was found in immediate recall scores between the primacy and reference groups (d = 0.094; 95% CI, -0.046 to 0.234) or the recency and reference groups (d = -0.041; 95% CI, -0.181 to 0.099) or in 30-day delayed recall score between the primacy and reference groups (d = -0.088; 95% CI, -0.232 to 0.056) or the recency and reference groups (d = -0.083; 95% CI, -0.227 to 0.060).The order of podcast information did not significantly affect immediate knowledge acquisition or delayed knowledge retention. This finding can inform podcast creators and listeners regarding the order of content when using podcasts for learning. CONCLUSIONS The order of podcast information did not significantly affect immediate knowledge acquisition or delayed knowledge retention. This finding can inform podcast creators and listeners regarding the order of content when using podcasts for learning.

Abstract: Knowledge maps are teaching tools that can promote deeply learning and avoid knowledge loss by helping students plan learning paths. Mining potential association rules of concepts from student exercise data was a common method to construct knowledge maps automatically. While manual conditions should be set to filter the association rules future to improve the accuracy of knowledge maps, which made the construction of the knowledge map can not automatic totally. So, the study proposed a knowledge map construction method that combined knowledge tracking and association rule mining expanding with interaction frequencies based on exercise data to achieve rules cleaning automatically. The method first predicted students’ knowledge mastery sequences by a deep knowledge tracking model and discovered clustering relations to represent potential structures between concepts by fuzzy cluster analysis. Meanwhile, the method investigated association rule mining expanding with interaction frequencies to discover association rules between concepts. Finally, the clustering relations were used to filter the mined association rules automatically. To verify the effectiveness of the method, we constructed a knowledge map based on 34,350 online exercise data of 117 students in a computer programming course. Experimental results proved that the map was valid. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Simulation-Based Learning (SBL) is increasingly adopted in medical education across various specialties, employing realistic simulations to significantly enhance learning experiences. However, a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness specifically in endocrinology has not yet been conducted. The study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the impact of SBL versus Non-Simulation-Based Learning (NSBL) on knowledge acquisition, skills, satisfaction, and interest in learning among endocrinology trainees. BACKGROUND Simulation-Based Learning (SBL) is increasingly adopted in medical education across various specialties, employing realistic simulations to significantly enhance learning experiences. However, a comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness specifically in endocrinology has not yet been conducted. The study aims to systematically review and meta-analyze the impact of SBL versus Non-Simulation-Based Learning (NSBL) on knowledge acquisition, skills, satisfaction, and interest in learning among endocrinology trainees.This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Weipu, and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) until March 2024. We included randomized controlled trials comparing SBL to NSBL in endocrinology education. The quality evaluation relied on the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool. The main results included evaluations from both theoretical and practical assessments. Additional measures consisted of assessing satisfaction and interest in learning. METHODS This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, Weipu, and Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) until March 2024. We included randomized controlled trials comparing SBL to NSBL in endocrinology education. The quality evaluation relied on the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool. The main results included evaluations from both theoretical and practical assessments. Additional measures consisted of assessing satisfaction and interest in learning.We identified 22 studies suitable for systematic review and 21 for meta-analysis, involving a total of 2517 participants. SBL greatly enhanced theoretical knowledge [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-1.32, P < 0.00001, I 2  = 89%] and practical skills (SMD = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.11-2.01, P < 0.00001, I 2  = 93%) compared to NSBL. Additionally, SBL was associated with higher satisfaction and greater interest in learning. No significant publication bias was detected, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these findings.

Additionally, SBL was associated with higher satisfaction and greater interest in learning. No significant publication bias was detected, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these findings.SBL significantly enhances knowledge, skills, satisfaction, and interest in learning within endocrinology education compared to NSBL. These findings support the integration of high-quality SBL into endocrinology curricula to improve educational outcomes. Future research should explore the lasting effects of SBL on knowledge retention and clinical practice, as well as to evaluate its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with various educational tools in diverse settings. CONCLUSIONS SBL significantly enhances knowledge, skills, satisfaction, and interest in learning within endocrinology education compared to NSBL. These findings support the integration of high-quality SBL into endocrinology curricula to improve educational outcomes. Future research should explore the lasting effects of SBL on knowledge retention and clinical practice, as well as to evaluate its cost-effectiveness and compatibility with various educational tools in diverse settings.

Abstract: The management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries necessitates surgical intervention, often involving procedures such as external fixation and percutaneous screw placement. Given the infrequent performance of these procedures, regular training is imperative to ensure readiness for emergencies. Our pre- post simulation study aimed to adapt and validate a realistic simulation model for stabilizing unstable pelvic ring injuries, facilitating participants' knowledge retention and procedural confidence enhancement. BACKGROUND The management of hemodynamically unstable pelvic ring injuries necessitates surgical intervention, often involving procedures such as external fixation and percutaneous screw placement. Given the infrequent performance of these procedures, regular training is imperative to ensure readiness for emergencies. Our pre- post simulation study aimed to adapt and validate a realistic simulation model for stabilizing unstable pelvic ring injuries, facilitating participants' knowledge retention and procedural confidence enhancement.A standardized simulator of an unstable pelvic ring utilizing synthetic pelvic bones featuring complete disruption of the symphysis and sacroiliac joint was developed. Trauma surgeons of a level one academic hospital were invited to perform external fixation and emergency sacroiliac screw application under C-arm guidance. Prior to and following the simulation session, participants completed a subjective questionnaire assessing their confidence in emergency interventions on a 10-point Likert scale (10-LS). Objective parameters, such as intraoperative imaging quality, reduction accuracy, and the positioning of screws, wires, and external fixators, were also evaluated as secondary outcome measures. METHODS A standardized simulator of an unstable pelvic ring utilizing synthetic pelvic bones featuring complete disruption of the symphysis and sacroiliac joint was developed. Trauma surgeons of a level one academic hospital were invited to perform external fixation and emergency sacroiliac screw application under C-arm guidance. Prior to and following the simulation session, participants completed a subjective questionnaire assessing their confidence in emergency interventions on a 10-point Likert scale (10-LS). Objective parameters, such as intraoperative imaging quality, reduction accuracy, and the positioning of screws, wires, and external fixators, were also evaluated as secondary outcome measures.Fifteen trauma surgeons (10 residents, 5 consultants) participated in the simulation over the course of one day. The mean total operation time was 20.34 ± 6.06 min, without significant differences between consultants and residents (p = 0.604). The confidence for emergency SI-Screw placement increased significantly after the simulator (10-LS: Before = 3.8 ± 3.08 vs. After = 5.67 ± 2.35; p = 0.002) as well as after external fixation (10-LS: Before = 3.93 ± 2.79 vs. After = 6.07 ± 2.52; p = 0.002). In addition, confidence in (intraoperative) pelvic imaging increased significantly (10-LS: Before = 4.60 ± 3.0 vs. After = 6.53 ± 2.39; p = 0.011). Overall, the model was rated as a realistic simulation of clinical practice (10-LS = 7.87 ± 1.13).

Participants benefitted from this in terms of technical instrumentation as well as intraoperative imaging. Further studies are required to validate the objective benefits and improvements that participants undergo through frequent training.

Abstract: To ensure whether spaced education, which increases long-term knowledge retention, could be integrated into auditor competency assessment. OBJECTIVE To ensure whether spaced education, which increases long-term knowledge retention, could be integrated into auditor competency assessment.Quality improvement project. DESIGN Quality improvement project.Academic, freestanding children's hospital. SETTING Academic, freestanding children's hospital.Hand hygiene (HH) auditors. PARTICIPANTS Hand hygiene (HH) auditors.We enrolled trained HH auditors in an online spaced-education platform to assess mastery of knowledge, delivering 46 unique questions at spaced intervals followed by rationale; we retired questions after 3 correct answers. An e-mailed 10-item survey gauged participant satisfaction with the program. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare change in median knowledge score from first to final attempt. INTERVENTION We enrolled trained HH auditors in an online spaced-education platform to assess mastery of knowledge, delivering 46 unique questions at spaced intervals followed by rationale; we retired questions after 3 correct answers. An e-mailed 10-item survey gauged participant satisfaction with the program. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare change in median knowledge score from first to final attempt.A total of 12,120 questions were attempted by 126 auditors, and 49 (39%) completed the entire course. Median knowledge score increased significantly by 10.5 percentage points (IQR 4-15) between first and final attempts ( P < 0.001). Thirty auditors (27%) responded to the survey. The majority agreed the number and complexity of questions were appropriate (57% and 67%, respectively). Eighty-seven percent reported the platform easy to navigate, and 77% agreed adequate time was provided for completion. Free-text suggestions included delivering fewer questions at a narrower spacing interval over a shorter time frame because of competing work demands. RESULTS A total of 12,120 questions were attempted by 126 auditors, and 49 (39%) completed the entire course. Median knowledge score increased significantly by 10.5 percentage points (IQR 4-15) between first and final attempts (P < 0.001). Thirty auditors (27%) responded to the survey.

Eighty-seven percent reported the platform easy to navigate, and 77% agreed adequate time was provided for completion. Free-text suggestions included delivering fewer questions at a narrower spacing interval over a shorter time frame because of competing work demands.Auditor knowledge of HH indications and technique is critical to ensuring data validity. A spaced-education competency program improved HH auditor knowledge in the short term. Completion rate was low, and some participants expressed a desire for fewer questions over a shorter time frame. This study offers insight into ways to optimize spaced education as a potential tool for HH competency assessment. CONCLUSIONS Auditor knowledge of HH indications and technique is critical to ensuring data validity. A spaced-education competency program improved HH auditor knowledge in the short term.

Abstract: Previous graduate students and postdoctoral associates from the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, in partnership with the University of Florida Student Science Training Program, implemented a cooperative learning curriculum, providing high school students with a broad overview of cancer topics over six weeks over the summer. To address discussions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic on student autonomy, we report lessons learned and outcomes of a cancer biology and therapeutic curriculum modified for a collaborative learning environment. BACKGROUND Previous graduate students and postdoctoral associates from the University of Florida Health Cancer Center, in partnership with the University of Florida Student Science Training Program, implemented a cooperative learning curriculum, providing high school students with a broad overview of cancer topics over six weeks over the summer. To address discussions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic on student autonomy, we report lessons learned and outcomes of a cancer biology and therapeutic curriculum modified for a collaborative learning environment.This pre-post longitudinal observational study conducted in 2023 on a cancer biology and therapeutics course evaluated students' knowledge retention and general awareness and opinions in cancer research. A structured survey was employed for data collection, using learning assessment surveys and the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 being highly likely. METHODS This pre-post longitudinal observational study conducted in 2023 on a cancer biology and therapeutics course evaluated students' knowledge retention and general awareness and opinions in cancer research. A structured survey was employed for data collection, using learning assessment surveys and the Likert scale ranging from 1 to 10, with 10 being highly likely.Student performance tracked over a 7-year period indicated consistency in performance between years. Post-assessment analysis revealed significant improvements in student benchmark understanding, notably in their ability to define cancer in one sentence (p = 0.0407), identify cancer therapies (p = 0.0040), and recognize cancer hallmarks (p < 0.0001). An increased trend in median response to the likelihood of pursuing cancer research (p = 0.8793) and the possibility of pursuing cancer research (p = 0.4874) were also observed, although not statistically significant. Moreover, feedback from participating students indicated that "the educational activities at the end of class (e.g., escape room, case studies)" and "learning about cancer and getting to work in groups…" the curriculum fostered a positive educational learning environment.

Incorporating opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, especially when introducing or discussing complex issues like cancer, may benefit student autotomy. CONCLUSION Students generally retained the course material presented and upheld a positive perception of the course. Incorporating opportunities for peer-to-peer learning, especially when introducing or discussing complex issues like cancer, may benefit student autotomy.

Abstract: Medical education offers the foundational base for future healthcare professionals, with basic sciences playing a pivotal role in providing essential knowledge and skills for clinical practice. However, the long-term retention and application of this knowledge in clinical practice remain a significant challenge. This systematic review synthesised global evidence from diverse studies on the short / long-term retention and clinical application of basic sciences among medical doctors. BACKGROUND Medical education offers the foundational base for future healthcare professionals, with basic sciences playing a pivotal role in providing essential knowledge and skills for clinical practice. However, the long-term retention and application of this knowledge in clinical practice remain a significant challenge. This systematic review synthesised global evidence from diverse studies on the short / long-term retention and clinical application of basic sciences among medical doctors.A comprehensive search was conducted across six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, Emcare, and Informit. The review included studies that encompassed a variety of study designs, participant groups, and educational interventions. The Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was utilised to assess the quality of the reviewed studies. METHODS A comprehensive search was conducted across six databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, CINAHL, Emcare, and Informit. The review included studies that encompassed a variety of study designs, participant groups, and educational interventions. The Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies (QuADS) tool was utilised to assess the quality of the reviewed studies.A total of 10 studies were included in the review. The findings revealed that rehearsals significantly optimise the retention of basic science knowledge among medical practitioners. Retention varied by discipline, with medical practitioners retaining more knowledge in anatomy (mean scores ranging from 45.0 to 82.9%), while microbiology had the lowest retention score (39.1%). Factors influencing retention included age, gender, and curriculum type. Educational interventions such as targeted courses, integration of basic sciences with clinical skills, generative retrieval and continuous quality improvement in the curriculum were found to enhance both knowledge retention and clinical reasoning. The concept of 'encapsulated knowledge' demonstrates that integrated basic science knowledge helps in synthesising clinical presentations, reducing the need for detailed recall as clinical experience increases. The reviewed studies primarily involved interns and surgeons, leaving a significant gap in research for specialties like internal medicine and primary care/ general practice. RESULTS A total of 10 studies were included in the review. The findings revealed that rehearsals significantly optimise the retention of basic science knowledge among medical practitioners. Retention varied by discipline, with medical practitioners retaining more knowledge in anatomy (mean scores ranging from 45.0 to 82.9%), while microbiology had the lowest retention score (39.1%). Factors influencing retention included age, gender, and curriculum type. Educational interventions such as targeted courses, integration of basic sciences with clinical skills, generative retrieval and continuous quality improvement in the curriculum were found to enhance both knowledge retention and clinical reasoning. The concept of 'encapsulated knowledge' demonstrates that integrated basic science knowledge helps in synthesising clinical presentations, reducing the need for detailed recall as clinical experience increases. The reviewed studies primarily involved interns and surgeons, leaving a significant gap in research for specialties like internal medicine and primary care/ general practice.Detailed retention of basic science knowledge may diminish over time; however, the conceptual framework remains essential for ongoing learning and clinical reasoning. This review's findings highlight the need for specialised educational interventions to improve long-term retention. Continuous professional development and targeted educational techniques are vital for maintaining clinical competence and applying basic science knowledge effectively throughout a medical career. Further research is needed to address gaps in specialty-specific knowledge application and the impact of different instructional methods. CONCLUSION Detailed retention of basic science knowledge may diminish over time; however, the conceptual framework remains essential for ongoing learning and clinical reasoning. This review's findings highlight the need for specialised educational interventions to improve long-term retention. Continuous professional development and targeted educational techniques are vital for maintaining clinical competence and applying basic science knowledge effectively throughout a medical career.

Abstract: The Sto. Niño site in Benguet province, Philippines was once a mining area that has now been transformed into an agricultural land. In this area, there has been significant integration of the three indigenous people (IPs) Ibaloi, Kankanaeys and Kalanguyas with the Ilocano community. These IPs safeguard biodiversity and traditional knowledge, including medicinal plant use. However, the documentation of these plant species and their medicinal applications has not been systematic, with the resultant loss of knowledge across generations. This study aims to document the medicinal and ritual plants used by the indigenous communities at the site, in order to preserve and disseminate traditional medicinal knowledge that would otherwise be lost.

This study aims to document the medicinal and ritual plants used by the indigenous communities at the site, in order to preserve and disseminate traditional medicinal knowledge that would otherwise be lost.Ethnobotanical data were collected in Sto. Niño, Brgy. Ambassador, Municipality of Tublay, Benguet, Philippines, and collected through semi-structured interviews, together with focus group discussions (FGD). A total of 100 residents (39 male and 61 female) were interviewed. Among them, 12 were key interviewees, including community elders and farmers, while the rest were selected through the convenience and snowball technique. Demographic information collected from the interviewees included age, gender, and occupation. Ethnobotanical information collected focused on medicinal plants, including the specific parts of plants used, methods of preparation, modes of treatment, and the types of ailments treated. Ethnobotanical quantitative indices of the relative frequency of citations (RFC) and informant consensus factor (ICF) were calculated to evaluate the plant species that were utilized by the community.

Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Lamiaceae (10.71%) family are the most mentioned medicinal plant species, followed by Myrtaceae and Euphorbiaceae (7.14%). The most widely used growth form were herbs (46.4%), while leaves (61.5%) were the most utilized plant part, and the preparation of a decoction (62.2%) was the most preferred method of processing and application. The medicinal plants were most commonly utilized for wound-healing, cough and colds, stomachache and kidney trouble, whereas ritual plants were largely used for healing, protection, and funeral ceremonies.

Abstract: The misuse and overuse of antibiotics accelerate the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Serious games, any form of games that serve a greater purpose other than entertainment, could augment public education above ongoing health promotion efforts. Hence, we developed an evidence-based educational serious game app-SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence-to educate players on good antibiotic use practices and AMR through a game quest comprising 3 minigames and interaction with the nonplayer characters. BACKGROUND The misuse and overuse of antibiotics accelerate the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Serious games, any form of games that serve a greater purpose other than entertainment, could augment public education above ongoing health promotion efforts. Hence, we developed an evidence-based educational serious game app-SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence-to educate players on good antibiotic use practices and AMR through a game quest comprising 3 minigames and interaction with the nonplayer characters.We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence app in improving the knowledge of, attitude toward, and perceptions (KAP) of appropriate antibiotic use and AMR among the public in Singapore. OBJECTIVE We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence app in improving the knowledge of, attitude toward, and perceptions (KAP) of appropriate antibiotic use and AMR among the public in Singapore.We conducted a 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial, recruiting visitors aged 18-65 years from 2 polyclinics in Singapore. Intervention group participants had to download the SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence app (available only in English and on the Android platform) on their smartphones and complete the quest in the app. Participants took half a day to 2 weeks to complete the quest. The control group received no intervention. Knowledge questions on antibiotic use and AMR (11 binary questions) were self-administered at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 6-10 weeks post intervention, while attitudes and perception questions (14 three-point Likert-scale questions) were self-administered at baseline and 6-10 weeks post intervention. We also collected participants' feedback on app usage. METHODS We conducted a 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial, recruiting visitors aged 18-65 years from 2 polyclinics in Singapore.

We also collected participants' feedback on app usage.Participants (n=348; intervention: n=142, control: n=206) had a mean age of 36.9 years. Intervention group participants showed a statistically significant improvement in mean knowledge score (effect size: 0.58 [95% CI 0.28-0.87]) compared with controls after accounting for age, educational level, and exposure to advertisements on antibiotics and AMR. Intervention participants also showed a statistically significant improvement in mean attitude-perception scores (effect size: 0.98 (95% CI 0.44-1.52)) after adjusting for marital status and race. A majority of participants agreed that the "SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence" app improved their awareness on antibiotic use (135/142, 95.1%) and AMR (136/142, 95.8%). About 73.9% (105/142) of the participants agreed that the app is easy to use, 70.4% (100/142) agreed that the app was enjoyable, and 85.2% (121/142) would recommend the app to others.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effects of Storytelling Narrated Videos (SNV) on students’ knowledge retention and transferability. A total of 56 students from a university in Indonesia were randomly assigned to a quasi-experimental research design exposed to SNV and to Lecture Narrated Videos (LNV). Two videos were created to deliver content on Bloom’s Taxonomy, one using a lecture-style format and the other adopting a storytelling approach. Data were collected through tests, questionnaires, and essays. The findings revealed that participants exposed to SNV had higher retention memory scores, indicating a positive impact on knowledge retention compared to those who watched LNV. Moreover, the storytelling videos facilitated cognitive skill progression, enhanced understanding through engaging visuals, and fostered a strong connection with a familiar narrator, resulting in a more dynamic and memorable learning experience. The study also examined knowledge transfer and found that participants who watched the storytelling videos performed better in applying Bloom’s Taxonomy concepts to planning teaching objectives in the essay test. This suggests that the incorporation of storytelling narration and promoting transfer knowledge activities can enhance students’ understanding, retention, and practical application of the learned material. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of incorporating storytelling in narrated videos to improve students’ knowledge retention, transferability, and engagement in educational settings. Alternate abstract: Plain language summary The impact of digital storytelling on students’ learning and knowledge transfer This research aimed to explore how using Storytelling Narrated Videos (SNV) affects students’ memory and ability to apply what they’ve learned. The study involved 56 students from an Indonesian university who were randomly assigned to either watch SNV or Lecture Narrated Videos (LNV). Two different videos were created to teach about Bloom’s Taxonomy—one presented information in a traditional lecture style, while the other used storytelling. Data were collected through tests, questionnaires, and essays. Results showed that students who watched SNV had better memory scores, suggesting that storytelling videos helped them remember information better compared to those who watched LNV. Additionally, storytelling videos helped students improve their thinking skills, made the content more understandable with engaging visuals, and created a stronger connection with the narrator, resulting in a more interesting and memorable learning experience. The study also looked at whether students could use what they learned in practical situations, and found that those who watched storytelling videos performed better in applying Bloom’s Taxonomy concepts in the essay test. This indicates that using storytelling in videos and encouraging students to apply what they learn can improve their understanding, memory, and ability to use the information in real-life scenarios.

Abstract: Abundant research has tried to understand how games can be designed and used effectively to improve the learning process and to examine the correlations between digital learning games and student motivation, engagement, and knowledge retention. The current study examined the correlation between learning through digital game-based learning (DGBL) and students’ achievements, their sense of involvement, and motivation for learning. Using a quantitative approach, data was drawn from questionnaires and exams in two subjects: literature and language. Participants were 320 male and female students aged 12–14 attending a single middle school participated in the study. The students were randomly divided into three groups, each group was given a unique teaching and learning method. Group 1 studied and practiced using the traditional method (a teacher who teaches in the classroom and worksheets for practice), Group 2 studied with the traditional method but practiced with a digital game and Group 3 learned and practiced using a digital game. The findings showed that the students’ attained significantly higher achievements in the group that was taught traditionally but practiced with a digital game. It was also found that when digital learning games are integrated into teaching and learning, the students’ motivation and involvement in the class increased.

Abstract: Supplemental instruction (SI) confers student success, as represented by grades, knowledge retention, and student engagement. However, studies often report professional, not undergraduate, program findings. To measure these effects, students studying human anatomy at a university in Ontario, Canada, attended structured (peer‐assisted) or unstructured (nonpeer‐assisted) SI sessions and completed a pre−/post‐survey. Fifty‐eight learners (39 systems (SYS) and 19 musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy) completed both surveys and had responses analyzed. Both cohorts, maintained initial perceptions across pre−/post‐analyses (MSK p = 0.1376 and SYS p = 0.3521). Resource usage was similar across both cohorts with discrepancies in skeletal model and textbook use. No MSK learner ranked any lab resources as “not at all useful.” MSK learners felt more prepared to write a graded assessment ( p = 0.0269), whereas SYS learners did not ( p = 0.0680). Stratification of learners in MSK and SYS revealed learners spending between 30 and 60 min in SI sessions during the study period had the highest grades compared to students who spent less than 30 ( p = 0.0286) or more than 60 ( p = 0.0286) min attending SI sessions, respectively. Most learners in MSK (89.4%) and SYS (66%) concluded that they preferred structured over unstructured SI. Sentiment/thematic analysis using a generative AI‐driven large language model revealed learners held positive perceptions of SI, emphasizing structured learning, resources, personalized learning, and support offered as the most prevalent themes surrounding SI. Ultimately, this study provides evidence that supports SI for improving student outcomes related to perceived preparedness for completing assessments and preferred teaching/learning styles in undergraduate human anatomy.

Abstract: Background Didactic lectures form a large part of the teaching-learning process in medical education. To impart competency-based medical education (CBME) in the Covid-19 pandemic there was a shift to online learning. This pedagogical change would likely impact the efficacy of student learning outcomes. Several studies have shown that learning outcomes and knowledge retention increase considerably when lectures are interactive. However, the efficacy of online teaching with active learning strategies has not been studied. Methods At the Department of Biochemistry, Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad, we did this study with 203 first year MBBS students. Five sessions were conducted on the topic of 'Enzymology' with appropriate active learning methods. Each lecture session was preceded and followed by a test, which included multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and brief note questions (BNQs). Feedback of students, was recorded on the 5-point Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. Results The majority of students felt that answering questions in the pre-test required substantial effort compared to the post-test. The case scenarios included in the pre-test had a positive impact on the curiosity of students. The activities as part of self-directed learning were interesting, and enhanced understanding and retention. They felt lectures without pre-and post-tests were less efficacious and thus should be continued in all the classes. Conclusion Online lectures without pre-and post-test model were less efficacious. Online teaching, coupled with active learning increased interest and the understanding capacity of students.Background Didactic lectures form a large part of the teaching-learning process in medical education.

Abstract: Most state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in South Africa face serious challenges with tacit knowledge loss risks, largely due to a lack of alignment and integration points for human resource management (HRM) practices in knowledge management to effectively manage such knowledge loss risks. This study was interdisciplinary in nature, presenting empirical evidence of a strong connection between HRM and knowledge management (KM), especially its knowledge risk management (KRM) sub-domain. The research paper employed a qualitative research design, which involved collecting in-depth qualitative data through interviews with 20 human resource (HR) managers in 9 SOEs. The qualitative data extracted through the interviews were analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti software. The research results revealed that HRM practices are not aligned, integrated and focused on mitigating enterprise tacit knowledge loss risks in most South African SOEs. A lack of HRM alignment and integration was a serious issue across the board, irrespective of whether the participating SOEs had knowledge management structures, roles and strategies in place. However, on a positive note, HR managers acknowledged the need for the integration and alignment of HRM strategies regarding effective knowledge loss risk management. The study highlights a deficiency in HRM alignment and integration for effective knowledge loss risk management. The researcher infers that HRM alignment and integration in KRM has a critical strategic and operational role to play in the mitigation of enterprise knowledge risks, as well as in developing the required knowledge management capabilities. The study sought to close a knowledge gap in the existing body of knowledge by presenting empirical evidence identifying alignment and integration points of HRM strategies into KRM for SOEs to effectively reduce knowledge loss risks. Furthermore, the study presents a strong link between HRM and KRM in building KM capacity for the reduction of the risks associated with tacit knowledge loss.

Abstract: Hong Kong S.A.R., China is one of the most economically prosperous areas in the world, with numerous multinational companies (MNCs) operating here. It is of vital importance for MNCs to leverage their knowledge across the entire organization, including both the head office and overseas branches. However, many MNCs struggle with knowledge transfer across borders due to the differences in national cultural and institutional factors. Therefore, this research seeks to explore these factors affecting knowledge transfer in MNCs in the Hong Kong S.A.R., China. Six semi-structured interviews with professional practitioners were carried out. Knowledge is transferred in MNCs mainly by three processes, namely, on-the-job training, knowledge-sharing sessions, and knowledge retention of leaving employees. Cultural differences including language differences, geography differences and power distance, technical factors, and institutional differences, including organizational structure differences, senior management support, and employee motivation do affect knowledge transfer of MNCs. This study adds new insights into knowledge transfer issues across the boundaries of MNCs in Hong Kong. It provides significant managerial implications that are helpful to these multinational organizations to achieve effective knowledge management in the global context to overcome cultural and institutional obstacles.

Abstract: Conversational Artificial Intelligence has disrupted higher education by fundamentally altering its landscape. Fuelled by natural language processing and machine learning this technology has gained widespread adoption particularly since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. As universities embrace digital transformation, assessment practices must evolve to align with the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence-driven chatbots and virtual assistants. This paper explores how conversational artificial intelligence impacts higher education, in particular, student assessment. A fundamental shift in assessment and evaluation of student competencies is necessary to not only consider knowledge retention but also critical thinking, communication, and adaptability skills. A review of the literature was conducted to understand how assignments should change due to the emergence of this disruptive technology. Conversational Artificial Intelligence and its application within the higher education context is uncertain, with disparate practices-in terms of ethical consideration and understanding-across the sector. A case study was conducted in which MSc Management students undertaking a specific module were tasked to use three Artificial Intelligence tools in their report writing of a business, to verify the sources and content provided by the Artificial Intelligence tool, and to critically evaluate the process as well as the output received for each prompt. The paper proposes a collaborative approach to navigate the ethical implementation and utilization of conversational Artificial Intelligence in higher education, advocating for the co-creation of guidelines through forums like Knowledge Cafés, stressing the need to rethink student assignments and its assessment and the adoption of artificial intelligence technologies by students for assignments.

Abstract: High-resolution displays on mobile devices, accurate motion sensors, and efficient mobile processors have taken virtual reality (VR), essentially employed in laboratory, to everyday environments, including homes, workplaces, and classrooms. Regarding programming education, it has been investigated in conjunction with various educational strategies, such as block-based programming (BBP), metaphors, and storytelling. However, studies that adopt VR predominantly employ high-end head-mounted displays (HMDs) and powerful computers to deliver interactive and immersive learning experiences. Conversely, investigations involving mobile platforms and low-cost HMDs often lack user interactivity. Towards filling that gap, this study introduces SSPOT-VR (Space Station for Programming Training in Virtual Reality), a cost-effective solution tailored for children and teenagers that integrates interactive methods for the teaching and learning of programming concepts and the simulated experience of an immersive digitally created world. Three surveys, namely S 1 , S 2 and S 3 , involving SSPOT-VR and K-12 students were conducted. S 1 and S 2 focused on user acceptance ( n 1 = 124 and n 2 = 16 ) and S 3 centered on knowledge retention ( n 3 = 31 ). The results indicate students are inclined to accept SSPOT-VR as a valuable educational tool, since it effectively facilitates the retention of programming knowledge through its engaging and interactive learning experiences. By choosing more cost-effective equipment, this research supports the existing body of knowledge while also providing a detailed description of how an effective solution is designed, developed, and used. The approach enhances both affordability and potential applications of immersive VR in programming education.

Abstract: Background The transition from theoretical knowledge to clinical competency in operative dentistry is an ongoing challenge in dental education. Undergraduate students often face a significant gap between understanding theory and applying practical skills for diagnosing and preparing cavities, which leads to decreased confidence, increased stress, and potential errors in clinical practice. Case-based learning (CBL), an active learning strategy that emphasizes real-world scenarios, has shown promise for improving clinical skills and knowledge retention in other healthcare disciplines. This pilot study explored the potential of CBL to address the theory-practice gap and enhance confidence among undergraduate dental students in performing cavity preparations. Methods This pilot study utilized a pre and post-intervention design and involved 30 second-year dental students. Participants completed confidence surveys at three points: before CBL activity, immediately after CBL activity, and following their first clinical cavity preparation procedure. The CBL activity consisted of two components: interactive case discussions and hands-on laboratory exercises designed to simulate real-world dental procedures. The interactive discussions focused on diagnostic and treatment planning while laboratory exercises provided practical experience in cavity preparation. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the changes in confidence levels across the three survey points. Results CBL significantly increased students' confidence across multiple dimensions (p < 0.05). Confidence in modifying cavity preparations increased from a mean of 2.91 (SD = 0.292) before CBL to 5.12 (SD = 0.331) post-CBL and further to 5.52 (SD = 0.556) after clinical practice. Similarly, confidence in understanding the basic concepts of caries removal improved from 4.82 (SD = 0.528) pre-CBL to 5.45 (SD = 0.564) post-CBL, and to 5.61 (SD = 0.556) post-clinic. However, confidence in performing cavity preparations without faculty guidance remained relatively low, increasing from a baseline mean of 2.67 (SD = 0.478) to 2.91 (SD = 0.384) post-CBL and 3.64 (SD = 0.603) post-clinic. Conclusion Incorporating CBL into the curriculum can significantly improve undergraduate students' confidence in performing cavity preparation. This approach may help bridge the theory-practice gap and better prepare students for the clinical environment. This pilot study provides promising initial data, and further research is needed to determine the long-term impact of CBL and the optimal implementation strategies.Background The transition from theoretical knowledge to clinical competency in operative dentistry is an ongoing challenge in dental education.

Abstract: Aims This study aimed to evaluate the long‐term results of Japan Maternal Emergency Life‐Saving (J‐MELS) simulation training on obstetric healthcare providers, over a 12‐month follow‐up period. Methods A total of 273 trainees from 17 J‐MELS Basic courses conducted between August 2021 and October 2023 were included. The trainees' responses to the pre‐ and post‐tests, questionnaires, and self‐reports on the usefulness of the J‐MELS scenarios in actual clinical settings at 1, 6, and 12 months after the training were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also conducted to identify the factors influencing knowledge retention. Results We found an overall improvement in clinical knowledge acquisition after J‐MELS training and a significant retention of this improvement at least until 12 months later. However, these scores gradually declined over. Trainees reported increased usefulness of J‐MELS scenarios in actual clinical practice at 1, 6, and 12 months after training, particularly in managing obstetric emergencies such as atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Knowledge retention was influenced by several specific factors, such as years of clinical experience, affiliated institutions, qualifications, and especially pre‐test scores. Conclusion Our longitudinal follow‐up study demonstrated, for the first time, the long‐term results of J‐MELS simulation training using post‐tests and self‐report data.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nursing education, rooted in conventional methods like didactic lectures and clinical experiences, is evolving to incorporate innovative learning strategies. This study delves into the effectiveness of mind mapping, an interactive technique, in enhancing information retrieval skills among nursing students. Departing from linear note-taking, mind maps visually organize information, aligning with contemporary learning theories emphasizing visual and interactive modalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methodologically, a quasi-experimental design with a crossover intervention was employed, involving 144 nursing students in Pune City, Maharashtra; the time taken to conduct the study was 2 months. The study focused on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and chronic renal failure (CRF), employing pre-tests, post-tests, and long-term retention assessments. RESULTS: Results indicated significantly higher knowledge gains and retention with mind mapping, substantiated by effect size analyses. Student perceptions, assessed through a Likert scale, revealed widespread agreement on mind mapping’s clarity, effectiveness, and positive impact on understanding and retention. Challenges included the need for faculty and student training, highlighting the importance of integration and support in educational institutions. CONCLUSION: This study explores the effectiveness of mind mapping as a learning technique in nursing education, aiming to enhance knowledge acquisition, retention, and critical thinking skills, departing from traditional approaches. Results indicate that mind mapping significantly improves knowledge retention compared to conventional methods. Hence, we strongly recommend mind mapping as an integral learning technique in nursing education; this will impact on enhancing knowledge acquisition, retention, and critical thinking skills among nursing students, surpassing the outcomes of traditional methods.

Abstract: Students increasingly carry out learning activities in online learning spaces, but they suffer from the problem of insufficient teacher guidance and emotional support. Pedagogical agents are able to communicate with learners in different roles and interactions which to a certain extent can make up for the shortcomings of online learning spaces. To further enhance the teaching effectiveness of pedagogical agents, this study explored the effects of pedagogical agents’ role type and voice emotional design on learners’ learning outcomes (knowledge retention / transfer) and learning process (learning interest / academic emotion / cognitive load / intimacy / social presence / learning experience). Our study tested the interaction effects of two pedagogical agents’ images (teacher role/peer role) and two pedagogical agents’ voices (traditional synthesized voices/emotional synthesized voices) using a sample of 206 s grade students. The results show that the emotional design of voice does not have an obvious impact in relieving students’ emotional stress and improving their learning process and outcomes, however the interaction effect of peer role and voice emotional design does have clear advantages. The emotional design of voice may increase learners’ extrinsic cognitive load, therefore this design should try to minimize the extrinsic cognitive load, pay attention to guiding learners’ intrinsic cognitive load, and promote the related cognitive load. Meanwhile, in the design process of pedagogical agents, we should work to enhance intimacy and learning experience, rendering pleasurable emotions which will lessen learners’ anxiety and boredom through the emotional design of role types and voices. To conclude, the interaction effect of character and emotional voice has a practical application prospect only when utilized with the appropriate role type and reasonable voice emotionalization design.

Abstract: In recent years, online education platforms have seen rapid growth, attracting an increasing number of students to digital learning environments. In online education, learners can choose learning content and plan their own learning path more freely. Although the online education platform gives learners a high degree of freedom, it reduces the learning guidance for learners, which leads to problems such as "information overload" and "knowledge loss". The main manifestation is that learners don't know how to plan their learning path, resulting in reduced learning efficiency and poor learning effects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a learning path recommendation algorithm based on reinforcement learning called RLLP. The RLLP model takes into account the learner's learning goals, knowledge level, and the relationships between knowledge points. Simultaneously, it also considers the smoothness of the learning path and the learner's engagement, aiming to recommend efficient and sensible learning paths to learners. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLLP model.

Abstract: Supplemental instruction (SI) confers student success, as represented by grades, knowledge retention, and student engagement. However, studies often report professional, not undergraduate, program findings. To measure these effects, students studying human anatomy at a university in Ontario, Canada, attended structured (peer‐assisted) or unstructured (nonpeer‐assisted) SI sessions and completed a pre−/post‐survey. Fifty‐eight learners (39 systems (SYS) and 19 musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy) completed both surveys and had responses analyzed. Both cohorts, maintained initial perceptions across pre−/post‐analyses (MSK p  = 0.1376 and SYS p  = 0.3521). Resource usage was similar across both cohorts with discrepancies in skeletal model and textbook use. No MSK learner ranked any lab resources as “not at all useful.” MSK learners felt more prepared to write a graded assessment ( p  = 0.0269), whereas SYS learners did not ( p  = 0.0680). Stratification of learners in MSK and SYS revealed learners spending between 30 and 60 min in SI sessions during the study period had the highest grades compared to students who spent less than 30 ( p  = 0.0286) or more than 60 ( p  = 0.0286) min attending SI sessions, respectively. Most learners in MSK (89.4%) and SYS (66%) concluded that they preferred structured over unstructured SI. Sentiment/thematic analysis using a generative AI‐driven large language model revealed learners held positive perceptions of SI, emphasizing structured learning, resources, personalized learning, and support offered as the most prevalent themes surrounding SI. Ultimately, this study provides evidence that supports SI for improving student outcomes related to perceived preparedness for completing assessments and preferred teaching/learning styles in undergraduate human anatomy.

Abstract: High-stakes examinations enjoy widespread use as summative assessments in higher education. We review the arguments for and against their use, across seven common themes: memory recall and knowledge retention; student motivation and learning; authenticity and real-world relevance; validity and reliability; academic misconduct and contract cheating; stress, anxiety and wellbeing; and fairness and equity. For each theme, we evaluate empirical evidence for the perceived pedagogical benefits and pedagogical drawbacks of high-stakes examinations. We find that relatively few of the perceived academic benefits of high-stakes examinations have a strong evidence base. Support for their use is largely rooted in opinion and pragmatism, rather than being justified by scientific evidence or pedagogical merit. By contrast, there is substantial evidence for pedagogical drawbacks of high-stakes summative examinations. We conclude that the current heavy reliance on high-stakes final examinations in many university subjects is poorly justified by the balance of empirical evidence.

Abstract: While graphics are commonly used by clinicians to communicate information to patients, the impact of using visual media on surgical patients is not understood. This review seeks to understand the current landscape of research analyzing impact of using visual aids to communicate with patients undergoing surgery, as well as gaps in the present literature. OBJECTIVE While graphics are commonly used by clinicians to communicate information to patients, the impact of using visual media on surgical patients is not understood. This review seeks to understand the current landscape of research analyzing impact of using visual aids to communicate with patients undergoing surgery, as well as gaps in the present literature.A comprehensive literature search was performed across 4 databases. Search terms included: visual aids, diagrams, graphics, surgery, patient education, informed consent, and decision making. Inclusion criteria were (i) full-text, peer-reviewed articles in English; (ii) evaluation of a nonelectronic visual aid(s); and (iii) surgical patient population. DESIGN A comprehensive literature search was performed across 4 databases. Search terms included: visual aids, diagrams, graphics, surgery, patient education, informed consent, and decision making. Inclusion criteria were (i) full-text, peer-reviewed articles in English; (ii) evaluation of a nonelectronic visual aid(s); and (iii) surgical patient population.There were 1402 articles identified; 21 met study criteria. Fifteen were randomized control trials and 6 were prospective cohort studies. Visual media assessed comprised of diagrams as informed consent adjuncts (n = 6), graphics for shared decision-making conversations (n = 3), other preoperative educational graphics (n = 8), and postoperative educational materials (n = 4). There was statistically significant improvement in patient comprehension, with an increase in objective knowledge recall (7.8%-29.6%) using illustrated educational materials (n = 10 of 15). Other studies noted increased satisfaction (n = 4 of 6), improvement in shared decision-making (n = 2 of 4), and reduction in patient anxiety (n = 3 of 6). For behavioral outcomes, visual aids improved postoperative medication compliance (n = 2) and lowered postoperative analgesia requirements (n = 2). RESULTS There were 1402 articles identified; 21 met study criteria. Fifteen were randomized control trials and 6 were prospective cohort studies. Visual media assessed comprised of diagrams as informed consent adjuncts (n = 6), graphics for shared decision-making conversations (n = 3), other preoperative educational graphics (n = 8), and postoperative educational materials (n = 4).

For behavioral outcomes, visual aids improved postoperative medication compliance (n = 2) and lowered postoperative analgesia requirements (n = 2).The use of visual aids to enhance the surgical patient experience is promising in improving knowledge retention, satisfaction, and reducing anxiety. Future studies ought to consider visual aid format, and readability, as well as patient language, race, and healthcare literacy. CONCLUSIONS The use of visual aids to enhance the surgical patient experience is promising in improving knowledge retention, satisfaction, and reducing anxiety. Future studies ought to consider visual aid format, and readability, as well as patient language, race, and healthcare literacy.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of Japan Maternal Emergency Life-Saving (J-MELS) simulation training on obstetric healthcare providers, over a 12-month follow-up period. AIMS This study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of Japan Maternal Emergency Life-Saving (J-MELS) simulation training on obstetric healthcare providers, over a 12-month follow-up period.A total of 273 trainees from 17 J-MELS Basic courses conducted between August 2021 and October 2023 were included. The trainees' responses to the pre- and post-tests, questionnaires, and self-reports on the usefulness of the J-MELS scenarios in actual clinical settings at 1, 6, and 12 months after the training were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also conducted to identify the factors influencing knowledge retention. METHODS A total of 273 trainees from 17 J-MELS Basic courses conducted between August 2021 and October 2023 were included. The trainees' responses to the pre- and post-tests, questionnaires, and self-reports on the usefulness of the J-MELS scenarios in actual clinical settings at 1, 6, and 12 months after the training were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was also conducted to identify the factors influencing knowledge retention.We found an overall improvement in clinical knowledge acquisition after J-MELS training and a significant retention of this improvement at least until 12 months later. However, these scores gradually declined over. Trainees reported increased usefulness of J-MELS scenarios in actual clinical practice at 1, 6, and 12 months after training, particularly in managing obstetric emergencies such as atonic postpartum hemorrhage. Knowledge retention was influenced by several specific factors, such as years of clinical experience, affiliated institutions, qualifications, and especially pre-test scores. RESULTS We found an overall improvement in clinical knowledge acquisition after J-MELS training and a significant retention of this improvement at least until 12 months later. However, these scores gradually declined over.

Our findings provide valuable insight into the impact of J-MELS simulation training on maternal emergency care. By elucidating the factors influencing knowledge retention and practical utility, the findings offer actionable recommendations for optimizing training strategies and improving maternal outcomes in actual clinical practice.

Abstract: Supplemental instruction (SI) confers student success, as represented by grades, knowledge retention, and student engagement. However, studies often report professional, not undergraduate, program findings. To measure these effects, students studying human anatomy at a university in Ontario, Canada, attended structured (peer-assisted) or unstructured (nonpeer-assisted) SI sessions and completed a pre-/post-survey. Fifty-eight learners (39 systems (SYS) and 19 musculoskeletal (MSK) anatomy) completed both surveys and had responses analyzed. Both cohorts, maintained initial perceptions across pre-/post-analyses (MSK p = 0.1376 and SYS p = 0.3521). Resource usage was similar across both cohorts with discrepancies in skeletal model and textbook use. No MSK learner ranked any lab resources as "not at all useful." MSK learners felt more prepared to write a graded assessment (p = 0.0269), whereas SYS learners did not (p = 0.0680). Stratification of learners in MSK and SYS revealed learners spending between 30 and 60 min in SI sessions during the study period had the highest grades compared to students who spent less than 30 (p = 0.0286) or more than 60 (p = 0.0286) min attending SI sessions, respectively. Most learners in MSK (89.4%) and SYS (66%) concluded that they preferred structured over unstructured SI. Sentiment/thematic analysis using a generative AI-driven large language model revealed learners held positive perceptions of SI, emphasizing structured learning, resources, personalized learning, and support offered as the most prevalent themes surrounding SI. Ultimately, this study provides evidence that supports SI for improving student outcomes related to perceived preparedness for completing assessments and preferred teaching/learning styles in undergraduate human anatomy.Supplemental instruction (SI) confers student success, as represented by grades, knowledge retention, and student engagement.

Abstract: Dental education in India predominantly relies on traditional lecture-based learning (LBL), which may hinder student engagement and learning outcomes. To address these limitations, innovative learning methodologies, such as spaced repetition learning (SRL), are imperative. SRL prioritizes active recall and can enhance long-term knowledge retention. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of SRL delivered through a mobile flashcard application, in enhancing knowledge retention among dental undergraduates. BACKGROUND Dental education in India predominantly relies on traditional lecture-based learning (LBL), which may hinder student engagement and learning outcomes. To address these limitations, innovative learning methodologies, such as spaced repetition learning (SRL), are imperative. SRL prioritizes active recall and can enhance long-term knowledge retention. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of SRL delivered through a mobile flashcard application, in enhancing knowledge retention among dental undergraduates.This single-blind randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2023/10/059347), conducted in Belagavi, India, involved 90 dental students who were equally distributed into control (LBL) and test (lecture followed by SRL demonstration) groups after randomization. Rigorous expert review ensured the quality of PowerPoint presentation and mobile flashcard contents. Knowledge assessments were conducted at baseline, first, and third months using a validated and reliable questionnaire. A perception survey on learning techniques was administered after the first month. Analysis methods included descriptive analysis, Pearson's chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test. METHODS This single-blind randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2023/10/059347), conducted in Belagavi, India, involved 90 dental students who were equally distributed into control (LBL) and test (lecture followed by SRL demonstration) groups after randomization. Rigorous expert review ensured the quality of PowerPoint presentation and mobile flashcard contents. Knowledge assessments were conducted at baseline, first, and third months using a validated and reliable questionnaire. A perception survey on learning techniques was administered after the first month. Analysis methods included descriptive analysis, Pearson's chi-square test, independent t-test, and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test.The pre- and post-intervention knowledge showed no significant differences, but the SRL group exhibited significantly higher retention at both first month (p ≤ 0.001) and third months (p ≤ 0.001) than the LBL group. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant pairwise differences in mean knowledge scores in SRL group. Students had significantly favorable perception toward SRL than LBL group. RESULTS The pre- and post-intervention knowledge showed no significant differences, but the SRL group exhibited significantly higher retention at both first month (p ≤ 0.001) and third months (p ≤ 0.001) than the LBL group. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant pairwise differences in mean knowledge scores in SRL group. Students had significantly favorable perception toward SRL than LBL group.SRL delivered through mobile flashcards significantly enhances knowledge retention compared to LBL among dental students. Positive student perceptions support SRL's integration into dental curricula, with implications for improving knowledge retention among them. CONCLUSION SRL delivered through mobile flashcards significantly enhances knowledge retention compared to LBL among dental students. Positive student perceptions support SRL's integration into dental curricula, with implications for improving knowledge retention among them.

Abstract: Background: In the achievement of optimal learning outcomes, knowledge retention presents a major concern for medical students and educators. Practical dissection courses facilitate the consolidation of knowledge of anatomy. Previously, it was shown that a regional anatomy dissection course is more beneficial over a 3-month than a 1-month duration for gathering pre examination knowledge. This study aimed to assess if follow-up anatomy interventions help consolidate regional anatomy knowledge and facilitate knowledge retention of undergraduate medical students. It was hypothesized that knowledge retention could be enhanced using post-dissection teaching interventions. Methods: Upon completion of the dissection course, Objective Structured Practical Examinations (OSPEs) were performed for the neck, thorax, and abdomen immediately before the start of the oral examinations, with follow-ups at 6 and 12 months. Between each of the examinations, virtual and in-person lectures and seminars on (radiologic) anatomy and pathology were held, including Cinematic Rendering, but without additional teaching on human tissues. Results: Significant improvements were observed for knowledge of the neck and abdomen regions in the 6- and 12-month follow-up OSPEs. The effects of knowledge gain were less marked in ethanol-glycerin- than in Thiel-embalmed tissues. Student perceptions regarding tissue quality correlated positively with their assessment of tissue suitability for examination preparation. In conclusion, even anatomy teaching interventions not utilizing human tissues may help consolidate and improve regional anatomy knowledge over a one-year term. Conclusion: Knowledge retention can be enhanced by accompanying virtual with physical teaching interventions.

Abstract: Introduction: Medical educators strive to improve their curricula to enhance the student learning experience. The use of high-fidelity simulation within basic and clinical medical science subjects has been one of these initiatives. However, there is paucity of evidence on using simulation for teaching pharmacology, especially in the Middle East and North Africa region, and the effectiveness of this teaching modality, relative to more traditional ones, have not been sufficiently investigated. Accordingly, this study compares the effects of high-fidelity simulation, which is designed in alignment with adult and experiential learning theories, and traditional case-based tutorial sessions on the performance and perception of undergraduate Year 2 medical students in pharmacology in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Methods: This study employed a convergent mixed methods approach. Forty-nine medical students were randomly assigned to one of two groups during the 16-week pharmacology course. Each group underwent one session delivered via high-fidelity simulation and another via a case-based tutorial. A short multiple-choice question quiz was administered twice (immediately upon completion of the respective sessions and 5 weeks afterwards) to assess knowledge retention. Furthermore, to explore the students' perceptions regarding the two modes of learning delivery (independently and in relation to each other), an evaluation survey was administered following the delivery of each session. Thereafter, the iterative joint display analysis was used to develop a holistic understanding of the effect of high-fidelity simulation in comparison to traditional case-based tutorial sessions on pharmacology learning in the context of the study. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in students' knowledge retention between high-fidelity simulation and case-based tutorial sessions. Yet, students expressed a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation, describing the corresponding sessions as more varied, better at reinforcing learning, and closer to reality. As such, the meta-inferences led to expansion of the overall understanding around students' satisfaction, to both confirmation and expansion of the systemic viewpoint around students' preferences, and lastly to refinement in relation to the perspective around retained knowledge. Conclusion: High-fidelity simulation was found to be as effective as case-based tutorial sessions in terms of students' retention of knowledge. Nonetheless, students demonstrated a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation. The study advocates caution in adapting high-fidelity simulation, where careful appraisal can lend itself to identifying contexts where it is most effective.

Abstract: Purpose In the construction sector, site excavation is one of the most dangerous and challenging activities. Proper training can be an effective way to mitigate excavation hazards. Virtual reality (VR) has been used as an effective training tool to enhance safety performance in various industries. However, little attention has been paid to the potential of this technology for construction excavation safety training. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes an immersive VR training system for excavation safety and hazard identification. The proposed VR training system was compared with a health and safety manual via a controlled experiment. Findings Results based on scores obtained immediately after training indicate that VR training significantly enhanced practical performance, knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy. Results also show that knowledge was retained four weeks after training. In addition, VR training outperformed health and safety manuals regarding knowledge retention. Originality/value This study measures the practical performance to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VR training system. Also, this study compares the VR training system with a traditional training method by measuring knowledge acquisition and retention. The results demonstrate the potential of VR as a training tool for excavation safety and hazards.

Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to assess lifeguards' knowledge retention of airway management, oxygen administration, and ventilation interventions following certification and employer-provided training. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey administered between February and May 2024. A total of 1322 responses from Canadian lifeguards certified in airway management and oxygen administration were deemed eligible for analysis. The survey included 15 knowledge assessment questions, with data analyzed based on lifeguard experience and the date of last certification or in-service training. Results: The mean knowledge assessment score was 10.4 ± 2.2 (69.3 ± 14.6%), with the highest scores in the airway management category and the lowest in the oxygen administration category. Lifeguard experience significantly increased knowledge retention, whereas recertification showed no significant impact, and employer-provided training significantly decreased knowledge retention. Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of lifeguarding experience in knowledge retention among lifeguards. Optional airway management and oxygen administration recertification, coupled with inconsistent in-service training, have created significant gaps in lifeguard education. This study identifies the need for regular, competency-based training delivered by qualified facilitators. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of lifeguards in emergency response and ensuring high-quality care for drowning victims.Objective: The aim of this study was to assess lifeguards' knowledge retention of airway management, oxygen administration, and ventilation interventions following certification and employer-provided training.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and diseases place a significant burden on the health care system. Despite this, research indicates that physician training in the area of MSK medicine has historically been inadequate, with a majority of medical students feeling that their training in MSK medicine is lacking. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of a new preclinical MSK curriculum that was implemented within a nationally accredited allopathic medical program. BACKGROUND Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and diseases place a significant burden on the health care system. Despite this, research indicates that physician training in the area of MSK medicine has historically been inadequate, with a majority of medical students feeling that their training in MSK medicine is lacking. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the efficacy of a new preclinical MSK curriculum that was implemented within a nationally accredited allopathic medical program.Retrospective analysis was completed on five consecutive years (2017-2021) of preclinical MSK curricular data for 549 medical students, including mid and end-of-course examinations and end-of-course student satisfaction surveys. Both parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis were used to examine within and between class differences (P < 0.05). METHODS Retrospective analysis was completed on five consecutive years (2017-2021) of preclinical MSK curricular data for 549 medical students, including mid and end-of-course examinations and end-of-course student satisfaction surveys. Both parametric and non-parametric methods of analysis were used to examine within and between class differences (P < 0.05).The new MSK curriculum covered 15 of 16 "core or must know" topics in MSK medicine, and academic performance was consistently high over the 5-year period of analysis (final course marks ranged from 76.6 ± 7.1 to 81.4 ± 8.1; failures/year: range from 0 to 4), being equal or above levels of student performance observed for other courses delivered during preclinical studies. Likert data from end-of-course surveys demonstrated that feedback was overwhelmingly positive (overall course satisfaction ranged from a low of 3.07/4.00 to a high of 3.56/4.00) and indicated that students felt that the new preclinical MSK curriculum did effectively support medical student learning and knowledge retention. RESULTS The new MSK curriculum covered 15 of 16 "core or must know" topics in MSK medicine, and academic performance was consistently high over the 5-year period of analysis (final course marks ranged from 76.6 ± 7.1 to 81.4 ± 8.1; failures/year: range from 0 to 4), being equal or above levels of student performance observed for other courses delivered during preclinical studies.

Abstract: Metro construction poses significant risks and is prone to severe safety accidents. Safety training is critical to mitigate risks and reduce the number of accidents, as it allows workers to enhance their skills in risk identification, risk assessment, and risk response and ultimately reduce accidents. However, traditional training methods used today, such as slide presentations, videos, or text-based materials, provide a passive learning environment, which can limit their effectiveness in knowledge transfer. Augmented Reality (AR) has emerged as a promising tool for training, allowing trainees to have an active learning environment. Nevertheless, research on assessing the effectiveness of AR safety training while comparing it with traditional methods is still limited. This study aims to compare the short-term and long-term effects on objective performance measures and subjective evaluations of both traditional and AR training. This is done by developing a new AR safety training for metro construction and comparing it with an equivalent slide-based safety training with 72 participants divided into two training groups. The selected safety case study covers the entire safety risk management process, including risk identification, risk assessment, and risk response. Results indicate that AR training is more effective than traditional training in terms of short-term knowledge acquisition of risk identification and long-term knowledge retention of risk identification, risk assessment, and risk response. These findings can have implications for the design of future safety training guidelines and recommendations.

Abstract: Retrieval-based learning, using tests for content review, frequently proves more effective for knowledge retention compared to alternative methods. Extensive research has explored this with older students, often in contrast to more passive techniques like rereading or note rewriting, typically focusing on vocabulary content, in non-classroom settings and assessing knowledge retention within a week. In this study we conducted a classroom experiment to compare the efficacy of retrieval-based learning to another active method of reviewing content, namely discussion, in promoting long-term knowledge retention among primary school science students. Additionally, we assessed the students’ perceptions of these reviewing methods. A total of eighty-one primary school students participated in the study, which encompassed a lesson conducted at a zoo, followed by a review of the lesson content using either retrieval-based learning or discussion. Our findings indicated no impact of the method of reviewing on knowledge retention after either one week or four weeks. Nevertheless, notable effects were observed in terms of motivation, as students who employed retrieval-based learning for reviewing reported heightened levels of interest and enjoyment, along with perceiving greater benefits from the process. Additionally, boys in the discussion group reported increased curiosity, in contrast to girls who reported an inverse pattern.

Abstract: The primary aim of this study conducted in 2023 was to enhance the understanding of software design patterns at a private university in Trujillo. Utilizing an applied, purely experimental design, the research involved 60 fourth-semester students from the systems engineering program, divided equally into a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG). The latter group engaged with a serious video game as part of the learning process. Data collection was facilitated through questionnaires and observation, and analyzed using Jamovi software version 2.4.11. Findings indicated notable improvements: a 5-point increase (25%) in knowledge retention (LKR), a 1-point rise (5%) in understanding (LU), a 0.46-point growth (9.2%) in motivation (LM), and a 0.50-point boost (10%) in satisfaction (LS). The study concluded that integrating a serious video game significantly bolstered the learning of software design patterns at the institution.

Abstract: Objectives: Critical CHD is associated with morbidity and mortality, worsened by delayed diagnosis. Paediatric residents are front-line clinicians, yet identification of congenital CHD remains challenging. Current exposure to cardiology is limited in paediatric resident education. We evaluated the impact of rapid cycle deliberate practice simulation on paediatric residents’ skills, knowledge, and perceived competence to recognise and manage infants with congenital CHD. Methods: We conducted a 6-month pilot study. Interns rotating in paediatric cardiology completed a case scenario assessment during weeks 1 and 4 and participated in paired simulations (traditional debrief and rapid cycle deliberate practice) in weeks 2–4. We assessed interns’ skills during the simulation using a checklist of “cannot miss” tasks. In week 4, they completed a retrospective pre-post knowledge-based survey. We analysed the data using summary statistics and mixed effect linear regression. Results: A total of 26 interns participated. There was a significant increase in case scenario assessment scores between weeks 1 and 4 (4, interquartile range 3–6 versus 8, interquartile range 6–10; p-value < 0.0001). The percentage of “cannot miss” tasks on the simulation checklist increased from weeks 2 to 3 (73% versus 83%, p-value 0.0263) and from weeks 2–4 (73% versus 92%, p-value 0.0025). The retrospective pre-post survey scores also increased (1.67, interquartile range 1.33–2.17 versus 3.83, interquartile range 3.17–4; p-value < 0.0001). Conclusion: Rapid cycle deliberate practice simulations resulted in improved recognition and initiation of treatment of simulated infants with congenital CHD among paediatric interns. Future studies will include full implementation of the curriculum and knowledge retention work.

Abstract: Background Gamification, the incorporation of game theory into the curriculum, has been correlated with improved knowledge retention compared to standard didactics. Objective To determine the impact of gamified hepatology modules on medical student knowledge retention and exam performance. Methods We created three web-based, gamified hepatology modules with 15-question pre- and post-tests. Differences in each module's pre- and post-test scores were compared using paired t-tests. Medical school exam scores (total score and hepatology-specific score) in module users versus non-users were compared using independent two-sample t-tests. Results Module completion yielded significant increases in pre- to post-test scores for the jaundice (p=0.002) and anatomy modules (p<0.001). Module users scored 1.2 points higher on the total exam score (p=0.4) and 2 points higher on the hepatology exam score (p=0.31). Post-module survey results revealed higher knowledge retention in hepatology topics, expanded interest in hepatology, and an increased inclination to use web-based learning platforms for future learning experiences. Conclusion Module use led to improved post-test scores in the modules. Module users also had higher hepatology exam and total exam scores, yet, this difference was not statistically significant. Overall, this study suggests that gamification may be beneficial in aiding hepatology knowledge recall.Background Gamification, the incorporation of game theory into the curriculum, has been correlated with improved knowledge retention compared to standard didactics.

Abstract: Metaphor generation is both a creative act and a means of learning. When learning a new concept, people often create a metaphor to connect the new concept to existing knowledge. Does the manner in which people generate a metaphor, via sudden insight (Aha! moment) or deliberate analysis, influence the quality of generation and subsequent learning outcomes? According to some research, deliberate processing enhances knowledge retention; hence, generation via analysis likely leads to better concept learning. However, other research has shown that solutions generated via insight are better remembered. In the current study, participants were presented with science concepts and descriptions, then generated metaphors for the concepts. They also indicated how they generated each metaphor and rated their metaphor for novelty and aptness. We assessed participants’ learning outcomes with a memory test and evaluated the creative quality of the metaphors based on self‐ and crowd‐sourced ratings. Consistent with the deliberate processing benefit, participants became more familiar with the target science concept if they previously generated a metaphor for the concept via analysis compared to via insight. We also found that metaphors generated via analysis did not differ from metaphors generated via insight in quality (aptness or novelty) nor in how well they were remembered. However, participants’ self‐evaluations of metaphors generated via insight showed more agreement with independent raters, suggesting the role of insight in modulating the creative ideation process. These preliminary findings have implications for understanding the nature of insight during idea generation and its impact on learning.

Abstract: Retrieval-based learning, using tests for content review, frequently proves more effective for knowledge retention compared to alternative methods. Extensive research has explored this with older students, often in contrast to more passive techniques like rereading or note rewriting, typically focusing on vocabulary content, in non-classroom settings and assessing knowledge retention within a week. In this study we conducted a classroom experiment to compare the efficacy of retrieval-based learning to another active method of reviewing content, namely discussion, in promoting long-term knowledge retention among primary school science students. Additionally, we assessed the students’ perceptions of these reviewing methods. A total of eighty-one primary school students participated in the study, which encompassed a lesson conducted at a zoo, followed by a review of the lesson content using either retrieval-based learning or discussion. Our findings indicated no impact of the method of reviewing on knowledge retention after either one week or four weeks. Nevertheless, notable effects were observed in terms of motivation, as students who employed retrieval-based learning for reviewing reported heightened levels of interest and enjoyment, along with perceiving greater benefits from the process. Additionally, boys in the discussion group reported increased curiosity, in contrast to girls who reported an inverse pattern.

Abstract: Metaphor generation is both a creative act and a means of learning. When learning a new concept, people often create a metaphor to connect the new concept to existing knowledge. Does the manner in which people generate a metaphor, via sudden insight (Aha! moment) or deliberate analysis, influence the quality of generation and subsequent learning outcomes? According to some research, deliberate processing enhances knowledge retention; hence, generation via analysis likely leads to better concept learning. However, other research has shown that solutions generated via insight are better remembered. In the current study, participants were presented with science concepts and descriptions, then generated metaphors for the concepts. They also indicated how they generated each metaphor and rated their metaphor for novelty and aptness. We assessed participants' learning outcomes with a memory test and evaluated the creative quality of the metaphors based on self- and crowd-sourced ratings. Consistent with the deliberate processing benefit, participants became more familiar with the target science concept if they previously generated a metaphor for the concept via analysis compared to via insight. We also found that metaphors generated via analysis did not differ from metaphors generated via insight in quality (aptness or novelty) nor in how well they were remembered. However, participants' self-evaluations of metaphors generated via insight showed more agreement with independent raters, suggesting the role of insight in modulating the creative ideation process. These preliminary findings have implications for understanding the nature of insight during idea generation and its impact on learning.Metaphor generation is both a creative act and a means of learning.

Abstract: Evolving trends in medical education and modern curricular changes have reduced the amount of time and resources allocated for anatomy education. As the amount of dedicated anatomy education time decreases, more self-directed learning is required. Cadaveric dissection and didactic teaching have been supplemented with multimedia, clinical anatomy, and imaging for over 20 years, with mixed results. Specifically, the use of video-based anatomy teaching increases medical learning, if done methodically. INTRODUCTION Evolving trends in medical education and modern curricular changes have reduced the amount of time and resources allocated for anatomy education. As the amount of dedicated anatomy education time decreases, more self-directed learning is required. Cadaveric dissection and didactic teaching have been supplemented with multimedia, clinical anatomy, and imaging for over 20 years, with mixed results. Specifically, the use of video-based anatomy teaching increases medical learning, if done methodically.A 20-minute video was produced highlighting surgical anatomy using the following operative cases: perineal anatomy (artificial urinary sphincter case), inguinal and testicular anatomy (scrotal orchidopexy for acute testicular torsion), prostate anatomy (robotic radical prostatectomy), and bladder anatomy (endoscopy). The annotated video was shown to first-year medical students. Pre- and post-video multiple choice question quizzes were given to the students. Once submitted, the students completed a survey. METHODS A 20-minute video was produced highlighting surgical anatomy using the following operative cases: perineal anatomy (artificial urinary sphincter case), inguinal and testicular anatomy (scrotal orchidopexy for acute testicular torsion), prostate anatomy (robotic radical prostatectomy), and bladder anatomy (endoscopy). The annotated video was shown to first-year medical students. Pre- and post-video multiple choice question quizzes were given to the students. Once submitted, the students completed a survey.Overall, 191 first-year medical students participated in our study. Average scores were similar between each quiz (50±16% vs. 49±17%) and there was no statistically significant change. Seventy-seven percent of participants felt the video improved their knowledge of urologic anatomy and 83% agreed the video should be shown to future classes. Sixty percent of participants felt the video solidified their anatomy knowledge, 78% felt the video was stimulating and entertaining, and 43% of the students felt the video increased their interest in pursuing urology as a career choice.

Abstract: Introduction Medical educators strive to improve their curricula to enhance the student learning experience. The use of high-fidelity simulation within basic and clinical medical science subjects has been one of these initiatives. However, there is paucity of evidence on using simulation for teaching pharmacology, especially in the Middle East and North Africa region, and the effectiveness of this teaching modality, relative to more traditional ones, have not been sufficiently investigated. Accordingly, this study compares the effects of high-fidelity simulation, which is designed in alignment with adult and experiential learning theories, and traditional case-based tutorial sessions on the performance and perception of undergraduate Year 2 medical students in pharmacology in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Methods This study employed a convergent mixed methods approach. Forty-nine medical students were randomly assigned to one of two groups during the 16-week pharmacology course. Each group underwent one session delivered via high-fidelity simulation and another via a case-based tutorial. A short multiple-choice question quiz was administered twice (immediately upon completion of the respective sessions and 5 weeks afterwards) to assess knowledge retention. Furthermore, to explore the students’ perceptions regarding the two modes of learning delivery (independently and in relation to each other), an evaluation survey was administered following the delivery of each session. Thereafter, the iterative joint display analysis was used to develop a holistic understanding of the effect of high-fidelity simulation in comparison to traditional case-based tutorial sessions on pharmacology learning in the context of the study. Results There was no statistically significant difference in students’ knowledge retention between high-fidelity simulation and case-based tutorial sessions. Yet, students expressed a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation, describing the corresponding sessions as more varied, better at reinforcing learning, and closer to reality. As such, the meta-inferences led to expansion of the overall understanding around students’ satisfaction, to both confirmation and expansion of the systemic viewpoint around students’ preferences, and lastly to refinement in relation to the perspective around retained knowledge. Conclusion High-fidelity simulation was found to be as effective as case-based tutorial sessions in terms of students’ retention of knowledge. Nonetheless, students demonstrated a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation. The study advocates caution in adapting high-fidelity simulation, where careful appraisal can lend itself to identifying contexts where it is most effective.

Abstract: Oral cancer is significantly high in India, and screening is an effective approach to downstage the disease. Educating Community Health Workers (CHWs) on early oral cancer detection is an effective step toward reducing the burden and serves as a first step toward facilitating the transfer of knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this hands-on education was to equip CHWs with insight on the advanced diagnostics, preventive techniques, and innovations for the early detection of oral cancer. Objectives Oral cancer is significantly high in India, and screening is an effective approach to downstage the disease. Educating Community Health Workers (CHWs) on early oral cancer detection is an effective step toward reducing the burden and serves as a first step toward facilitating the transfer of knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this hands-on education was to equip CHWs with insight on the advanced diagnostics, preventive techniques, and innovations for the early detection of oral cancer.A total of 178 participants were trained in two groups: Group 1 received training for screening and primary prevention, while group 2 received training on updates in recent diagnostic adjuncts and innovations, AI-enabled point-of-care diagnostics, and essential patient care in management of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs). Pre- and post-assessment questionnaires were used to evaluate the participants. Materials and Methods A total of 178 participants were trained in two groups: Group 1 received training for screening and primary prevention, while group 2 received training on updates in recent diagnostic adjuncts and innovations, AI-enabled point-of-care diagnostics, and essential patient care in management of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs). Pre- and post-assessment questionnaires were used to evaluate the participants.The knowledge assessment scores between the pre- and post-tests showed a statistically significant difference ( p  < 0.001), with rise in mean score of 3.99 from baseline. Six months following training, knowledge retention revealed a statistically significant difference ( p  < 0.001) in the participants' ability to recall the information.

Abstract: Objectives Oral cancer is significantly high in India, and screening is an effective approach to downstage the disease. Educating Community Health Workers (CHWs) on early oral cancer detection is an effective step toward reducing the burden and serves as a first step toward facilitating the transfer of knowledge. Therefore, the purpose of this hands-on education was to equip CHWs with insight on the advanced diagnostics, preventive techniques, and innovations for the early detection of oral cancer. Materials and Methods A total of 178 participants were trained in two groups: Group 1 received training for screening and primary prevention, while group 2 received training on updates in recent diagnostic adjuncts and innovations, AI-enabled point-of-care diagnostics, and essential patient care in management of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs). Pre- and post-assessment questionnaires were used to evaluate the participants. Results The knowledge assessment scores between the pre- and post-tests showed a statistically significant difference ( p  < 0.001), with rise in mean score of 3.99 from baseline. Six months following training, knowledge retention revealed a statistically significant difference ( p  < 0.001) in the participants' ability to recall the information. Conclusion A well-structured training module can create awareness, impart knowledge and upskill the CHWs for early detection of oral cancer. Retraining of CHWs is required for knowledge retention post-training.

Abstract: According to research in cognitive behavioral sci-ences and education, learners must regularly review previously learned information to reduce potential knowledge loss between the didactic and clinical portions of the anesthesia curriculum. Both methods of evaluation are crucial to determining the relevance, clarity, and im-portance of the content included in the tooi, which adds to the rigor of the assessment modality High content validity means that the tooi assesses exactly what it was created to assess. [...]utilizing a validated tooi addressing the anesthetic management of patients with LVADs allows for more rigorous periodic assessment of CRNAs' knowledge in accordance with departmental policies regarding provider competency. Prior to implementation of the content validity assessment (CVA), each of the 16 final items were reviewed by the research team which con-sisted of a registered nurse with cardiothoracic intensive care unit experience (SS), a cardiothoracic CRNA with test-item writing experience (MC), and a PhD-prepared nurse scientist with LVAD experience (LS). * Phase Three: Expert Panel Review and CVA Completion. A copy of the CVA contained a stem for each item, and response options from the LAmA tooi. Because there were 16 items, the content validity tooi had 16

Abstract: Safely anesthetizing patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can be intimidating, particularly for novice anesthesia providers. Given the variety of complex issues anesthesia providers may encounter with patients, it would be impractical to expect expertise in every population. To combat the inevitable loss of knowledge, education experts recommend active learning techniques, including test-enhanced learning, active recall, and spaced repetition. To that end, this research team created an LVAD Assessment for Anesthesia, or LAmA tool, to be evaluated for content validity by eight experts. The LAmA tool and content validity assessment were distributed to two anesthesiologists and four nurse anesthetists in the cardiothoracic anesthesia department at a hospital in Northeast Ohio, as well as to two outside nursing research experts. Results were analyzed by the research team and the content validity index (CVI) was determined. A CVI of at least 0.875 was required for the tool to be valid, and final scores in the categories of relevance, clarity, and importance were all ≥ 0.9. The data from the validated tool were used to create a pocket reference on LVAD anesthetic management. Both educational assessments and pocket references have the potential to positively impact knowledge retention and patient outcomes, making them excellent clinical resources.Safely anesthetizing patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can be intimidating, particularly for novice anesthesia providers.

Abstract: Background Instructional videos constitute a pivotal component in flipped learning. Despite their significance, there is a dearth of research specifically dedicated to instructional videos within the context of flipped classrooms. This paucity has led to an empirical void in verifying the efficacy of instructional videos in flipped learning environments. Objectives The present study endeavours to contribute to the extant literature on flipped pedagogical practices by providing empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of instructional videos in flipped learning environments. Methods This study employs a convergent mixed‐methods design. Forty‐five instructional videos in three subtypes were administered in two classes over a 15‐week semester. Data, both quantitative (log data from the learning management system) and qualitative (from focus group discussions at two time points), were concurrently collected from a flipped class ( n  = 25) and a blended class ( n  = 28) with the aim of gauging student engagement and learning outcomes in the flipped class and understanding video‐viewing features typical of the flipped class. Results Both datasets corroborated that participants in the flipped class outperformed their counterparts in the blended class in terms of video‐watching, peer interaction, knowledge retention, and transfer skills. Conclusions The instructional videos within the flipped classroom setting serve to enhance student engagement in the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The efficacy of these instructional videos in flipped learning can be further augmented through strategic approaches in both their design and implementation. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is currently known about this topic The flipping pedagogy is conducive to learning. Videos play a crucial role in flipped learning. Videos prepared students for classroom activities. However, engaging students with pre‐class videos presents a challenge. What this paper adds This paper furnishes direct empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of instructional videos in flipped learning. It uncovers factors affecting student engagement with videos in flipped learning. It offers insights into the design and implementation of videos in flipped learning. Implications for practice Considering facilitating conditions and affective factors when creating videos. Acknowledging learner characteristics when designing videos. Utilizing instructional strategies when implementing videos.

Abstract: Critical CHD is associated with morbidity and mortality, worsened by delayed diagnosis. Paediatric residents are front-line clinicians, yet identification of congenital CHD remains challenging. Current exposure to cardiology is limited in paediatric resident education. We evaluated the impact of rapid cycle deliberate practice simulation on paediatric residents' skills, knowledge, and perceived competence to recognise and manage infants with congenital CHD. OBJECTIVES Critical CHD is associated with morbidity and mortality, worsened by delayed diagnosis. Paediatric residents are front-line clinicians, yet identification of congenital CHD remains challenging. Current exposure to cardiology is limited in paediatric resident education. We evaluated the impact of rapid cycle deliberate practice simulation on paediatric residents' skills, knowledge, and perceived competence to recognise and manage infants with congenital CHD.We conducted a 6-month pilot study. Interns rotating in paediatric cardiology completed a case scenario assessment during weeks 1 and 4 and participated in paired simulations (traditional debrief and rapid cycle deliberate practice) in weeks 2-4. We assessed interns' skills during the simulation using a checklist of "cannot miss" tasks. In week 4, they completed a retrospective pre-post knowledge-based survey. We analysed the data using summary statistics and mixed effect linear regression. METHODS We conducted a 6-month pilot study. Interns rotating in paediatric cardiology completed a case scenario assessment during weeks 1 and 4 and participated in paired simulations (traditional debrief and rapid cycle deliberate practice) in weeks 2-4. We assessed interns' skills during the simulation using a checklist of "cannot miss" tasks. In week 4, they completed a retrospective pre-post knowledge-based survey. We analysed the data using summary statistics and mixed effect linear regression.A total of 26 interns participated. There was a significant increase in case scenario assessment scores between weeks 1 and 4 (4, interquartile range 3-6 versus 8, interquartile range 6-10; p-value < 0.0001). The percentage of "cannot miss" tasks on the simulation checklist increased from weeks 2 to 3 (73% versus 83%, p-value 0.0263) and from weeks 2-4 (73% versus 92%, p-value 0.0025). The retrospective pre-post survey scores also increased (1.67, interquartile range 1.33-2.17 versus 3.83, interquartile range 3.17-4; p-value < 0.0001). RESULTS A total of 26 interns participated. There was a significant increase in case scenario assessment scores between weeks 1 and 4 (4, interquartile range 3-6 versus 8, interquartile range 6-10; p-value < 0.0001).

Abstract: Background: Instructional videos constitute a pivotal component in flipped learning. Despite their significance, there is a dearth of research specifically dedicated to instructional videos within the context of flipped classrooms. This paucity has led to an empirical void in verifying the efficacy of instructional videos in flipped learning environments. Objectives: The present study endeavours to contribute to the extant literature on flipped pedagogical practices by providing empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of instructional videos in flipped learning environments. Methods: This study employs a convergent mixed‐methods design. Forty‐five instructional videos in three subtypes were administered in two classes over a 15‐week semester. Data, both quantitative (log data from the learning management system) and qualitative (from focus group discussions at two time points), were concurrently collected from a flipped class ( n = 25) and a blended class ( n = 28) with the aim of gauging student engagement and learning outcomes in the flipped class and understanding video‐viewing features typical of the flipped class. Results: Both datasets corroborated that participants in the flipped class outperformed their counterparts in the blended class in terms of video‐watching, peer interaction, knowledge retention, and transfer skills. Conclusions: The instructional videos within the flipped classroom setting serve to enhance student engagement in the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The efficacy of these instructional videos in flipped learning can be further augmented through strategic approaches in both their design and implementation.

Abstract: Accessible Summary What is known on the subject? Storytelling is an effective tool for communication, is universally comprehensible and transcends linguistic barriers, adapting to cultures easily. Storytelling has a strong influence on children and has been used for knowledge retention and for developing imagination, creativity and prosocial behaviours. What this paper adds to existing knowledge? The systematic review offers essential insights into the effects of storytelling interventions on the development of resilience in children. It indicates the various forms of storytelling interventions implemented and also the specific measures of resilience employed in the studies. The review has demonstrated that storytelling plays a crucial role in the development of protective factors in children including resilience. What are the implications for practice? Psychiatric and mental health nurses working in community, hospital or mental health units play an important role in mental health interventions, particularly when it comes to children and young adults. Employing storytelling techniques can help psychiatric and mental health nurses provide timely and consistent support to children while helping them explore support systems, mechanisms and coping strategies helping build resilience. This holds particular importance for low‐ and middle‐income countries where limited resources pose challenges in providing adequate support for mental health programmes for children. Methods such as storytelling are simple and adaptable to the specific challenges faced in the mental health setting. Abstract Introduction Resilience is a crucial aspect of mental health and coping that enables individuals to effectively recover from challenges. Fostering resilience in children becomes a significant objective. Storytelling is known to positively affect resilience, providing opportunities to share and develop narratives that help make sense of difficult experiences, find meaning in them, and building beliefs around our capacity to adapt well to challenging experiences. Aim The aim of this review is to synthesize peer‐reviewed studies on the impact of storytelling interventions in developing resilience in children. Method The review adhered to the updated PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022365474). We conducted searches in 12 databases with search strings comprising of concepts regarding storytelling, resilience and children. Results The review included 11 studies published between 2012 and 2022. The narrative synthesis of the studies indicates that storytelling interventions enhanced psychological resilience in children. Discussion Storytelling‐based interventions in school settings with participatory approaches using cultural stories, and positive psychology‐based interventions were effective and feasible. Implications for Practice This review has scope for informing future interventions with children, especially those who live in marginalized communities in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs).

Abstract: Digital games for education and training, also called serious games (SGs), have shown beneficial effects on learning in several studies. In addition, some studies are suggesting that SGs could improve user's perceived control, which affects the likelihood that the learned content will be applied in the real world. However, most SG studies tend to focus on immediate effects, providing no indication on knowledge and perceived control over time, especially in contrast with nongame approaches. Moreover, SG research on perceived control has focused mainly on self-efficacy, disregarding the complementary construct of locus of control (LOC). This article advances both lines of research, assessing user's knowledge and LOC over time, with a SG as well as traditional printed materials that teach the same content. Results show that the SG was more effective than printed materials for knowledge retention over time, and a better retention outcome was found also for LOC. An additional contribution of the paper is the proposal of a novel SG that targets the inclusivity goal of safe evacuation for all, extending SG research to a domain not dealt with before, i.e., assisting persons with disabilities in emergencies.Digital games for education and training, also called serious games (SGs), have shown beneficial effects on learning in several studies.

Abstract: PurposeThe proliferation of online learning and digital media has both expanded opportunities for violence prevention programming and presented challenges for replicating the benefits of in-person learning environments. The advent of learning management systems (LMS) and online data collection tools has advanced scientific inquiry and reach, while also requiring mastery of an ever-changing digital landscape.MethodsThis paper provides a framework for developing effective online violence prevention trainings, using tenets of bystander intervention, andragogical learning principles, learning taxonomies, and eLearning instructional design.ResultsOur application of online violence prevention training was selected because evidence-based in-person bystander training models exist and can serve as a content model for online adaptation. Specifically, we review how to design interventions that appeal to adult learners’ needs and motivations (andragogical learning principles), organize learning outcomes according to a range of cognitive processes (learning taxonomies), and create engaging digital learning products (eLearning instructional design). Further, we discuss how to promote knowledge retention and skills acquisition through cognitive and behavioral interactivity, role play demonstrations, real-time assessment, and simulation-based learning. We describe practical components of online training development, including technological considerations, creative elements, and evaluative measures. Lastly, we provide direction on vendor selection; ensuring web content accessibility compliance; and optimizing data capture.ConclusionsBy exploring new directions in online interventions for violence research, we seek to bridge existing gaps in training delivered in-person and in digital settings.

Abstract: Basic sciences are crucial for clinical medicine, yet studies focusing on their perceived utility among general practitioners (GPs) are sparse. Considering the broad scope of GPs' practice, an in-depth understanding of basic sciences is fundamental for making informed clinical decisions. This study evaluated GP registrars' retention and perceptions of the utility of basic sciences in clinical practice. BACKGROUND Basic sciences are crucial for clinical medicine, yet studies focusing on their perceived utility among general practitioners (GPs) are sparse. Considering the broad scope of GPs' practice, an in-depth understanding of basic sciences is fundamental for making informed clinical decisions. This study evaluated GP registrars' retention and perceptions of the utility of basic sciences in clinical practice.Using sequential explanatory mixed methods study design, knowledge retention was assessed by a multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination followed by interviews on the perception of the relevance and utility of basic sciences among GP registrars at James Cook University's (JCU) General Practice Training (GPT) program. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted on the MCQ exam data, while thematic analysis was employed for the qualitative interview data. METHODS Using sequential explanatory mixed methods study design, knowledge retention was assessed by a multiple-choice question (MCQ) examination followed by interviews on the perception of the relevance and utility of basic sciences among GP registrars at James Cook University's (JCU) General Practice Training (GPT) program. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted on the MCQ exam data, while thematic analysis was employed for the qualitative interview data.Sixty-one GP registrars participated in the MCQ exam, while 11 of them were involved in the interviews. The highest mean score was obtained in biochemistry (75.1 ± 2.23) while the lowest mean score was in anatomy (56.07 ± 3.16). Key performance predictors included the formative clinical examination scores (β = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.2, p < 0.001) and gender (β = -9.7, 95% CI: -17 to -2.3, p = 0.011). The qualitative data analysis revealed five themes, including the backbone of clinical medicine, varying utility over time and by specialty, clinical synthesis integrates encapsulated knowledge, professional pressures hinder revisitation of knowledge and knowledge renewal enhances updates.

Abstract: We constructed a hypothetical model of the knowledge of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and self-perception of support of staff working in after-school day services to clarify structural relationships. BACKGROUND We constructed a hypothetical model of the knowledge of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and self-perception of support of staff working in after-school day services to clarify structural relationships.A questionnaire survey was conducted at 194 facilities providing after-school day services in Fukushima Prefecture (October 2020), including a basic attributes questionnaire, the Literacy Scale of Characteristics of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (LS-ASD), and a staff questionnaire. We developed a hypothetical model of the relationship between self-perception and LS-ASD total scores of after-school service staff. To obtain latent variables for structural equation modeling (SEM) to confirm factor extraction and the interrelationships among variables, exploratory factor analysis was performed. SEM was used to examine the fit of the hypothetical model to the data and the relationships among variables. METHODS A questionnaire survey was conducted at 194 facilities providing after-school day services in Fukushima Prefecture (October 2020), including a basic attributes questionnaire, the Literacy Scale of Characteristics of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (LS-ASD), and a staff questionnaire. We developed a hypothetical model of the relationship between self-perception and LS-ASD total scores of after-school service staff. To obtain latent variables for structural equation modeling (SEM) to confirm factor extraction and the interrelationships among variables, exploratory factor analysis was performed. SEM was used to examine the fit of the hypothetical model to the data and the relationships among variables.The study included 302 staff members from 58 of 194 facilities. Four factors (Factor 1, motivation; 2, self-perception of knowledge; 3, information sharing; 4, self-confidence) were extracted. The final model showed that Factor 2 had a positive direct effect (path coefficient = 0.64) and Factor 4 had a negative direct effect (path coefficient = -0.22) on LS-ASD scores. The model goodness of fit was acceptable (Goodness-of-Fit Index = 0.890; Comparative Fit Index = 0.912; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.086; Akaike's Information Criterion = 392.7). RESULTS The study included 302 staff members from 58 of 194 facilities. Four factors (Factor 1, motivation; 2, self-perception of knowledge; 3, information sharing; 4, self-confidence) were extracted. The final model showed that Factor 2 had a positive direct effect (path coefficient = 0.64) and Factor 4 had a negative direct effect (path coefficient = -0.22) on LS-ASD scores. The model goodness of fit was acceptable (Goodness-of-Fit Index = 0.890; Comparative Fit Index = 0.912; Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.086; Akaike's Information Criterion = 392.7).Self-perception of knowledge contributes greatly to knowledge acquisition, while excessive confidence may hinder knowledge retention.

Abstract: Effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for nursing students is crucial for improving patient outcomes in cardiac arrest scenarios. This study assesses the impact of infographic versus video feedback on enhancing nursing students' clinical skills in Basic Life Support (BLS). BACKGROUND Effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training for nursing students is crucial for improving patient outcomes in cardiac arrest scenarios. This study assesses the impact of infographic versus video feedback on enhancing nursing students' clinical skills in Basic Life Support (BLS).In a randomized controlled setting, 76 nursing students at Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences were divided into two groups: one received infographic-based education and the other video feedback training. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured knowledge and skill retention using validated questionnaires. METHODS In a randomized controlled setting, 76 nursing students at Torbat Heydariyeh University of Medical Sciences were divided into two groups: one received infographic-based education and the other video feedback training. Pre- and post-intervention assessments measured knowledge and skill retention using validated questionnaires.Post-training, the infographic group showed significantly higher knowledge scores, while the video feedback group exhibited greater improvement in CPR skill performance. No significant differences were noted in pre-training assessment scores between the groups. RESULTS Post-training, the infographic group showed significantly higher knowledge scores, while the video feedback group exhibited greater improvement in CPR skill performance. No significant differences were noted in pre-training assessment scores between the groups.Infographic-based education enhances BLS knowledge retention, and video feedback improves practical CPR skills. This suggests potential benefits of a combined infographic and video feedback approach for optimizing CPR training outcomes, addressing a critical need in medical education. CONCLUSION Infographic-based education enhances BLS knowledge retention, and video feedback improves practical CPR skills. This suggests potential benefits of a combined infographic and video feedback approach for optimizing CPR training outcomes, addressing a critical need in medical education.

Abstract: Correct child car restraint use significantly reduces risk of death and serious injury in motor vehicle crashes, but millions of US children ride with improper restraints. We created a tablet-based car restraint educational intervention using Computer Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) and examined its impact on knowledge and behaviours among parents in the paediatric emergency department (PED). BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Correct child car restraint use significantly reduces risk of death and serious injury in motor vehicle crashes, but millions of US children ride with improper restraints. We created a tablet-based car restraint educational intervention using Computer Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) and examined its impact on knowledge and behaviours among parents in the paediatric emergency department (PED).This was a non-blinded, randomised controlled trial of parents of PED patients ages 0-12 years. Participants were evaluated for baseline car restraint knowledge and behaviour. The intervention group completed an interactive tablet-based module, while the control group received printed handouts on car restraint safety. After 1 week, both groups received a follow-up survey assessing changes in car restraint knowledge and behaviour. Logistic regressions determined predictors of knowledge retention and behavioural changes. Parents in the CIAS group were also surveyed on programme acceptability. METHODS This was a non-blinded, randomised controlled trial of parents of PED patients ages 0-12 years. Participants were evaluated for baseline car restraint knowledge and behaviour. The intervention group completed an interactive tablet-based module, while the control group received printed handouts on car restraint safety. After 1 week, both groups received a follow-up survey assessing changes in car restraint knowledge and behaviour. Logistic regressions determined predictors of knowledge retention and behavioural changes. Parents in the CIAS group were also surveyed on programme acceptability.211 parents completed the study with follow-up data. There was no significant difference in baseline car restraint knowledge (74.3% correct in intervention, 61.8% in control, p=0.15), or increase in follow-up restraint knowledge. Significantly more intervention-group caregivers reported modifying their child's car restraint at follow-up (52.5% vs 31.8%,p=0.003), and 93.7% of them found CIAS helpful in learning to improve car safety. RESULTS 211 parents completed the study with follow-up data. There was no significant difference in baseline car restraint knowledge (74.3% correct in intervention, 61.8% in control, p=0.15), or increase in follow-up restraint knowledge. Significantly more intervention-group caregivers reported modifying their child's car restraint at follow-up (52.5% vs 31.8%,p=0.003), and 93.7% of them found CIAS helpful in learning to improve car safety.Parents had overall high levels of car restraint knowledge. Using CIAS led to positive behavioural changes regarding child car restraint safety, with the vast majority reporting positive attitudes towards CIAS. This novel, interactive, tablet-based tool is a useful PED intervention for behavioural change in parents. CONCLUSION Parents had overall high levels of car restraint knowledge. Using CIAS led to positive behavioural changes regarding child car restraint safety, with the vast majority reporting positive attitudes towards CIAS. This novel, interactive, tablet-based tool is a useful PED intervention for behavioural change in parents.NCT03799393. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT03799393.

Abstract: Background: Sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and human trafficking are traumatic events for individuals and communities. As healthcare shortages increase, critical access hospitals must manage resources to ensure comprehensive forensic care effectively. Current literature indicates a lack of forensic healthcare education for providers within critical access hospitals. This forensic education module for critical access healthcare providers aimed to (a) increase forensic examination competencies, (b) improve forensic interviewing skills, (c) increase provider self-efficacy, and (d) show knowledge retention. Methods: This mixed-methods pilot study utilized a convenience sample of 45 healthcare providers in Nebraska critical access hospitals who presented for the forensic education module training. Repeated measures analysis of variance and paired t tests assessed the aims of this study. Structured surveys gathered qualitative data on three themes. Results: Implementation of the forensic education module showed a statistically significant increase in forensic interviewing skills, nonstatistically significant changes in general self-efficacy, and sustainability of knowledge and self-efficacy over 6 weeks. Analysis also showed a clinically significant increase in provider self-efficacy over 6 weeks. Structured questionnaire responses showed participants valued the content to address their perceived barriers to providing care. Conclusions: This study validates the need for increased education in Nebraska's rural and medically underserved areas to ensure access to forensic care and provision of services. This pilot study shows the potential for forensic education interventions to increase provider competencies and improve provider self-efficacy, with evidence of retention of knowledge and skills.

Abstract: This paper extends the fast-growing research stream on gamification in corporate training by examining the impact of gamification on employees' knowledge retention, knowledge sharing, and job performance. A mixed-methods approach was employed. Quantitative data from surveys and qualitative insights from experimental research were combined to ascertain the effectiveness of gamification techniques in corporate training. The sample consisted of 110 employees and business owners who attended gamified training sessions powered by the Discovery-Innovation-Growth platform. Participants were aged 18 to 64 years and had diverse educational backgrounds and job positions. They were also based in different European countries (Spain, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, and Romania). The sample characteristics thus ensured comprehensive coverage of different employee profiles. Gamification significantly enhanced knowledge retention and job performance. Gamification techniques such as points, badges, and leaderboards positively influenced employee engagement, which in turn boosted the ability to retain and apply knowledge effectively at work. Social interaction mediated the relationship between gamification techniques and knowledge sharing, highlighting the role of collaborative learning environments. These insights offer valuable guidance for corporate instructors and human resource (HR) professionals aiming to develop engaging and personalized training programs that meet diverse employee needs and learning preferences. This study contributes to the theoretical framework of gamification in adult learning and organizational development, paving the way for future research in this dynamic field.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effects of Storytelling Narrated Videos (SNV) on students’ knowledge retention and transferability. A total of 56 students from a university in Indonesia were randomly assigned to a quasi-experimental research design exposed to SNV and to Lecture Narrated Videos (LNV). Two videos were created to deliver content on Bloom’s Taxonomy, one using a lecture-style format and the other adopting a storytelling approach. Data were collected through tests, questionnaires, and essays. The findings revealed that participants exposed to SNV had higher retention memory scores, indicating a positive impact on knowledge retention compared to those who watched LNV. Moreover, the storytelling videos facilitated cognitive skill progression, enhanced understanding through engaging visuals, and fostered a strong connection with a familiar narrator, resulting in a more dynamic and memorable learning experience. The study also examined knowledge transfer and found that participants who watched the storytelling videos performed better in applying Bloom’s Taxonomy concepts to planning teaching objectives in the essay test. This suggests that the incorporation of storytelling narration and promoting transfer knowledge activities can enhance students’ understanding, retention, and practical application of the learned material. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of incorporating storytelling in narrated videos to improve students’ knowledge retention, transferability, and engagement in educational settings.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Dental education assumes an indispensable role in adequately equipping students for a successful career in dentistry. Error-based active learning, an innovative approach in dental education, is a combination of mistake-driven learning (MDL) and case-based learning (CBL) to provide a transformative learning atmosphere for students. While active learning has gained popularity in dental education, the effectiveness of error-based active learning remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of error-based active learning among final-year dental undergraduate students in comparison with the conventional lecture-based approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A parallel-arm single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in a dental institute in India from November 2022 to December 2022. A total of 74 students were randomly allocated to two groups: Group A ( n = 37) received error-based active learning and group B ( n = 37) received conventional lecture-based learning approach. Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) was chosen as the topic for the study. The knowledge of students was assessed at three intervals: baseline, post-intervention, and 4 weeks after the intervention, using a self-designed and validated questionnaire with Cronbach’s alpha of 0.87 and a content validity ratio of 0.84. A standard survey questionnaire was employed to evaluate students’ perceptions of the teaching methods. RESULTS: Error-based active learning group outperformed the lecture-based group significantly in the post-intervention test (20.92 ± 1.42 vs 16.97 ± 3.06), with better knowledge retention (18.30 ± 2.02 vs 14.05 ± 4.26) and positive feedback from the students. CONCLUSIONS: The error-based active learning approach proved superior to the conventional lecture-based method in enhancing and retaining knowledge regarding ART.

Abstract: Introduction Patient education is essential to health care, yet its development often lacks meaningful connection to and incorporation of established learning theories. This study aimed to systematically review evidence surrounding use of learning theories in patient education strategies. Methods A systematic search including terms like ‘learning theory’ and ‘patient education’ was done across five databases including MEDLINE and EBSCO. The main outcomes were knowledge retention or application of knowledge (via clinical outcomes). Results From 4,449 articles, 347 underwent full-text review and 46 were included in data extraction ( figure 1 ). Predominant learning theories reported were Social Learning/Cognitive Theory (72%), and adult learning theory (13%). Most common interventions were group sessions (50%) with discussions (33%). Studies assessed knowledge retention (72%) and application (63%). 83% of studies had a control group and of those, 66% of interventions were better than control. Included studies often did not report the level of detail needed for additional evaluation and had different levels of learning theory integration. On a 5-point scale, only 52% of studies were clear or very clear on their incorporation of learning theories in the intervention. Discussion Significant heterogeneity of the methods and results made it difficult to assess impact of theories/strategies on outcomes. Few education interventions are theory-based, and the extent of theory integration into current studies varied widely. More guidance on the incorporation of learning theories in patient education is essential. Conclusion(s) This study highlights the need for improved guidance in creating quality learning-theory based patient education materials. Abstract 120 Figure 1 PRISMA diagram [Figure omitted.

Abstract: In today’s world, technology plays a significant role in shaping our daily interactions and how we connect with the world. The rapid advancements in technology have influenced many sectors, particularly education, where integrating technology is now seen as essential rather than just a luxury. As a result, the education field has adapted over time to keep up with innovations and their potential to improve the teaching and learning environment. The incorporation of technology into education has evolved from introducing computer systems in classrooms to the adoption of smartboards, tablets, and e-learning platforms. The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has also opened up possibilities for hands-on learning experiences that allow students to explore and practice skills in ways that traditional teaching methods cannot. VR technology enables students to interact with content in a way that fosters a sense of presence and immersion, which can improve knowledge retention. In fields, like science, engineering, medicine, arts, and language learning, VR applications have shown promise in boosting student engagement and enhancing skills within a controlled learning environment. However, the widespread adoption of VR technology in education faces challenges. One significant obstacle is the cost of acquiring VR equipment and software which can strain budgets. Additionally, the availability of high- quality content for VR platforms poses a barrier for educators seeking to integrate VR into their teaching practices. This article delves into the use of Virtual Reality in education, and how VR can influence student learning outcomes in applications such as medicine, science, arts and language learning. Apart from the advantages of VR, the article also discusses the obstacles that are impeding the use of VR in education including concerns about costs, standardizing content and the necessity for training and support for educators. As VR technology advances and becomes widely available, it stands ready to revolutionize the landscape by offering learning opportunities that were previously beyond imagination.

Abstract: In today’s world, technology plays a significant role in shaping our daily interactions and how we connect with the world. The rapid advancements in technology have influenced many sectors, particularly education, where integrating technology is now seen as essential rather than just a luxury. As a result, the education field has adapted over time to keep up with innovations and their potential to improve the teaching and learning environment. The incorporation of technology into education has evolved from introducing computer systems in classrooms to the adoption of smartboards, tablets, and e-learning platforms. The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has also opened up possibilities for hands-on learning experiences that allow students to explore and practice skills in ways that traditional teaching methods cannot. VR technology enables students to interact with content in a way that fosters a sense of presence and immersion, which can improve knowledge retention. In fields, like science, engineering, medicine, arts, and language learning, VR applications have shown promise in boosting student engagement and enhancing skills within a controlled learning environment. However, the widespread adoption of VR technology in education faces challenges. One significant obstacle is the cost of acquiring VR equipment and software which can strain budgets. Additionally, the availability of high-quality content for VR platforms poses a barrier for educators seeking to integrate VR into their teaching practices. This article delves into the use of Virtual Reality in education, and how VR can influence student learning outcomes in applications such as medicine, science, arts and language learning. Apart from the advantages of VR, the article also discusses the obstacles that are impeding the use of VR in education including concerns about costs, standardizing content and the necessity for training and support for educators. As VR technology advances and becomes widely available, it stands ready to revolutionize the landscape by offering learning opportunities that were previously beyond imagination. Through this technology, education can introduce a world of possibilities that nurture curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enthusiasm for learning.

Abstract: The Neonatal Resuscitation Programme (NRP) was first introduced in Malaysia in 1996 to train doctors and nurses working in paediatrics and obstetrics departments who are involved with the care of newborns soon after delivery. Prompt and effective neonatal resuscitation has been documented to reduce mortality and neonatal asphyxia. The programme has been revised every five years and is now in the 8th edition. NRP training was made into a key performance indicator (KPI) by the Ministry of Health in 2016 for all house officers to be trained in this programme during their 2-year posting and this is usually conducted during the paediatric posting. This study aims to evaluate the retention of their knowledge, skills and competency at 3, 6, and 9 months after the initial NRP training.

This study aims to evaluate the retention of their knowledge, skills and competency at 3, 6, and 9 months after the initial NRP training.A total of 34 house officers were enrolled in the study on joining the paediatric unit of Hospital Kulim. They were given the "Textbook of NRP" to prepare for the theory paper that consisted of 30 multiplechoice questions (MCQs). Two to four weeks later they went through a day of training on the resuscitation of the newborn using low-fidelity simulation manikins. They were taught to recognise a newborn who needed resuscitation after delivery, prepared the equipment for resuscitation and learned the skills of resuscitation. The skills included the initial steps, bag valve mask ventilation, intubation, cardiac massage, umbilical vein cannulation and use of medications. They were also taught the performance of objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) A and B. They were evaluated at 3, 6, and 9 months after the completion of their training using the MCQs and the performance checklist in the NRP textbook.

They were evaluated at 3, 6, and 9 months after the completion of their training using the MCQs and the performance checklist in the NRP textbook.The results showed that there was a significant reduction in their knowledge retention as shown by their performance in multiple choice questions. Similarly, there was a significant loss of competency in their skills and competency in resuscitation using bag mask ventilation, intubation and performance of OSCE A and OSCE B. However, their performance at initial steps showed no significant reduction.

Abstract: Guatemalan lay midwives are well-respected community leaders in a country that lacks the institutional capacity to meet healthcare needs related to pregnancy, newborns, and COVID-19. Thus, Guatemalan lay midwives, who attend the majority of births in their country and who attend most births at home, are in an optimal position to offer frontline support to pregnant women and newborns regarding the global pandemic. The primary objective of this program of study was to dispel myths about COVID-19 and to provide culturally relevant educational activities to low-literacy Guatemalan lay midwives about issues related to the virus, such as signs and symptoms, risks to the mother and fetus, which patients are most vulnerable, appropriate responses, benefits and side-effects of the vaccine, timing of the vaccine, how the virus interacts with breastfeeding, and breastfeeding recommendations. INTRODUCTION Guatemalan lay midwives are well-respected community leaders in a country that lacks the institutional capacity to meet healthcare needs related to pregnancy, newborns, and COVID-19. Thus, Guatemalan lay midwives, who attend the majority of births in their country and who attend most births at home, are in an optimal position to offer frontline support to pregnant women and newborns regarding the global pandemic. The primary objective of this program of study was to dispel myths about COVID-19 and to provide culturally relevant educational activities to low-literacy Guatemalan lay midwives about issues related to the virus, such as signs and symptoms, risks to the mother and fetus, which patients are most vulnerable, appropriate responses, benefits and side-effects of the vaccine, timing of the vaccine, how the virus interacts with breastfeeding, and breastfeeding recommendations.In a partnership among the Guatemalan Ministry of Health, expert faculty at the University of Utah College of Nursing, and Madre y Niño, a non-profit organization from the US, evidence-based educational activities about COVID-19 were offered orally in the native language of participants. Two hundred and ten lay midwives attended educational sessions at 11 locations throughout the remote Peten department. Educational activities included repetition, storytelling, and role plays. A pretest-post-test evaluation of 10 questions with 24 correct answers was used to determine if the educational activities changed lay midwife knowledge about COVID-19. Participants were given essential birth supplies and laminated COVID Reminder Cards, which were designed to increase visual literacy, to encourage knowledge retention after the educational sessions.

Participants were given essential birth supplies and laminated COVID Reminder Cards, which were designed to increase visual literacy, to encourage knowledge retention after the educational sessions.Participants showed a significant increase in knowledge scores (possible 0-24) from prescores 7.09 (standard deviation (SD)=3.06) to 15.20 (SD=4.61), Student's t-test p<0.001. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of participants mistakenly thought COVID-19 passed through breast milk on the pretest (70.1%) compared to post-test (8.4%) (McNemar test, p<0.001). Regarding breastfeeding, 12.6% of participants knew on the pretest that women with COVID-19 who breastfeed should wear a mask and wash their hands compared to 74.3% of participants who knew these recommendations on the post-test (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001). Finally, 2% of participants knew on the pretest that pregnant women with COVID-19 should take a low-dose aspirin compared to 67% of participants on the post-test (χ² (1)=194.7, p<0.001). RESULTS Participants showed a significant increase in knowledge scores (possible 0-24) from prescores 7.09 (standard deviation (SD)=3.06) to 15.20 (SD=4.61), Student's t-test p<0.001.

Culturally relevant educational activities provided orally in the native language of participants dispelled myths about the virus and significantly improved lay midwife knowledge. Providing evidence-based educational activities in a culturally relevant format is critical to protecting remote, vulnerable populations, such as pregnant Guatemalan women and newborns, during a global pandemic.

Abstract: The traditional wisdom of the people of Kampung Adat Miduana in utilizing plant resources as medicine is something that needs to be studied to remain sustainable. Educational tourism of medicinal plants can be an alternative to reduce the loss of knowledge about traditional medicinal plants and threats to diversity in it. The purpose of this study is to identify the types, benefits, and processing methods as well as local wisdom regarding the use of medicinal plants in the Miduana Traditional Village community. The data collection methods used were literature studies, field surveys, and interviews. The data analysis used was the characteristics of respondents, characteristics of medicinal plants, grouping of diseases, as well as the potential for sustainable management and conservation status of medicinal plants. Based on the results of the study, there are 106 plant species belonging to 47 families. The processing of these plants mostly uses the boiled method and found some herbs by boiling method. Local wisdom found in the community of Kampung Adat Miduana in the form of herbs and traditional medicine using leuhang and the system of inheriting knowledge from generation to generation and using the karuhun system.

Abstract: Background Semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD) is a neurodegenerative condition presenting with specific behavioral and semantic derangements and predominant atrophy of the right anterior temporal lobe (ATL). The objective was to evaluate clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and genetic features of an Italian sbvFTD cohort, defined according to recently proposed guidelines, compared to semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) patients. Methods Fifteen sbvFTD, sixty-three bvFTD, and twenty-five svPPA patients and forty controls were enrolled. Patients underwent clinical, cognitive evaluations, and brain MRI. Symptoms of bvFTD patients between onset and first visit were retrospectively recorded and classified as early and late. Grey matter atrophy was investigated using voxel-based morphometry. Results sbvFTD experienced early criteria-specific symptoms: world, object and person-specific semantic loss (67%), complex compulsions and rigid thought (60%). Sequentially, more behavioral symptoms emerged (apathy/inertia, loss of empathy) along with non-criteria-specific symptoms (anxiety, suspiciousness). sbvFTD showed sparing of attentive/executive functions, especially compared to bvFTD and better language functions compared to svPPA. All sbvFTD patients failed at the famous face recognition test and more than 80% failed in understanding written metaphors and humor. At MRI, sbvFTD had predominant right ATL atrophy, almost specular to svPPA. Three sbvFTD patients presented pathogenic genetic variants. Conclusion We replicated the application of sbvFTD diagnostic guidelines in an independent Italian cohort, demonstrating that the presence of person-specific semantic knowledge loss and mental rigidity, along with preserved executive functions and a predominant right ATL atrophy with sparing of frontal lobes, should prompt a diagnosis of sbvFTD.

Abstract: The frequent contacts between police and people with disabilities has only recently led to research on developing law enforcement knowledge and skills in improving those interactions. While past studies have focused primarily on knowledge retention by disability-awareness training participants, we examine how training as well as personal and on-duty experiences contribute to police officer self-confidence in approaching a disabled person when dispatched to distinct scenarios. The findings not only support the positive role of disability-awareness training on officer confidence, but also suggest that on-duty experiences with disabled persons also has a critical role in forming those attitudes. The study’s finding of a joint role for training and experience suggests police education should integrate experiential approaches to pre-service training to prepare officers through in-person or simulated interactions with different disabled communities.

Abstract: Emergency physicians and trainees provide the initial care for critically ill patients. In times of emergency department boarding, this care may extend beyond the first few hours. To meet the needs of this population, a standardized novel critical care curriculum targeting third- and fourth-year medical students was developed. BACKGROUND Emergency physicians and trainees provide the initial care for critically ill patients. In times of emergency department boarding, this care may extend beyond the first few hours. To meet the needs of this population, a standardized novel critical care curriculum targeting third- and fourth-year medical students was developed.We hypothesized that the institution of such a curriculum is feasible and will provide an increased understanding of the underlying critical care principles within this learner population. OBJECTIVES We hypothesized that the institution of such a curriculum is feasible and will provide an increased understanding of the underlying critical care principles within this learner population.We developed a 2-month-long critical care curriculum (February-April) and carried out the course twice from 2022-2023. Our pilot study deployed this curriculum to medical students interested in critical care through the American Academy of Emergency Medicine/Resident and Student Association. The primary outcome included was the overall composite score comparison of the pre- and post-course evaluations, with a higher score indicating that the student improved their comprehension. Secondary outcomes included the individual factors of the pre- and post-course surveys. METHODS We developed a 2-month-long critical care curriculum (February-April) and carried out the course twice from 2022-2023. Our pilot study deployed this curriculum to medical students interested in critical care through the American Academy of Emergency Medicine/Resident and Student Association. The primary outcome included was the overall composite score comparison of the pre- and post-course evaluations, with a higher score indicating that the student improved their comprehension. Secondary outcomes included the individual factors of the pre- and post-course surveys.Fifty-one trainees completed the pilot course, including 11/51 (21.6%) third-year medical students and 40/51 (78.4%) fourth-year medical students. Overall, 39 had "no experience" in critical care and 12 indicated that they had "previous experience." The students' baseline pre-course from the pooled 2022 and 2023 Introduction to Critical Care in Emergency Medicine (ICCEM) curriculum data was 3 (interquartile range 4-3) and their post-course score was 9 (interquartile range 9-9), p-value 0.015 for the 51/54 students who completed the course. RESULTS Fifty-one trainees completed the pilot course, including 11/51 (21.6%) third-year medical students and 40/51 (78.4%) fourth-year medical students. Overall, 39 had "no experience" in critical care and 12 indicated that they had "previous experience."

As such, it indicated that a critical care fundamentals course improves confidence in these topics for students with and without prior experience. Further work is necessary to understand the generalizability and knowledge retention of the proposed pilot curriculum.

Abstract: Semantic behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (sbvFTD) is a neurodegenerative condition presenting with specific behavioral and semantic derangements and predominant atrophy of the right anterior temporal lobe (ATL).

All sbvFTD patients failed at the famous face recognition test and more than 80% failed in understanding written metaphors and humor. At MRI, sbvFTD had predominant right ATL atrophy, almost specular to svPPA. Three sbvFTD patients presented pathogenic genetic variants.We replicated the application of sbvFTD diagnostic guidelines in an independent Italian cohort, demonstrating that the presence of person-specific semantic knowledge loss and mental rigidity, along with preserved executive functions and a predominant right ATL atrophy with sparing of frontal lobes, should prompt a diagnosis of sbvFTD. CONCLUSION We replicated the application of sbvFTD diagnostic guidelines in an independent Italian cohort, demonstrating that the presence of person-specific semantic knowledge loss and mental rigidity, along with preserved executive functions and a predominant right ATL atrophy with sparing of frontal lobes, should prompt a diagnosis of sbvFTD.

Abstract: Initiating antineoplastic therapy can be distressful and affect patient retention of treatment-related side effects and safety protocols. Return visits can range from 8 to 28 days after treatment, during which patients may develop treatment-related questions and toxicities. This study's objective is to evaluate how implementing a follow-up phone call 24-48 hours after initial antineoplastic infusion, compared with standard pretreatment education, affects patient satisfaction and education retention. PURPOSE Initiating antineoplastic therapy can be distressful and affect patient retention of treatment-related side effects and safety protocols. Return visits can range from 8 to 28 days after treatment, during which patients may develop treatment-related questions and toxicities. This study's objective is to evaluate how implementing a follow-up phone call 24-48 hours after initial antineoplastic infusion, compared with standard pretreatment education, affects patient satisfaction and education retention.We conducted a single-center pilot study where patients who were literate, English-speaking, with genitourinary malignancies, initiating intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy were eligible. The primary end point was patient knowledge retention. Secondary end points included patient satisfaction. The Leuven's Questionnaire Patient Knowledge Tool, a validated, standardized tool, was used to evaluate patient knowledge retention, with a higher score indicating more retention. Telephone follow-up was initiated 24-48 hours after initial infusion, where Leuven's Questionnaire was used to assess patient knowledge. A nurse then reinforced treatment-related education, reviewed notification parameters, and coordinated appropriate follow-up. One week later, participants were sent a follow-up Leuven's Questionnaire and standardized patient satisfaction assessment.

Abstract: Sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and human trafficking are traumatic events for individuals and communities. As healthcare shortages increase, critical access hospitals must manage resources to ensure comprehensive forensic care effectively. Current literature indicates a lack of forensic healthcare education for providers within critical access hospitals. This forensic education module for critical access healthcare providers aimed to (a) increase forensic examination competencies, (b) improve forensic interviewing skills, (c) increase provider self-efficacy, and (d) show knowledge retention.

METHODS This mixed-methods pilot study utilized a convenience sample of 45 healthcare providers in Nebraska critical access hospitals who presented for the forensic education module training. Repeated measures analysis of variance and paired t tests assessed the aims of this study. Structured surveys gathered qualitative data on three themes.Implementation of the forensic education module showed a statistically significant increase in forensic interviewing skills, nonstatistically significant changes in general self-efficacy, and sustainability of knowledge and self-efficacy over 6 weeks. Analysis also showed a clinically significant increase in provider self-efficacy over 6 weeks. Structured questionnaire responses showed participants valued the content to address their perceived barriers to providing care. RESULTS Implementation of the forensic education module showed a statistically significant increase in forensic interviewing skills, nonstatistically significant changes in general self-efficacy, and sustainability of knowledge and self-efficacy over 6 weeks. Analysis also showed a clinically significant increase in provider self-efficacy over 6 weeks. Structured questionnaire responses showed participants valued the content to address their perceived barriers to providing care.This study validates the need for increased education in Nebraska's rural and medically underserved areas to ensure access to forensic care and provision of services. This pilot study shows the potential for forensic education interventions to increase provider competencies and improve provider self-efficacy, with evidence of retention of knowledge and skills. CONCLUSIONS This study validates the need for increased education in Nebraska's rural and medically underserved areas to ensure access to forensic care and provision of services. This pilot study shows the potential for forensic education interventions to increase provider competencies and improve provider self-efficacy, with evidence of retention of knowledge and skills.

Abstract: The frequent contacts between police and people with disabilities has only recently led to research on developing law enforcement knowledge and skills in improving those interactions. While past studies have focused primarily on knowledge retention by disability-awareness training participants, we examine how training as well as personal and on-duty experiences contribute to police officer self-confidence in approaching a disabled person when dispatched to distinct scenarios. The findings not only support the positive role of disability-awareness training on officer confidence, but also suggest that on-duty experiences with disabled persons also has a critical role in forming those attitudes. The study’s finding of a joint role for training and experience suggests police education should integrate experiential approaches to pre-service training to prepare officers through in-person or simulated interactions with different disabled communities.

Abstract: Background The voices virtual on‐screen characters use has been shown to impact learning and perception outcomes. Recent replication research on these voices showed that synthetic voices were not a detriment if produced by a high‐quality engine with clear articulation. The current manuscript examines previous accent research that utilized now outdated engines, to determine if the impact of accents still holds with high‐quality engines and voice actors. Objectives To investigate the impact on learning and perceptions with pedagogical agents speaking in accented voices, synthetic voices, and the interaction between the two using modern voice engines. Methods This study is a between‐subjects two (accent) by two (type) factorial design to determine the impact the voice accent, voice type, and the interaction have on learning retention, learning transfer, mental effort efficiency, and perception measures. 197 participants were recruited from the online Amazon's Mechanical Turk with qualifications of 18 years of age, “normal or corrected‐to‐normal hearing”, and located with the continental United States of America. Results and Conclusions There were no significant differences between the accented conditions or interaction effects, deviating from previous research that showed impact of accents on learning. The synthetic condition had significantly lower knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, mental effort efficiency, and perception measures than the human professional. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering voice quality when designing pedagogical agents. Previous research showed synthetic voices perform as well as the average voice, and this research continues the narrative of voice quality by showing professional recordings outperform modern synthetic engines.

Abstract: The present retrospective, descriptive, and quasi‐experimental study aimed to explore students' perceptions of traditional teaching combined with gamified and nongamified e‐tests for postlecture reinforcement. Midterm knowledge retention and academic performance were also analyzed. The study was conducted from February 2021 to May 2022, involving a single group of first‐year medical and physiotherapy students enrolled in equivalent core subjects on human histology at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). Lectures were supplemented with gamified Quizizz (QQ) or nongamified Moodle questionnaires (MQ) after lecture ( t0 ) and 30 days later ( t30 ). From 171 attendees, 162 volunteers were surveyed on their perceptions on the experience. Furthermore, 97 volunteers participated in the DOCENTIA‐ULPGC survey on the students' satisfaction, and 123 participants individually answered 20 QQ and 20 MQ. Data were analyzed using the program Jamovi 2.3.24. The survey on volunteers' perception comprised 11 Likert items and 3 numerical scale items. The former showed acceptable internal consistency (ω‐McDonald, 0.70) and validity (KMO, 0.58). Both types of e‐questionnaires facilitated learning and motivated pre‐reading contents but QQs were preferred. Reinforced lectures were rated higher than those unreinforced. Volunteers expressed higher overall satisfaction though DOCENTIA‐ULPGC survey than the prepandemic control group. Average scores peaked at t0 with higher MQ rates. At t30, MQ and QQ scores were acceptable and similar. Participants' outcomes in the final exam tended to improve compared to the prepandemic control group, but without statistical significance. In summary, gamified and nongamified e‐quizzes enhanced the student satisfaction and motivation and facilitated midterm knowledge retention.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Arctic Indigenous food systems are typified by diverse social interactions that maintain food security. Given the numerous challenges Arctic Indigenous communities face, it is important to understand diversity in these systems and how they are impacted by change. This study adopts a mixed methods approach that combines participatory methods with network analysis to assess the diversity of food-related interactions between different actor types in the mixed food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska. We conducted 36 interviews with local food system actors to identify current food security challenges and food-related interactions in the local food system. We used network analysis to investigate the diversity of interactions in the food system quantitatively. We simulated the effects of two key food security challenges (out-migration and knowledge loss) on food system diversity and explored interventions to increase diversity. Qualitative data from the same interviews were used to embed our results in the lived realities of the St. Paul Island community. Our approach reveals diverse interactions in the local food system, reflecting both subsistence and market-based elements of the St. Paul Island mixed economy. While both challenges threaten the system's diversity, out-migration presents a more immediate risk to food system diversity than knowledge loss. We advocate for targeting a combination of food system interventions at the community level to enhance food system diversity effectively. Our research contributes to understanding the importance of diversity for Arctic Indigenous food security and emphasizes the need to recognize the complex interactions between food system interventions and their implications for Arctic Indigenous communities.

Abstract: One Health problem-based learning (PBL) is known as an effective method in teaching zoonotic diseases. However, the classic classroom setting limits real-life exposure for students. Simulation-based learning may improve the learning experience without exposing the students to unnecessary risks. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of field simulation PBL compared to a classic classroom setting using a module developed based on the One Health concept by examining the students' reactions to the learning and by assessing the students' performance. A quasi-experimental design was adopted in this study. Veterinary and medical undergraduate students participated in both types of PBL settings, and their knowledge and satisfaction were evaluated through a pre- and post-test as well as a feedback survey. The mean satisfaction score of students undergoing field simulation was significantly higher than the mean satisfaction score of students undergoing classic PBL ( p > .05). The respondents from both programs found the field simulation, in comparison to classic PBL, was more effective, and they were more satisfied with the overall learning experience, workloads, and facilitation. The attainment of the cognitive domain was comparable between both PBL groups, which was possibly due to the type of assessment used. In conclusion, field simulation enhanced the students' positive learning experiences as they exhibited better attitudes toward learning. Future studies on the impact of the simulation on long-term knowledge retention and psychomotor skills are thus warranted.One Health problem-based learning (PBL) is known as an effective method in teaching zoonotic diseases.

Abstract: This study investigates the transformative potential of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), animation, and personalized learning in contemporary education. Employing a mixed-methods approach involving interviews and experimental manipulations, the research examines the interconnectedness of these three domains and their collective impact on student engagement and English reading comprehension learning outcomes. The study employed a quasi-experimental design. Participants engaged in an 8-week AI-driven personalized learning intervention that incorporated animated content, with pre- and post-test assessments evaluating reading comprehension outcomes. Qualitative data from interviews provided further insight into the impact of animation and personalized learning on student engagement and comprehension. Findings reveal that AI-driven personalized learning, coupled with engaging animations, leads to enhanced learner motivation, improved knowledge retention, and higher academic performance. The integration of these elements creates an inclusive and adaptable learning environment, addressing the diverse needs of students. This research highlights the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration in educational innovation and emphasizes the vast potential that lies at the intersection of AI, animation, and personalized learning to revolutionize 21st-century education.

Abstract: After the pandemic, research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the field of education has seen a significant increase global ly. However, a few studies conducted before the pandemic addressed the problem of supporting intrinsic motivation in students, crucial for the quality of learning and knowledge retention. This study explores how this topic is covered in recent research, by conducting a cross-disciplinary literature review and critical discourse analysis under the theoretical framework of Activity Theory (AT). It aims to identify the coverage extension of all types of relationships between nodes in the educational activity system, with special attention to Subject (students) and Object, as this central relationship embodies the motive-driven nature of human activity. The analysis incorporated 69 articles from Scopus published from 2020 until now. The results demonstrate the coverage about only some relationships like: Subject-Tools (students' interaction with AI technology), Tools-Object (AI technologies development), and Tools-Community (adapting AI within an educational community). The Subject-Object relationship remains unexplored. Practical implications include refocusing on intrinsic motivation, emphasising epistemological needs, meaning, and choice. This involves evaluating the benefits and risks of AI in specific educational cases. Theoretical implications involve exploring how to sustain students' intrinsic motivation in the context of AI implementation. Alternate abstract: Després de la pandèmia, la investigació sobre Intel.ligència Artificial (IA) en educació ha augmentat a nivell mundial. Pocs estudis abans de la pandèmia van abordar la motivació intrínseca als estudiants, crucial per a la retenció del coneixement. Aquest estudi analitza com es tracta aquest tema en investigacions recents, fent una revisió de la literatura i una anàlisi crítica del discurs sota el marc teòric de la Teoria de l'Activitat (AT). L'objectiu és identificar la cobertura de les relacions entre nodes al sistema d'activitat educativa, amb especial atenció al subjecte (estudiants) i l'objecte, que reflecteix la naturalesa motivada de l'activitat humana. L'anàlisi va incloure 69 articles de Scopus publicats des del 2020. Els resultats mostren la cobertura d'algunes relacions, com Subjecte-Eines (interacció dels estudiants amb IA), Eines-Objecte (desenvolupament d'IA) i Eines-Comunitat (adaptació de la IA) a la comunitat educativa). La relació Subjecte-Objecte roman inexplorada. Les implicacions pràctiques inclouen un reenfocament en la motivació intrínseca, emfatitzant necessitats epistemològiques, significat i elecció, avaluant els beneficis i els riscos de la IA en casos educatius específics. Les implicacions teòriques impliquen explorar com mantenir la motivació intrínseca dels estudiants en el context de la implementació de IA.

Abstract: Despite rising costs of health care, physician awareness of costs remains poor. Educational initiatives to remedy this have shown promise, with gamification specifically having success, but actual improvements in physician estimation capabilities have yet to be evaluated. Background Despite rising costs of health care, physician awareness of costs remains poor. Educational initiatives to remedy this have shown promise, with gamification specifically having success, but actual improvements in physician estimation capabilities have yet to be evaluated.The objective of the study was to assess a gamified educational session for emergency medicine residents that improved their ability to estimate the costs of tests or services commonly performed in their department. Objectives The objective of the study was to assess a gamified educational session for emergency medicine residents that improved their ability to estimate the costs of tests or services commonly performed in their department.Participants completed an anonymous presession survey consisting of demographic data, self-analysis on cost awareness, and a 10-item cost estimation list. This was followed by a 1-h interactive gamified education session utilizing rules from the television show The Price is Right . During this session, only three of the survey items had their cost directly discussed such that the remaining seven were able to be assessed solely on estimation improvement instead of short-term knowledge retention. Participants then completed the same survey to assess for improvement in cost awareness. Methods Participants completed an anonymous presession survey consisting of demographic data, self-analysis on cost awareness, and a 10-item cost estimation list. This was followed by a 1-h interactive gamified education session utilizing rules from the television show The Price is Right. During this session, only three of the survey items had their cost directly discussed such that the remaining seven were able to be assessed solely on estimation improvement instead of short-term knowledge retention. Participants then completed the same survey to assess for improvement in cost awareness.Sixteen residents at the PGY-2 or PGY-3 level completed the surveys and education session. All self-analysis questions showed significant improvement in the postsession survey. Eight out of the 10 items had significant differences in cost estimation. Results Sixteen residents at the PGY-2 or PGY-3 level completed the surveys and education session. All self-analysis questions showed significant improvement in the postsession survey. Eight out of the 10 items had significant differences in cost estimation.A gamified teaching session using The Price is Right rules can improve a resident's estimation capabilities, even on items not directly taught during the session. Conclusions A gamified teaching session using The Price is Right rules can improve a resident's estimation capabilities, even on items not directly taught during the session.

Abstract: In search of a way to bring back the positive aspects of an internship into the curriculum, TU Delft identified serious games as a potential solution. The literature studied showed that games could increase motivation and understanding, leading to improve knowledge retention. This paper has brought these insights together in a framework identifying the benefits that contribute to knowledge retention but also the requirements and risks for the application of serious games to be addressed. These insights were used to explain the success of a longstanding business game course for advanced students first. Next was the development of a virtual reality practice in a first-year course to replace the lost internship. In this case, knowledge retention was improved significantly, albeit only by 5%. Furthermore, in light of the developed framework, the VR simulation is a more balanced approach with fewer risks compared to the more extensive master course.

Abstract: The present retrospective, descriptive, and quasi‐experimental study aimed to explore students' perceptions of traditional teaching combined with gamified and nongamified e‐tests for postlecture reinforcement. Midterm knowledge retention and academic performance were also analyzed. The study was conducted from February 2021 to May 2022, involving a single group of first‐year medical and physiotherapy students enrolled in equivalent core subjects on human histology at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). Lectures were supplemented with gamified Quizizz (QQ) or nongamified Moodle questionnaires (MQ) after lecture ( t 0) and 30 days later ( t 30). From 171 attendees, 162 volunteers were surveyed on their perceptions on the experience. Furthermore, 97 volunteers participated in the DOCENTIA‐ULPGC survey on the students' satisfaction, and 123 participants individually answered 20 QQ and 20 MQ. Data were analyzed using the program Jamovi 2.3.24. The survey on volunteers' perception comprised 11 Likert items and 3 numerical scale items. The former showed acceptable internal consistency (ω‐McDonald, 0.70) and validity (KMO, 0.58). Both types of e‐questionnaires facilitated learning and motivated pre‐reading contents but QQs were preferred. Reinforced lectures were rated higher than those unreinforced. Volunteers expressed higher overall satisfaction though DOCENTIA‐ULPGC survey than the prepandemic control group. Average scores peaked at t 0 with higher MQ rates. At t 30, MQ and QQ scores were acceptable and similar. Participants' outcomes in the final exam tended to improve compared to the prepandemic control group, but without statistical significance. In summary, gamified and nongamified e‐quizzes enhanced the student satisfaction and motivation and facilitated midterm knowledge retention.

Abstract: Arctic Indigenous food systems are typified by diverse social interactions that maintain food security. Given the numerous challenges Arctic Indigenous communities face, it is important to understand diversity in these systems and how they are impacted by change. This study adopts a mixed methods approach that combines participatory methods with network analysis to assess the diversity of food-related interactions between different actor types in the mixed food system on St. Paul Island, Alaska. We conducted 36 interviews with local food system actors to identify current food security challenges and food-related interactions in the local food system. We used network analysis to investigate the diversity of interactions in the food system quantitatively. We simulated the effects of two key food security challenges (out-migration and knowledge loss) on food system diversity and explored interventions to increase diversity. Qualitative data from the same interviews were used to embed our results in the lived realities of the St. Paul Island community. Our approach reveals diverse interactions in the local food system, reflecting both subsistence and market-based elements of the St. Paul Island mixed economy. While both challenges threaten the system's diversity, out-migration presents a more immediate risk to food system diversity than knowledge loss. We advocate for targeting a combination of food system interventions at the community level to enhance food system diversity effectively. Our research contributes to understanding the importance of diversity for Arctic Indigenous food security and emphasizes the need to recognize the complex interactions between food system interventions and their implications for Arctic Indigenous communities.

Abstract: Introduction In 2015, our university hospital pharmacy acquired the PharmaHelp robot system to automate part of its chemotherapy production. Complex technical use, downtime periods, and insufficient training caused a drop in motivation and disparities in operators’ knowledge. We created a short, playful, standardized, gamed-based training program to address this, and evaluated its impact. Methods Operators were classified as trainers or trainees according to their knowledge about Information and Communication Technologies. Before, after the training, and at 6 months (6M), their robot knowledge was assessed on a 0-24-scale, motivation and self-efficacy in using it on 0-to-100 scales. Pairwise comparison t -test with Bonferroni adjustment was used ( p    0.1 compared to pretraining) ( t -test). Conclusions This highly appreciated training program efficiently improved knowledge retention out to six months.

Abstract: Background: Stroke simulation-based training has been associated with improved stroke quality metrics. The purpose of this study was to assess whether high-fidelity acute stroke simulation participation led to better knowledge retention one month post simulation in off-service residents. Methods: Off-service residents were provided with non-mandatory pre-simulation pre-reading on stroke. Immediately before stroke simulation, they completed a questionnaire to test their knowledge on a set of 8 questions related to stroke. Immediately post-stroke simulation, they were provided with a debrief including teaching on stroke. After the debrief and one month later, they completed the same questionnaire again. Results: There were a total of 16 off-service resident participants. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was performed. There was a significant difference between pre-simulation and immediate post-simulation scores on the knowledge retention questionnaire (p = 0.008). There was a significant difference between pre-simulation and one-month post-simulation on the knowledge retention questionnaire (p = 0.007). There was no difference between immediate post-simulation and one-month post-simulation on the knowledge retention questionnaire (p = 0.77). Conclusions: Participants performed better on the questionnaire after the simulation, and this improved performance was retained at one month. This is the first study to demonstrate delayed knowledge retention in stroke simulation literature.

Abstract: The neonatal phase is vital for child survival, with a substantial portion of deaths occurring in the first month. Neonatal mortality rates differ significantly between Vietnam (10.52/1000 live births) and the United States (3.27/1000). In response to these challenges, interventions such as the Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) program have emerged, aiming to enhance the quality of care provided during childbirth, and the postpartum period in low-resource settings. BACKGROUND The neonatal phase is vital for child survival, with a substantial portion of deaths occurring in the first month. Neonatal mortality rates differ significantly between Vietnam (10.52/1000 live births) and the United States (3.27/1000). In response to these challenges, interventions such as the Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) program have emerged, aiming to enhance the quality of care provided during childbirth, and the postpartum period in low-resource settings.The purpose of this study was to explore stakeholder perceptions of the HBB program in Vietnam postpandemic, aiming to identify requisites for resuming training. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to explore stakeholder perceptions of the HBB program in Vietnam postpandemic, aiming to identify requisites for resuming training.Utilizing qualitative content analysis, 19 in-person semistructured interviews were conducted with diverse stakeholders in 2 provinces of Central Vietnam. METHODS Utilizing qualitative content analysis, 19 in-person semistructured interviews were conducted with diverse stakeholders in 2 provinces of Central Vietnam.The content analysis revealed following 5 main themes: (1) the pandemic's impact on HBB training; (2) resource needs for scaling up HBB training as the pandemic abates; (3) participants' perceptions of the pandemic's effect on HBB skills and knowledge; (4) the pandemic's influence on a skilled neonatal resuscitation workforce; and (5) future prospects and challenges for HBB training in a postpandemic era. RESULTS The content analysis revealed following 5 main themes: (1) the pandemic's impact on HBB training; (2) resource needs for scaling up HBB training as the pandemic abates; (3) participants' perceptions of the pandemic's effect on HBB skills and knowledge; (4) the pandemic's influence on a skilled neonatal resuscitation workforce; and (5) future prospects and challenges for HBB training in a postpandemic era.This research highlights the importance of sustainable post-HBB training competencies, including skill assessment, innovative knowledge retention strategies, community-based initiatives, and evidence-based interventions for improved healthcare decision-making and patient outcomes. Healthcare institutions should prioritize skill assessments, refresher training, and collaborative efforts among hospitals, authorities, non-government organizations, and community organizations for evidence-based education and HBB implementation. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH This research highlights the importance of sustainable post-HBB training competencies, including skill assessment, innovative knowledge retention strategies, community-based initiatives, and evidence-based interventions for improved healthcare decision-making and patient outcomes.

Abstract: The present retrospective, descriptive, and quasi-experimental study aimed to explore students' perceptions of traditional teaching combined with gamified and nongamified e-tests for postlecture reinforcement. Midterm knowledge retention and academic performance were also analyzed. The study was conducted from February 2021 to May 2022, involving a single group of first-year medical and physiotherapy students enrolled in equivalent core subjects on human histology at the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC). Lectures were supplemented with gamified Quizizz (QQ) or nongamified Moodle questionnaires (MQ) after lecture (t0) and 30 days later (t30). From 171 attendees, 162 volunteers were surveyed on their perceptions on the experience. Furthermore, 97 volunteers participated in the DOCENTIA-ULPGC survey on the students' satisfaction, and 123 participants individually answered 20 QQ and 20 MQ. Data were analyzed using the program Jamovi 2.3.24. The survey on volunteers' perception comprised 11 Likert items and 3 numerical scale items. The former showed acceptable internal consistency (ω-McDonald, 0.70) and validity (KMO, 0.58). Both types of e-questionnaires facilitated learning and motivated pre-reading contents but QQs were preferred. Reinforced lectures were rated higher than those unreinforced. Volunteers expressed higher overall satisfaction though DOCENTIA-ULPGC survey than the prepandemic control group. Average scores peaked at t0 with higher MQ rates. At t30, MQ and QQ scores were acceptable and similar. Participants' outcomes in the final exam tended to improve compared to the prepandemic control group, but without statistical significance. In summary, gamified and nongamified e-quizzes enhanced the student satisfaction and motivation and facilitated midterm knowledge retention.The present retrospective, descriptive, and quasi-experimental study aimed to explore students' perceptions of traditional teaching combined with gamified and nongamified e-tests for postlecture reinforcement.

In summary, gamified and nongamified e-quizzes enhanced the student satisfaction and motivation and facilitated midterm knowledge retention.

Abstract: Employee mobility (EM) provides organizations with enhanced performance, value creation, innovation, and creativity. However, EM plays a frequently indicated but less emphasized role in an organization's knowledge. The existing body of EM research is characterized by diverse perspectives and contradictory findings, creating a significant gap in our understanding of how organizations can effectively access and leverage the critical knowledge carried by employees. This integrative review aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing diverse mobility perspectives, delving into theoretical underpinnings, and exploring the dynamics of knowledge flow. The review is guided by the two research questions: (1) How is EM conceptualized as a knowledge flow mechanism in the existing literature? and (2) What mechanisms can organizations employ to use EM as a knowledge development strategy? Through a comprehensive analysis, we present a framework encompassing seven strategies: knowledge dissemination, knowledge creation, knowledge combination, knowledge adoption, knowledge spill-in, knowledge retention, and knowledge protection. This framework contributes to the understanding that organizations can use internal mobility to disseminate embedded knowledge and create new knowledge. Inward mobility plays a crucial role in enabling organizations to combine (similar) knowledge and adopt specific knowledge from external sources. Interestingly, outward mobility, despite the loss of employees, serves as a mechanism of reverse knowledge flow. Additionally, organizations employ strategies to control outward mobility by retaining and protecting critical knowledge. Building on the identified strategies, the paper suggests promising avenues for further research, thereby paving the way for scholars and practitioners to consider EM as a knowledge development strategy.

Abstract: This study compared the effectiveness of traditional lectures and microvideos in teaching baclofen pump programming and refilling to physicians who have completed less than 10 refills for the previous 2 yrs. OBJECTIVE This study compared the effectiveness of traditional lectures and microvideos in teaching baclofen pump programming and refilling to physicians who have completed less than 10 refills for the previous 2 yrs.A mixed-method approach was used with 60 participating physicians specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation or pain management. Preintervention and postintervention assessments were conducted using a rubric, and the participants' perceptions and preferences were gathered through focus group sessions. DESIGN A mixed-method approach was used with 60 participating physicians specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation or pain management. Preintervention and postintervention assessments were conducted using a rubric, and the participants' perceptions and preferences were gathered through focus group sessions.Two thirds of the participants specialized in physical medicine and rehabilitation. No significant differences in the preintervention, postintervention, or knowledge retention scores were found between the traditional lecture and microvideo groups. Both methods demonstrated comparable effectiveness in improving the baclofen pump refilling and programming skills. Qualitatively, participants perceived both approaches as equally helpful, but those in the microvideo group raised concerns because of instructors' unavailability and online platform navigation. Nevertheless, they preferred the convenience, accessibility, and time efficiency of the microvideos. RESULTS Two thirds of the participants specialized in physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Abstract: In 2015, our university hospital pharmacy acquired the PharmaHelp robot system to automate part of its chemotherapy production. Complex technical use, downtime periods, and insufficient training caused a drop in motivation and disparities in operators' knowledge. We created a short, playful, standardized, gamed-based training program to address this, and evaluated its impact. INTRODUCTION In 2015, our university hospital pharmacy acquired the PharmaHelp robot system to automate part of its chemotherapy production. Complex technical use, downtime periods, and insufficient training caused a drop in motivation and disparities in operators' knowledge. We created a short, playful, standardized, gamed-based training program to address this, and evaluated its impact.Operators were classified as trainers or trainees according to their knowledge about Information and Communication Technologies. Before, after the training, and at 6 months (6M), their robot knowledge was assessed on a 0-24-scale, motivation and self-efficacy in using it on 0-to-100 scales. Pairwise comparison t -test with Bonferroni adjustment was used ( p    0.1 compared to pretraining) ( t -test). RESULTS Participants (n  =  14) were very satisfied about sessions' interactivity and playfulness. Knowledge improved from 57% pretraining to 77% (p   0.1 compared to pretraining) (t-test).This highly appreciated training program efficiently improved knowledge retention out to six months. CONCLUSIONS This highly appreciated training program efficiently improved knowledge retention out to six months.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel transfer learning regularization method based on knowledge distillation. Recently, transfer learning methods have been used in various fields. However, problems such as knowledge loss still occur during the process of transfer learning to a new target dataset. To solve these problems, there are various regularization methods based on knowledge distillation techniques. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning regularization method based on feature map alignment used in the field of knowledge distillation. The proposed method is composed of two attention-based submodules: self-pixel attention (SPA) and global channel attention (GCA). The self-pixel attention submodule utilizes both the feature maps of the source and target models, so that it provides an opportunity to jointly consider the features of the target and the knowledge of the source. The global channel attention submodule determines the importance of channels through all layers, unlike the existing methods that calculate these only within a single layer. Accordingly, transfer learning regularization is performed by considering both the interior of each single layer and the depth of the entire layer. Consequently, the proposed method using both of these submodules showed overall improved classification accuracy than the existing methods in classification experiments on commonly used datasets.The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel transfer learning regularization method based on knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients. INTRODUCTION Education of patients prior to an invasive procedure is pivotal for good cooperation and knowledge retention. Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology that helps educate both medical professionals and patients.To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM). OBJECTIVE To prove non-inferiority of VR education compared to conventional education in patients prior to the implantation of a permanent pacemaker (PPM).150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group ( n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group ( n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction. METHODS 150 participants scheduled for an elective implantation of a PPM were enrolled in this prospective study and randomized into two groups: the VR group (n = 75) watched a 360° video about the procedure using the VR headset Oculus Meta Quest 2, while the conventional group (n = 75) was educated by a physician. Both groups filled out a questionnaire to assess the quality of education pre- and in-hospital, their knowledge of the procedure, and their subjective satisfaction.There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the quality of education. There was a non-significant trend towards higher educational scores in the VR group. The subgroup with worse scores was older than the groups with higher scores (82 vs. 76 years, p = 0.025). Anxiety was reduced in 92% of participants.VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects. CONCLUSION VR proved to be non-inferior to conventional education. It helped to reduce anxiety and showed no adverse effects.

Abstract: Objective: This randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of an online ergonomics training program with a digital human compared to an online ergonomics training program without a digital human. Method: Remote office workers ( n = 138) were randomly assigned to either a digital human training, a traditional webpage training without a digital human, or a control group. Musculoskeletal discomfort, knowledge retention, and behavior change were measured. Results: The overall group differences for increased behavior change and knowledge retention were statistically significant ( p 0.05). Conclusion: Digital humans have the potential to meet large-scale remote worker training needs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: In search of a way to bring back the positive aspects of an internship into the curriculum, TU Delft identified serious games as a potential solution. The literature studied showed that games could increase motivation and understanding, leading to improve knowledge retention. This paper has brought these insights together in a framework identifying the benefits that contribute to knowledge retention but also the requirements and risks for the application of serious games to be addressed. These insights were used to explain the success of a longstanding business game course for advanced students first. Next was the development of a virtual reality practice in a first-year course to replace the lost internship. In this case, knowledge retention was improved significantly, albeit only by 5%. Furthermore, in light of the developed framework, the VR simulation is a more balanced approach with fewer risks compared to the more extensive master course.

Abstract: The capitalisation on and transfer of technological, engineering and scientific knowledge associated with empirical know-how is an important issue for the sustainability and development of manufacturing. Indeed, certain sectors of industry are facing the increasing ageing of the labour force, recruitment difficulties and high staff turnover, leading to a loss of knowledge and know-how. In a context of numerical and digital transition and the migration of processes to industry 4.0, one of major challenges manufacturers face today is their capacity to build intelligent platforms for acquiring, storing and transferring their know-how and knowledge. It is crucial to create new media and tools for staff training and development capable of capturing knowledge and reusing it to create a project history through expertise and data collection. This paper presents the methodology and guidelines for implementing electronic knowledge books (eK-Books), along with their uses. The eK-Book is a semantic web-based hypertext medium (channel) allowing stakeholders to capitalise on, structure and transfer knowledge by using concept maps, process maps, influence graphs, downloadable documents, web pages and hypermedia knowledge sheets. They are intended for engineers, expert or novice technicians, manufacturers, sector coordinators and plant managers, as well as trainers and learners. They are usable and manageable in all types of environments and with different levels of accessibility. This paper highlights (1) the transfer knowledge capacity of eK-Books and (2) their usability in two agri-food sectors namely (1) the cheese sector with protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI), and (2) the butchery and cold meat sectors.

Abstract: Objective: To conduct a study to improve diabetes knowledge through a web-based diabetes course in the general adult population. We hypothesised that participation in a web-based diabetes course would have a positive impact on diabetes knowledge retention. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group attended an interactive web-based diabetes course. The Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ24) was used to assess the diabetes knowledge levels. The DKQ24 was completed at the beginning and end of the observation period of 3 months. The experimental group also completed it immediately after the intervention. Results: At the end of the observation period, a statistically significant difference in the mean rank of DKQ24 scores was found in favor of the experimental group ( p < .001). The results of the experimental group had a lower interquartile range (IQR = 3) than those of the control group (IQR = 5). Conclusions: This study suggests that providing a web-based diabetes course to the general population is effective and can improve diabetes knowledge and retention.

Exploring the Dynamics of Technological Decline through the History of a Soviet Computer “Ural” (1955-1990)

Abstract: Literature on technological decline and related concepts is growing. We aim to advance theorizations of the dynamics of technological decline by mobilizing the concept of sociotechnical configuration and a metaphor of its “unraveling.” We take as a case study the declined Soviet computer series Ural . Ural was once among the top three most used computers in the former Soviet Union, but went into decline and got lost even before the dissolution of the country. We find that technological decline is not a trivial process, it is not guaranteed to be gradual but can feature sudden shifts. These shifts can be drops of production and loss of knowledge, as well as efforts to push back. Policy could make use of ongoing processes of decline and try to replicate the effect of the decline of Ural via cessation of access to materials and competences and delegitimation of the technology.

Abstract: Exposing new nurses to theoretical teaching strategies that help them to navigate the ethical challenges in clinical practice is essential for retention and long-term job satisfaction. This article explores the rationale for teaching ethics content in nurse residency programs and ways to navigate ethical decision-making in the clinical setting. Examples of evidence-informed teaching strategies that enhance knowledge retention and reduce the gap between ethical theory and practice are included.Exposing new nurses to theoretical teaching strategies that help them to navigate the ethical challenges in clinical practice is essential for retention and long-term job satisfaction.

Abstract: In 2019, the World Health Assembly declared emergency care essential to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Few sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have developed robust approaches to sustainably deliver emergency medical services (EMS) at scale, as high-income country models are financially impractical. Innovative reassessment of EMS delivery in resource-limited settings is necessary as timely emergency care access can substantially reduce mortality. INTRODUCTION In 2019, the World Health Assembly declared emergency care essential to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Few sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have developed robust approaches to sustainably deliver emergency medical services (EMS) at scale, as high-income country models are financially impractical. Innovative reassessment of EMS delivery in resource-limited settings is necessary as timely emergency care access can substantially reduce mortality.We developed the Lay First Responder (LFR) program by training 1,291 pre-existing motorcycle taxi drivers, a predominant form of short-distance transport in sub-Saharan Africa, to provide trauma care and transport for road traffic injuries. Three pilot programs were launched in staggered fashion between 2016 and 2019 in West, Central, and East Africa and a 5.5 h curriculum was iteratively developed to train first responders. Longitudinal data on patient impact (patient demographics, injury characteristics, and treatment rendered), emergency care knowledge acquisition/retention, and social/financial effects of LFR training were collected and pooled across three sites for collective analysis. Novel cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on prospective cost data from each site. Previously projected aggregate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) addressable by LFRs were used to inform cost-effectiveness ratios($USD cost per DALY averted). Cost-effectiveness ratios were then compared against African per capita gross domestic product (GDP), following WHOCHOICE guidelines, which state ratios less than GDP per capita are "very cost-effective." MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed the Lay First Responder (LFR) program by training 1,291 pre-existing motorcycle taxi drivers, a predominant form of short-distance transport in sub-Saharan Africa, to provide trauma care and transport for road traffic injuries. Three pilot programs were launched in staggered fashion between 2016 and 2019 in West, Central, and East Africa and a 5.5 h curriculum was iteratively developed to train first responders. Longitudinal data on patient impact (patient demographics, injury characteristics, and treatment rendered), emergency care knowledge acquisition/retention, and social/financial effects of LFR training were collected and pooled across three sites for collective analysis.

Previously projected aggregate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) addressable by LFRs were used to inform cost-effectiveness ratios($USD cost per DALY averted). Cost-effectiveness ratios were then compared against African per capita gross domestic product (GDP), following WHOCHOICE guidelines, which state ratios less than GDP per capita are "very cost-effective."In 2,171 total patient encounters across all three pilot sites, LFRs most frequently provided hemorrhage control in 61 % of patient encounters and patient transport by motorcycle in 98.5 %. Median pre-/post-test scores improved by 34.1 percentage points (39.5% vs.73.6 %, p < 0.0001) with significant knowledge retention at six months. 75 % of initial participants remain voluntarily involved 3 years post-course, reporting increased local stature and customer acquisition(income 32.0 % greater than non-trained counterparts). Locally sourced first-aid materials cost $6.54USD/participant. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated cost per DALY averted=$51.65USD. RESULTS In 2,171 total patient encounters across all three pilot sites, LFRs most frequently provided hemorrhage control in 61 % of patient encounters and patient transport by motorcycle in 98.5 %.

Locally sourced first-aid materials cost $6.54USD/participant. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated cost per DALY averted=$51.65USD.LFR training is highly cost-effective according to WHOCHOICE guidelines and expands emergency care access. The LFR program may be an alternative approach to formal ambulance-reliant EMS that are cost-prohibitive in resource-limited, sub-Saharan African settings. A novel social/financial mechanism appears to incentivize long-term voluntary LFR involvement, which may sustain programs in resource-limited settings. CONCLUSION LFR training is highly cost-effective according to WHOCHOICE guidelines and expands emergency care access. The LFR program may be an alternative approach to formal ambulance-reliant EMS that are cost-prohibitive in resource-limited, sub-Saharan African settings. A novel social/financial mechanism appears to incentivize long-term voluntary LFR involvement, which may sustain programs in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: To conduct a study to improve diabetes knowledge through a web-based diabetes course in the general adult population. We hypothesised that participation in a web-based diabetes course would have a positive impact on diabetes knowledge retention. OBJECTIVE To conduct a study to improve diabetes knowledge through a web-based diabetes course in the general adult population. We hypothesised that participation in a web-based diabetes course would have a positive impact on diabetes knowledge retention.Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group attended an interactive web-based diabetes course. The Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ24) was used to assess the diabetes knowledge levels. The DKQ24 was completed at the beginning and end of the observation period of 3 months. The experimental group also completed it immediately after the intervention. METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. Participants in the experimental group attended an interactive web-based diabetes course. The Diabetes Knowledge Questionnaire (DKQ24) was used to assess the diabetes knowledge levels. The DKQ24 was completed at the beginning and end of the observation period of 3 months. The experimental group also completed it immediately after the intervention.At the end of the observation period, a statistically significant difference in the mean rank of DKQ24 scores was found in favor of the experimental group (p < .001). The results of the experimental group had a lower interquartile range (IQR = 3) than those of the control group (IQR = 5). RESULTS At the end of the observation period, a statistically significant difference in the mean rank of DKQ24 scores was found in favor of the experimental group (p < .001). The results of the experimental group had a lower interquartile range (IQR = 3) than those of the control group (IQR = 5).This study suggests that providing a web-based diabetes course to the general population is effective and can improve diabetes knowledge and retention. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that providing a web-based diabetes course to the general population is effective and can improve diabetes knowledge and retention.

Abstract: Medicare Part B (MedB) imposes penalties for certain errors in prescription billing of post-transplant medications, which can greatly affect pharmacy revenue. To prevent MedB billing fines, pharmacy staff must be cognizant of specific MedB requirements. BACKGROUND Medicare Part B (MedB) imposes penalties for certain errors in prescription billing of post-transplant medications, which can greatly affect pharmacy revenue. To prevent MedB billing fines, pharmacy staff must be cognizant of specific MedB requirements.This quality improvement project aimed to retrain certified pharmacy technicians (CPhTs) on common billing errors and evaluate changes in error rates and potential fines after retraining. We aimed to determine whether retraining CPhTs minimizes MedB prescription billing errors and reduces potential fines owed by the Vanderbilt Transplant Pharmacy (VTP) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). OBJECTIVE This quality improvement project aimed to retrain certified pharmacy technicians (CPhTs) on common billing errors and evaluate changes in error rates and potential fines after retraining. We aimed to determine whether retraining CPhTs minimizes MedB prescription billing errors and reduces potential fines owed by the Vanderbilt Transplant Pharmacy (VTP) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).This was a single-center, quality improvement study including post-transplant patients with at least one MedB prescription billing error who filled prescriptions through VTP. All CPhTs involved in MedB prescription billing received retraining focused on the top 3 errors in MedB billing identified at VTP: early refills, missing relationship of caller to patient and residence of patient on order documentation, or no day supply remaining recorded on the order file. Retraining consisted of developing a training checklist, testing current knowledge levels, individualized nonpunitive coaching based on technician specific errors, and retesting for knowledge retention. Outcomes included the number of prescriptions with at least one MedB prescription billing error and the projected amount of dollars fined owing to errors recorded during the 3 months before and 3 months after retraining. METHODS This was a single-center, quality improvement study including post-transplant patients with at least one MedB prescription billing error who filled prescriptions through VTP. All CPhTs involved in MedB prescription billing received retraining focused on the top 3 errors in MedB billing identified at VTP: early refills, missing relationship of caller to patient and residence of patient on order documentation, or no day supply remaining recorded on the order file. Retraining consisted of developing a training checklist, testing current knowledge levels, individualized nonpunitive coaching based on technician specific errors, and retesting for knowledge retention. Outcomes included the number of prescriptions with at least one MedB prescription billing error and the projected amount of dollars fined owing to errors recorded during the 3 months before and 3 months after retraining.Fourteen CPhTs received retraining. Average refill too soon errors decreased by 37.5% (10.7% vs. 6.7%), average missing relationship by 21.7% (7.7% vs. 6%), and day supply errors by 39.7% (1.7% vs. 1%). Error reductions equaled a 28.2% decrease (approximately $12,700) in potential fines. RESULTS Fourteen CPhTs received retraining. Average refill too soon errors decreased by 37.5% (10.7% vs. 6.7%), average missing relationship by 21.7% (7.7% vs. 6%), and day supply errors by 39.7% (1.7% vs. 1%). Error reductions equaled a 28.2% decrease (approximately $12,700) in potential fines.Retraining focused on MedB billing error successfully reduced error frequency and fines from CMS. MedB billing error fines can be costly for pharmacies dispensing high-cost medications; therefore, identifying common errors and training staff can be useful and financially prudent. CONCLUSION Retraining focused on MedB billing error successfully reduced error frequency and fines from CMS. MedB billing error fines can be costly for pharmacies dispensing high-cost medications; therefore, identifying common errors and training staff can be useful and financially prudent.

Abstract: Although game-based applications have been used in disaster medicine education, no serious computer games have been designed specifically for training these nurses in an IEMT setting. To address this need, we developed a serious computer game called the IEMTtraining game. In this game, players assume the roles of IEMT nurses, assess patient injuries in a virtual environment, and provide suitable treatment options. BACKGROUND Although game-based applications have been used in disaster medicine education, no serious computer games have been designed specifically for training these nurses in an IEMT setting. To address this need, we developed a serious computer game called the IEMTtraining game. In this game, players assume the roles of IEMT nurses, assess patient injuries in a virtual environment, and provide suitable treatment options.The design of this study is a retrospective comparative analysis. The research was conducted with 209 nurses in a hospital. The data collection process of this study was conducted at the 2019-2020 academic year. A retrospective comparative analysis was conducted on the pre-, post-, and final test scores of nurses in the IEMT. Additionally, a survey questionnaire was distributed to trainees to gather insights into teaching methods that were subsequently analyzed. METHODS The design of this study is a retrospective comparative analysis. The research was conducted with 209 nurses in a hospital. The data collection process of this study was conducted at the 2019-2020 academic year. A retrospective comparative analysis was conducted on the pre-, post-, and final test scores of nurses in the IEMT. Additionally, a survey questionnaire was distributed to trainees to gather insights into teaching methods that were subsequently analyzed.There was a significant difference in the overall test scores between the two groups, with the game group demonstrating superior performance compared to the control group (odds ratio = 1.363, p value = 0.010). The survey results indicated that the game group exhibited higher learning motivation scores and lower cognitive load compared with the lecture group. RESULTS There was a significant difference in the overall test scores between the two groups, with the game group demonstrating superior performance compared to the control group (odds ratio = 1.363, p value = 0.010). The survey results indicated that the game group exhibited higher learning motivation scores and lower cognitive load compared with the lecture group.The IEMT training game developed by the instructor team is a promising and effective method for training nurses in disaster rescue within IEMTs. The game equips the trainees with the necessary skills and knowledge to respond effectively to emergencies. It is easily comprehended, enhances knowledge retention and motivation to learn, and reduces cognitive load. CONCLUSIONS The IEMT training game developed by the instructor team is a promising and effective method for training nurses in disaster rescue within IEMTs. The game equips the trainees with the necessary skills and knowledge to respond effectively to emergencies. It is easily comprehended, enhances knowledge retention and motivation to learn, and reduces cognitive load.

Score race”: A perspective of Cai Nuoc high school students

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/score-race-perspective-cai-nuoc-high-school/docview/3043399728/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The scoring race is a phenomenon where students participate in learning just for the sake of their scores; Schools, families, and society only judge students by their grades. The study was carried out to assess the status of the scoring race and propose some solutions to reduce the negative influence of this phenomenon. Cai Nuoc High School, Ca Mau Province - the most remote area in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam was selected for the case study. A cross-sectional survey model combined with quantitative research was used in this study. The number of students answering the question was 245, and the questionnaire was designed through Google Form in November 2021. The research results show that the majority of students participated in the scoring race (3.47±1.29), most of the students liked to get high scores (3.46±1.42) and were disappointed due to the loss of knowledge (4.16±0.98) and careless (4.82±0.61). Besides, the majority of students think that society judges them only by their scores (4.37±0.96); they are under a lot of pressure because of their grades (3.76±1.20), pressure from teachers (3.39±0.92, accounting for 82.1%), students have ever violated the test because of scores (4.10±1.24), had conflicts with classmates because of scores (3.36±1.34). Thus, in order to lessen the “score race” adverse effect, first of all, schools need to innovate teaching content, diversify teaching methods, teaching techniques, and methods of assessing results learning outcomes; families and society need to change their perception of students abilities; Students need to orient their learning goals, develop a study plan, actively participate in all learning activities to develop the necessary qualities and competencies.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of short virtual reality (VR) exercises on knowledge retention for adult learners at a contractor safety training organisation supporting the energy industry who took computer-based training (CBT) courses. The intent was to simulate a delay period similar to that experienced by contractors who support work in the energy industry to determine if traditional CBT can be made more effective for stimulating greater transfer of learning with the addition of VR exercises. The experimental group was exposed to CBTs augmented by VR exercises that reinforced the CBT course learning objectives. The control group for this research took the same CBT course without short VR exercises. A quantitative analysis was performed on data collected from a course exam provided immediately after the course delivery and from a separate follow-up quiz delivered 3 days after the course(s) completion. Data from these testing instruments were analysed to determine the participant’s likelihood of remembering content from the CBT courses and if there was greater knowledge retention of the course learning objectives and procedures within the experimental group than within the control group. The results found a non-statistically significant relationship between the two groups; however, trends between the groups show that there are benefits for transfer of learning when using short VR exercises compared to those groups without short VR exercises.

Abstract: Postgraduate medical education often relies on the traditional lecture model with low knowledge retention rates of 5-20%. Cognitive overload from excessive information during lectures diminishes learning efficacy. To optimise learning, evidence suggests prioritising active engagement, streamlining visual aids, introducing clinical scenarios, and incorporating audience response systems may further enhance retention and comprehension. In conclusion, the traditional lecture must evolve into more interactive and engaging modalities to facilitate increased participant long-term learning as summarised in this review.Postgraduate medical education often relies on the traditional lecture model with low knowledge retention rates of 5-20%.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Background: Dalmatian Zagora has experienced significant depopulation trends over recent decades. The area is very interesting because of its rich biodiversity of species as well as its history of the use of wild foods. Since there is a danger of permanent loss of knowledge on the use of wild edibles, we focused our research on recording traditions local to this area. Methods: We conducted interviews with 180 residents. Results: A record was made of 136 species of wild food plants and 22 species of edible mushrooms gathered in the area. The most frequently collected species are Rubus ulmifolius Schott, Cornus mas L., Portulaca oleracea L., Asparagus acutifolius L., Sonchus spp., Morus spp., Taraxacum spp., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Cichorium intybus L., and Dioscorea communis (L.) Caddick & Wilkin. Conclusions: The list of taxa used is typical for other (sub-)Mediterranean parts of Croatia; however, more fungi species are used. The most important finding of the paper is probably the recording of Legousia speculum-veneris (L.) Chaix, a wild vegetable used in the area.

Abstract: Background: Retention of adult basic life support (BLS) knowledge and skills after professional training declines over time. To combat this, the European Resuscitation Council and the American Heart Association recommend shorter, more frequent BLS sessions. Emphasizing technology-enhanced learning, such as mobile learning, aims to increase out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival and is becoming more integral in nursing education. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether playing a serious smartphone game called MOBICPR at home can improve and retain nursing students’ theoretical knowledge of and practical skills in adult BLS. Methods: This study used a randomized wait list–controlled design. Nursing students were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a MOBICPR intervention group (MOBICPR-IG) or a wait-list control group (WL-CG), where the latter received the MOBICPR game 2 weeks after the MOBICPR-IG. The aim of the MOBICPR game is to engage participants in using smartphone gestures (eg, tapping) and actions (eg, talking) to perform evidence-based adult BLS on a virtual patient with OHCA. The participants’ theoretical knowledge of adult BLS was assessed using a questionnaire, while their practical skills were evaluated on cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality parameters using a manikin and a checklist. Results: In total, 43 nursing students participated in the study, 22 (51%) in MOBICPR-IG and 21 (49%) in WL-CG. There were differences between the MOBICPR-IG and the WL-CG in theoretical knowledge ( P = .04) but not in practical skills ( P = .45) after MOBICPR game playing at home. No difference was noted in the retention of participants’ theoretical knowledge and practical skills of adult BLS after a 2-week break from playing the MOBICPR game ( P = .13). Key observations included challenges in response checks with a face-down manikin and a general neglect of safety protocols when using an automated external defibrillator. Conclusions: Playing the MOBICPR game at home has the greatest impact on improving the theoretical knowledge of adult BLS in nursing students but not their practical skills. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse scenarios into adult BLS training. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: This study aimed to assess the impact of continuous precision nursing on neurobehavioral function and pregnancy outcomes in patients experiencing threatened abortion. A total of 130 patients with early threatened abortion admitted to our hospital between October 2020 and January 2023 were selected and categorized into 2 groups based on intervention methods. The control group received routine nursing intervention, whereas the observation group received continuous precision nursing intervention. Changes in affective status scores, SF-36 scores, knowledge mastery scores, and satisfaction scores in the neurobehavioral function test before and after intervention were recorded in both groups. Additionally, pregnancy outcomes, obstetric adverse reaction rates, and neonatal conditions were documented. Following intervention, scores for tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment gradually decreased in both groups, with significantly lower scores observed in the observation group compared to the control group (P   .05). Continuous precision nursing contributes to improved pregnancy outcomes for patients with threatened miscarriage within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. This comprehensive care approach is associated with enhanced knowledge retention, protection of neurological function, and an overall improvement in quality of life.This study aimed to assess the impact of continuous precision nursing on neurobehavioral function and pregnancy outcomes in patients experiencing threatened abortion.

Abstract: Background: Adolescence, 10-19 years is a vulnerable age where eating behaviours are inculcated. Adult health and size are determined by the adolescents dietary habits. The poor health & diet choices by adolescents is a result of lack of knowledge about Glycemic Index, Trans Fats, etc. Thus, educating them at this mouldable age is important. Objectives: 1) To study the knowledge and its retention among adolescents of 8th-12th standard after interactive education about food habits and lifestyle changes. 2) To identify the prevalence of overweight and obesity among high school students in various private and government schools. Methodology: An intervention study was conducted in 441 adolescents of 8th- 12th standard in government and private schools. In first interaction BMI and questionnaire on awareness, perception and practise on diet was filled by participants and educational material on same was shared and their knowledge retention was assessed after 2 months and the results were compared between government and private schools. Results: In terms of age, the majority of subjects fall into the 14-year-old category (37.3%), and 15-year-old (33.2%). In terms of class, the largest proportion is in 9th and 10th class (36.4%). Gender distribution shows majority of females (57.5%). Father’s educational status reveals a significant percentage of graduates (48.4%), while mothers have a high school education (59.3%). Majority follow a non-vegetarian diet (64.3%) and reside in urban areas (54.8%). Lastly, the distribution of BMI categories indicates that a significant portion falls within the normal range (48.2%), with rest as overweight (30.2%), obese (20.7%), and underweight (0.9%). Mean scores of pre and post intervention were compared and statistically significant difference (p=<0.001) was noted. Conclusion: Adolescents are at higher risk of overweight and obesity. Nutritional education reinforcement in this period has significant impact on reduction of Non-Communicable Diseases. Knowledge intervention in this study had similar result.

Abstract: This paper describes the co-design and development process of an evidence-informed e -training program (Sit-Stand e -Guide) to support the safe and optimal use of sit-stand workstations from ergonomics and behavioural change perspectives. Using an instructional system design process, supported by a participatory design approach, data was collected through three workshops with workplace consumers (staff [n = 5] and managers [n = 5]), and subject matter experts (n = 5). Content and learning activities were developed based on behaviour change principles and optimal pedagogy. Key topics identified for the e -training were sedentary behaviour and health; workstation set-up; and strategies for behaviour change. Learning activities (scenarios and reflection) to enhance knowledge retention and skills implementation and an interactive one-page guide on completion were included in the e -training. The relevance and usefulness of the training prototype were reviewed through one-to-one think-aloud sessions with the workshop consumers (n = 5) and external health and safety professionals (n = 5) receiving positive feedback. The Sit-Stand e -Guide is readily available for workplace implementation and evaluation. This paper serves as a practical guide for future training development.

Markets and Metis: Reading Hayek with Scott

Author: Reamer, Robert11 King's College London

Abstract: Both James C. Scott and Friedrich Hayek articulate critiques of centralised state planning that are fundamentally epistemological in character. In particular, both emphasize the loss of knowledge resulting from attempts to achieve synoptic legibility of complex social practices. Yet while Hayek's critique of central planning leads to an emphasis on the indispensability of the price system, Scott argues that capitalist markets are also mechanisms of perverse simplification. This paper explores the roots of this disagreement and seeks to articulate the insights that emerge from reading Hayek and Scott together on questions of markets, knowledge, and the state.

Abstract: Neuroanatomy education benefits from cadaveric specimens, yet challenges with access, cost, and health concerns exist. Virtual Dissection Tables (VDTs) offer digital alternatives to traditional cadaveric learning. This article evaluates the pedagogical value of VDTs in undergraduate neuroanatomy education. While VDTs, primarily Anatomage, offer interactive 3D cadaveric images and customization options, research on their impact on neuroanatomy learning outcomes remain limited. Existing studies suggest comparable knowledge retention between VDTs and cadaveric learning, with varying effects on student satisfaction. Investigations of non-exam-based neuroanatomy assessments, however, are scarce. This study presents a case study using VDTs as the basis for a neuroscience assignment report, exploring its construction, and evaluating its strengths, and weaknesses through a student survey. Implemented in an advanced neuroscience course, the assignment involves analyzing 3D reconstructed MRI scans of neuropathological conditions displayed on the VDT. The task requires students to collate, analyze, and predict symptoms based on the pathology observed, aligning their findings with neuroscience literature. This innovative approach aims to enhance research and academic writing skills while expanding the use of VDTs beyond traditional assessment formats in neuroscience education. We found that the case-study format benefited students' neuroanatomy learning and application ability. Further studies should be conducted, however, to understand the effect of VDT use on learning outcomes in case study contexts.Neuroanatomy education benefits from cadaveric specimens, yet challenges with access, cost, and health concerns exist.

Abstract: Background: Adolescence, 10-19 years is a vulnerable age where eating behaviours are inculcated. Adult health and size are determined by the adolescents dietary habits. The poor health & diet choices by adolescents is a result of lack of knowledge about Glycemic Index, Trans Fats, etc. Thus, educating them at this mouldable age is important. Objectives: 1) To study the knowledge and its retention among adolescents of 8th-12th standard after interactive education about food habits and lifestyle changes. 2) To identify the prevalence of overweight and obesity among high school students in various private and government schools. Methodology: An intervention study was conducted in 441 adolescents of 8th- 12th standard in government and private schools. In first interaction BMI and questionnaire on awareness, perception and practise on diet was filled by participants and educational material on same was shared and their knowledge retention was assessed after 2 months and the results were compared between government and private schools. Results: In terms of age, the majority of subjects fall into the 14-year-old category (37.3%), and 15-year-old (33.2%). In terms of class, the largest proportion is in 9th and 10th class (36.4%). Gender distribution shows majority of females (57.5%). Father’s educational status reveals a significant percentage of graduates (48.4%), while mothers have a high school education (59.3%). Majority follow a non-vegetarian diet (64.3%) and reside in urban areas (54.8%). Lastly, the distribution of BMI categories indicates that a significant portion falls within the normal range (48.2%), with rest as overweight (30.2%), obese (20.7%), and underweight (0.9%). Mean scores of pre and post intervention were compared and statistically significant difference (p=<0.001) was noted. Conclusion: Adolescents are at higher risk of overweight and obesity. Nutritional education reinforcement in this period has significant impact on reduction of Non-Communicable Diseases. Knowledge intervention in this study had similar result.

Abstract: Gamification, which involves incorporating game-like elements in non-game contexts, has quickly become one of the most popular persuasive technologies. Its goal is to encourage users to change their behavior for the better. However, it still has empirical and theoretical challenges to overcome to show the benefits of its use and solidify the guiding principles for effective gamification designs. The goal of the current study is to synthesize and intellectualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the current state of gamification knowledge in human resource management, providing a road map for future research recommendations for both academician and practitioners The review examines the most influential writing on the application of gamification to association settings, portrays the fundamental concepts of gamification, and develops based on an effective writing survey of insightful articles available in the Scopus and Web of Science information bases. The study uses a systematic quantitative approach to review the evidence for the use of gamification in Human Resources management, focusing on the pertinent literature on gamification in organizations. The authors examined 244 papers published between 2013 and 2022 using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) technique. One of the major goals of the study’s findings is to illustrate the value of gamification in the human resources field in relation to the analysis of employee performance, employee engagement, and training and development. These results suggest that there is more opportunity for research into the elements of gamification, which may be relate to knowledge retention, learning outcomes, learning motivation, employee efficacy, and employee productivity. Alternate abstract: Plain Language Summary Purpose- The present study’s goal is to amalgamate and intellectualize, through a systematic literature review (SLR), the modern state of gamification knowledge in Human Resource Management Management, providing a roadmap for future research recommendations for service research and practice. Methods- The research is based on a systematic literature review. It implements a systematic quantitative approach to review existing evidence on gamification usage in employee management, focusing on relevant literature on gamification in organizations. The authors analyzed 108 papers published between 2013 and 2022. Conclusion- The study’s findings is to illustrate the value of gamification in the human resources field in the analysis of employee performance, employee engagement, and training and development. These results suggest that there is more opportunity for research into gamification elements, which may relate to knowledge retention, learning outcomes, learning motivation, employee efficacy, and employee productivity. Limitations of study- several pilot searches in the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were conducted before obtaining the final dataset. Besides Science Direct, PubMed, Academia, and Google Scholars could have used other databases for this research. Since it is the most widely used product, uses rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria that are transparent and consistent, is publisher independent, and is a multidisciplinary global citation database, the author built the dataset from WoS and Scopus. Because of the limitations of using only two databases, we could not include in our dataset any high-caliber relevant works that weren’t indexed by WoS and Scopus.

Abstract: Introduction and Objectives Patient-centred (PC) and holistic care improves patient satisfaction and health outcomes. We sought to investigate the benefit of utilising a PC pathology report in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer (PCa). Our study aimed to evaluate and compare patient understanding of their PCa diagnosis after RP, upon receiving either a standard histopathology report or a personalised and PC report (PCR). Moreover, we evaluated knowledge retention at 4 weeks after the initial consultation. Methods We invited patients undergoing RP at three metropolitan Urology clinics to participate in our randomised controlled study. Patients were randomised to receive either a PCR or standard pathology report. Patient satisfaction questionnaires (Perceived Efficacy in Patient–Physician Interactions [PEPPI], Consultation and Relational Empathy [CARE] and Communication Assessment Tool [CAT]) and a knowledge test were conducted within 72 h of the initial appointment and again at 4 weeks. Accurate recollection of Gleason grade group (GGG) and extracapsular extension (ECE) were classified as ‘correct’. Baseline demographic data included age, education, marital and employment status, pre-op prostate specific antigen (PSA) and clinical stage. Baseline data were tested for differences between groups using the Student's t test, chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test depending on whether data were continuous, categorical or sparse. Comparison of correctly answered ‘knowledge’ questions was analysed using chi-squared test. A significance level of p  ≤ 0.05 was used. Results Data from 62 patients were analysed (30 standard vs. 32 PCR). No significant differences in baseline demographics were found between groups. Both groups reported high levels of satisfaction with their healthcare experiences in all domains of patient–physician rapport, empathy and communication. There were no significant differences between groups in PEPPI ( p  = 0.68), CAT ( p  = 0.39) and CARE ( p  = 0.66) scores, at baseline and 4 weeks. Ninety-three per cent of patients who received the PCR understood the report while 90% felt the report added to their understanding of their PCa. Regarding patient knowledge, the PCR group had significantly more correct answers on GGG and ECE as compared with the standard report group at baseline and 4 weeks ( p  < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that PC pathology reports improve patient knowledge and understanding of their PCa that is retained for at least 4 weeks after initial receipt of results.

Abstract: In the dynamic volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous (VUCA) landscape, industries like metals and mining face a pressing challenge of skill scarcity due to the struggle to keep up with technological advancements. To revitalize their workforce and appeal to younger generations, integrating gamification into learning and development approaches holds immense potential. Employee motivation and knowledge retention can be elevated by infusing game mechanics such as badges, points, and leaderboards. Gamification fosters engagement, teamwork, and innovation through interactive experiences. This approach can effectively address the skill shortage by enhancing the industry's attractiveness and competitiveness. The paper aims to investigate the skill deficit in the metals and mining sector and explore how gamified learning methods can effectively alleviate this challenge, ultimately aiding in talent acquisition and retention. The study used purposive sampling, and data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with primary stakeholders of learning and development functions. Further, the qualitative data was subjected to thematic analysis using NVivo software. Two significant themes, from eight sub-themes that emerged from thirty codes, were identified. The first theme was issues with the young generation, and the second was the benefits of gamification in learning and development. The study suggests the need for and advantage of gamification in human resource management's learning and development function.

Abstract: High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with improved patient outcomes, but healthcare workers (HCWs) may be frequently undertrained. This study aimed to assess baseline knowledge and skills among HCWs about basic and advanced life support and the effect of simulation-based training on it. Aim and background High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is associated with improved patient outcomes, but healthcare workers (HCWs) may be frequently undertrained. This study aimed to assess baseline knowledge and skills among HCWs about basic and advanced life support and the effect of simulation-based training on it.It was a single-center prospective quasi-interventional study among resident doctors and nurses at a Tertiary Center in New Delhi, India. A questionnaire-based assessment was done to assess baseline knowledge. The participants then underwent simulation-based training followed by questionnaire-based knowledge assessment and skill assessment. A repeat questionnaire-based assessment was done 6 months post-training to assess knowledge retention. Methods It was a single-center prospective quasi-interventional study among resident doctors and nurses at a Tertiary Center in New Delhi, India. A questionnaire-based assessment was done to assess baseline knowledge. The participants then underwent simulation-based training followed by questionnaire-based knowledge assessment and skill assessment. A repeat questionnaire-based assessment was done 6 months post-training to assess knowledge retention.A total of 82 HCWs (54 doctors and 28 nurses) were enrolled. The participants scored 22.28 ± 6.06 out of 35 (63.65%) in the pre-training knowledge assessment, with low scores in post-cardiac arrest care, advanced life support, and defibrillation. After the training, there was a significant rise in scores to 28.32 ± 4.08 out of 35 (80.9%) ( p < 0.01). The retention of knowledge at 6 months was 68.87% ( p < 0.01). The participants scored 92.61 ± 4.75% marks in skill assessment with lower scores in chest compressions and team leadership roles. There was a positive correlation ( r = 0.35) between knowledge and skills scores ( p < 0.01). Results A total of 82 HCWs (54 doctors and 28 nurses) were enrolled. The participants scored 22.28 ± 6.06 out of 35 (63.65%) in the pre-training knowledge assessment, with low scores in post-cardiac arrest care, advanced life support, and defibrillation. After the training, there was a significant rise in scores to 28.32 ± 4.08 out of 35 (80.9%) (p < 0.01). The retention of knowledge at 6 months was 68.87% (p < 0.01). The participants scored 92.61 ± 4.75% marks in skill assessment with lower scores in chest compressions and team leadership roles. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.35) between knowledge and skills scores (p < 0.01).There is a progressive decrease in baseline knowledge of HCWs with the further steps in the adult chain of survival. The simulation training program had a positive impact on the knowledge of HCWs. The training programs should focus on defibrillation, advanced life support, post-cardiac arrest care, and leadership roles. Conclusion There is a progressive decrease in baseline knowledge of HCWs with the further steps in the adult chain of survival. The simulation training program had a positive impact on the knowledge of HCWs. The training programs should focus on defibrillation, advanced life support, post-cardiac arrest care, and leadership roles.Agarwal A, Baitha U, Ranjan P, Swarnkar NK, Singh GP, Baidya DK, et al .

Abstract: Achievement of evidence-informed decision making (EIDM) requires the integration of evidence into all practice decisions by identifying and synthesizing evidence, then developing and executing plans to implement and evaluate changes to practice. This rapid systematic review synthesizes evidence for strategies for the implementation of EIDM across organizations, mapping facilitators and barriers to the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation, behaviour) model for behaviour change. The review was conducted to support leadership at organizations delivering public health services (health promotion, communicable disease prevention) to drive change toward evidence-informed public health. BACKGROUND Achievement of evidence-informed decision making (EIDM) requires the integration of evidence into all practice decisions by identifying and synthesizing evidence, then developing and executing plans to implement and evaluate changes to practice. This rapid systematic review synthesizes evidence for strategies for the implementation of EIDM across organizations, mapping facilitators and barriers to the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation, behaviour) model for behaviour change. The review was conducted to support leadership at organizations delivering public health services (health promotion, communicable disease prevention) to drive change toward evidence-informed public health.A systematic search was conducted in multiple databases and by reviewing publications of key authors. Articles that describe interventions to drive EIDM within teams, departments, or organizations were eligible for inclusion. For each included article, quality was assessed, and details of the intervention, setting, outcomes, facilitators and barriers were extracted. A convergent integrated approach was undertaken to analyze both quantitative and qualitative findings. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in multiple databases and by reviewing publications of key authors. Articles that describe interventions to drive EIDM within teams, departments, or organizations were eligible for inclusion. For each included article, quality was assessed, and details of the intervention, setting, outcomes, facilitators and barriers were extracted. A convergent integrated approach was undertaken to analyze both quantitative and qualitative findings.Thirty-seven articles are included. Studies were conducted in primary care, public health, social services, and occupational health settings. Strategies to implement EIDM included the establishment of Knowledge Broker-type roles, building the EIDM capacity of staff, and research or academic partnerships. Facilitators and barriers align with the COM-B model for behaviour change. Facilitators for capability include the development of staff knowledge and skill, establishing specialized roles, and knowledge sharing across the organization, though staff turnover and subsequent knowledge loss was a barrier to capability. For opportunity, facilitators include the development of processes or mechanisms to support new practices, forums for learning and skill development, and protected time, and barriers include competing priorities. Facilitators identified for motivation include supportive organizational culture, expectations for new practices to occur, recognition and positive reinforcement, and strong leadership support. Barriers include negative attitudes toward new practices, and lack of understanding and support from management. RESULTS Thirty-seven articles are included.

Abstract: We evaluate a pedagogical intervention aimed at improving learning in elementary school children by fostering their curiosity. We test the effectiveness of the pedagogy using achievement scores and a novel measure of curiosity. The latter involves creating a sense of information deprivation and quantifying the urge to acquire information and retention ability. The intervention increases curiosity, knowledge retention, and science test scores, with the effects persisting into middle school years. It also leads to more information sharing and peer learning in the classroom. The evidence can help design better pedagogical tools to increase pupil engagement and the quality of learning.

Abstract: Background Education is, after gaming, the second largest sector embracing augmented reality (AR) at an accelerated pace, yet studies on AR's potential as an efficient learning environment had mixed results. Objectives This study's primary objective is to test students' interaction with graphical 3D elements in AR and its impact on information retention. The second objective is to compare information retention from AR engagement with information retention from exposure to identical 3D content delivered via instructional video. Finally, the third objective explores students' perceptions of AR as a learning environment. Methods Sixty‐five college students participated in a two‐arm experiment followed by semi‐structured interviews. Results and Conclusion AR can efficiently deliver a meaningful learning experience and promotes information retention. Nevertheless, AR's interactive features and novelty may distract learners while they engage with the virtual environment. Objective data obtained through eye tracking and video monitoring showed similar levels of engagement with a 3D model for both environments. While both AR and video groups showed significant knowledge gain from pre to post‐intervention, the video format was overall significantly more effective than AR in increasing topic‐related information retention. However, participants preferred the AR learning environment significantly more than the video. Takeaways Although effective, AR is still a distracting instructional environment. Designing learning experiences tailored explicitly for AR environments requires additional research to ensure its successful deployment as a learning tool. Alternate abstract: Lay Description What is already known about this topic Education is the second‐fastest growing sector to adopt and experiment with augmented reality (AR). Hardware and software tools to create AR environments have reached the consumer level. The advantage of immersing learners in dedicated virtual environments seems obvious. Research has had mixed results in validating AR as a proper learning environment. What this paper adds AR is a viable environment which supports information retention. For many students, the medium's novelty promotes engagement with the content. Students prefer AR to video lectures, but it may distract them from learning. Regarding information retention, video lectures do better than AR. The implications of study findings for practitioners Learning experiences in AR should be reserved for some specific topics and designed purposedly. Progressive exposure of learners to AR environments may produce habituation and decrease distraction.

Abstract: We identify factors associated with sustainment of an intervention (STAR-VA) to address distress behaviors in dementia (DBD), guided by the Organizational Memory Knowledge Reservoir (KR) framework, compared across 2 types of outcomes: (1) site performance improvement on a clinical outcome, the magnitude of change in levels of DBD, and (2) self-rated adherence to STAR-VA core components, a process outcome. OBJECTIVES We identify factors associated with sustainment of an intervention (STAR-VA) to address distress behaviors in dementia (DBD), guided by the Organizational Memory Knowledge Reservoir (KR) framework, compared across 2 types of outcomes: (1) site performance improvement on a clinical outcome, the magnitude of change in levels of DBD, and (2) self-rated adherence to STAR-VA core components, a process outcome.We used a cross-sectional sequential explanatory mixed methods design guided by the Organizational Memory Framework. DESIGN We used a cross-sectional sequential explanatory mixed methods design guided by the Organizational Memory Framework.We selected 20 of 79 sites that completed STAR-VA training and consultation based on rankings on 2 outcomes-change in an indicator of DBD and reported adherence to STAR-VA core components. We recruited key informants most knowledgeable about STAR-VA resulting in a sample of 43% behavioral coordinators, 36% nurse champions, and 21% nurse leaders. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We selected 20 of 79 sites that completed STAR-VA training and consultation based on rankings on 2 outcomes-change in an indicator of DBD and reported adherence to STAR-VA core components. We recruited key informants most knowledgeable about STAR-VA resulting in a sample of 43% behavioral coordinators, 36% nurse champions, and 21% nurse leaders.We collected data with key informants at each Community Living Center (CLC) from December 2018 to June 2019. We analyzed data using within-case and cross-case matrixes created from the coded transcripts for each a priori KR domain. We then assessed if there were any similarities or differences for CLCs in comparable DBD performance and STAR-VA adherence categories. METHODS We collected data with key informants at each Community Living Center (CLC) from December 2018 to June 2019. We analyzed data using within-case and cross-case matrixes created from the coded transcripts for each a priori KR domain. We then assessed if there were any similarities or differences for CLCs in comparable DBD performance and STAR-VA adherence categories.We found 4 KRs that differentiated sustainment factors based on CLC implementation process and clinical outcomes-3 KRs related to DBD performance (people, relationships, and routines) and 2 related to STAR-VA adherence (relationships and culture). RESULTS We found 4 KRs that differentiated sustainment factors based on CLC implementation process and clinical outcomes-3 KRs related to DBD performance (people, relationships, and routines) and 2 related to STAR-VA adherence (relationships and culture).This evaluation found several knowledge retention mechanisms that differ in high and low performance/adherence sites. Our findings highlight knowledge retention/sustainment strategies based on site functioning to support sustainment strategies in the CLC. Understanding sustainment factors as they relate to clinical and process outcomes is innovative and can be used to support CLCs struggling with sustainment. More research is needed to inform tailored sustainment efforts based on site functioning in the nursing home setting. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This evaluation found several knowledge retention mechanisms that differ in high and low performance/adherence sites. Our findings highlight knowledge retention/sustainment strategies based on site functioning to support sustainment strategies in the CLC. Understanding sustainment factors as they relate to clinical and process outcomes is innovative and can be used to support CLCs struggling with sustainment.

Abstract: This paper describes the co-design and development process of an evidence-informed e-training program (Sit-Stand e-Guide) to support the safe and optimal use of sit-stand workstations from ergonomics and behavioural change perspectives. Using an instructional system design process, supported by a participatory design approach, data was collected through three workshops with workplace consumers (staff [n = 5] and managers [n = 5]), and subject matter experts (n = 5). Content and learning activities were developed based on behaviour change principles and optimal pedagogy. Key topics identified for the e-training were sedentary behaviour and health; workstation set-up; and strategies for behaviour change. Learning activities (scenarios and reflection) to enhance knowledge retention and skills implementation and an interactive one-page guide on completion were included in the e-training. The relevance and usefulness of the training prototype were reviewed through one-to-one think-aloud sessions with the workshop consumers (n = 5) and external health and safety professionals (n = 5) receiving positive feedback. The Sit-Stand e-Guide is readily available for workplace implementation and evaluation. This paper serves as a practical guide for future training development.This paper describes the co-design and development process of an evidence-informed e-training program (Sit-Stand e-Guide) to support the safe and optimal use of sit-stand workstations from ergonomics and behavioural change perspectives.

Abstract: Background: Education is, after gaming, the second largest sector embracing augmented reality (AR) at an accelerated pace, yet studies on AR's potential as an efficient learning environment had mixed results. Objectives: This study's primary objective is to test students' interaction with graphical 3D elements in AR and its impact on information retention. The second objective is to compare information retention from AR engagement with information retention from exposure to identical 3D content delivered via instructional video. Finally, the third objective explores students' perceptions of AR as a learning environment. Methods: Sixty-five college students participated in a two-arm experiment followed by semi-structured interviews. Results and Conclusion: AR can efficiently deliver a meaningful learning experience and promotes information retention. Nevertheless, AR's interactive features and novelty may distract learners while they engage with the virtual environment. Objective data obtained through eye tracking and video monitoring showed similar levels of engagement with a 3D model for both environments. While both AR and video groups showed significant knowledge gain from pre to post-intervention, the video format was overall significantly more effective than AR in increasing topic-related information retention. However, participants preferred the AR learning environment significantly more than the video. Takeaways: Although effective, AR is still a distracting instructional environment. Designing learning experiences tailored explicitly for AR environments requires additional research to ensure its successful deployment as a learning tool.

Abstract: Two variants of semantic dementia are recognized based on the laterality of temporal lobe involvement: a left-predominant variant associated with verbal knowledge impairment and a right-predominant variant associated with behavioural changes and non-verbal knowledge loss. This cross-sectional clinicoradiologic study aimed to assess whole hippocampal, subregion, and/or subfield volume loss in semantic dementia versus controls and across its variants. Thirty-five semantic dementia participants and 15 controls from the Neurodegenerative Research Group at Mayo Clinic who had completed 3.0-T volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography were included. Classification as left-predominant ( n = 25) or right-predominant ( n = 10) variant was based on temporal lobe hypometabolism. Volumes of hippocampal subregions (head, body, and tail) and subfields (parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, cornu ammonis 1, cornu ammonis 3, cornu ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, molecular layer, hippocampal–amygdaloid transition area, and fimbria) were obtained using FreeSurfer 7. Subfield volumes were measured separately from head and body subregions. We fit linear mixed-effects models using log-transformed whole hippocampal/subregion/subfield volumes as dependent variables; age, sex, total intracranial volume, hemisphere and a group-by-hemisphere interaction as fixed effects; and subregion/subfield nested within hemisphere as a random effect. Significant results ( P < 0.05) are hereby reported. At the whole hippocampal level, the dominant (predominantly involved) hemisphere of both variants showed 23–27% smaller volumes than controls. The non-dominant (less involved) hemisphere of the right-predominant variant also showed volume loss versus controls and the left-predominant variant. At the subregional level, both variants showed 17–28% smaller dominant hemisphere head, body, and tail than controls, with the right-predominant variant also showing 8–12% smaller non-dominant hemisphere head than controls and left-predominant variant. At the subfield level, the left-predominant variant showed 12–36% smaller volumes across all dominant hemisphere subfields and 14–15% smaller non-dominant hemisphere parasubiculum, presubiculum (head and body), subiculum (head) and hippocampal–amygdaloid transition area than controls. The right-predominant variant showed 16–49% smaller volumes across all dominant hemisphere subfields and 14–22% smaller parasubiculum, presubiculum, subiculum, cornu ammonis 3, hippocampal–amygdaloid transition area (all from the head) and fimbria of non-dominant hemisphere versus controls. Comparison of dominant hemispheres showed 16–29% smaller volumes of the parasubiculum, presubiculum (head) and fimbria in the right-predominant than left-predominant variant; comparison of non-dominant hemispheres showed 12–15% smaller cornu ammonis 3, cornu ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, hippocampal–amygdaloid transition area (all from the head) and cornu ammonis 1, cornu ammonis 3 and cornu ammonis 4 (all from the body) in the right-predominant variant. All hippocampal subregion/subfield volumes are affected in semantic dementia, although some are more affected in both dominant and non-dominant hemispheres of the right-predominant than the left-predominant variant by the time of presentation. Involvement of hippocampal structures is apparently more subregion dependent than subfield dependent, indicating possible superiority of subregion volumes as disease biomarkers.

Abstract: Poor learning and retention are common problems of students, which may be alleviated by optimization of widely used educational methods such as lectures. This study aimed to investigate the effect of spaced learning on the learning outcome and retention of nurse anesthesia students. BACKGROUND Poor learning and retention are common problems of students, which may be alleviated by optimization of widely used educational methods such as lectures. This study aimed to investigate the effect of spaced learning on the learning outcome and retention of nurse anesthesia students.This was a randomized controlled study with a pre-and post-test design on 64 nurse anesthesia students who were divided into two groups of spaced lecture (n = 32) and conventional lecture (n = 32). The spaced lectures included three 30-minute training sessions with 10-minute intervals while the conventional sessions including 90 min of continuous training. Students' knowledge was measured using one valid and reliable questionnaire developed by the research team. All students in both groups took a pre-test, and their level of knowledge acquisition was evaluated immediately after the training. Their level of knowledge retention was tested two and four weeks after the lecture. METHODS This was a randomized controlled study with a pre-and post-test design on 64 nurse anesthesia students who were divided into two groups of spaced lecture (n = 32) and conventional lecture (n = 32). The spaced lectures included three 30-minute training sessions with 10-minute intervals while the conventional sessions including 90 min of continuous training. Students' knowledge was measured using one valid and reliable questionnaire developed by the research team. All students in both groups took a pre-test, and their level of knowledge acquisition was evaluated immediately after the training. Their level of knowledge retention was tested two and four weeks after the lecture.There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding demographic characteristics (p > 0.05). In the pre-test, the mean score of knowledge in the intervention group was lower than that in the control group, there was no significant difference (p = 0.177). But after the intervention, the mean scores of learning outcome and retention in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p   0.05). In the pre-test, the mean score of knowledge in the intervention group was lower than that in the control group, there was no significant difference (p = 0.177). But after the intervention, the mean scores of learning outcome and retention in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p < 0.001, eta = 0.576). Also, the results showed that learning outcome and retention across the three academic semesters in the two groups are significantly different, and students with a higher academic semester obtained a significantly higher mean score of knowledge and retention (p < 0.001, eta = 0.604).Spaced learning improves nurse anesthesia students' knowledge and retention more than conventional method. Future studies focusing on spaced learning should specifically examine the impact of duration and number of intervals, as well as the time gap between training and measurement of learning retention. CONCLUSION Spaced learning improves nurse anesthesia students' knowledge and retention more than conventional method. Future studies focusing on spaced learning should specifically examine the impact of duration and number of intervals, as well as the time gap between training and measurement of learning retention.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to be used as a transformative tool in medical education—offering both interactive models and clinical simulations to enhance training. VR presents a space and cost-effective solution for remote education, combined with prospects of higher efficiency and interactivity than traditional training. This study aimed to explore the potential application and perception of VR in a focus group of medical students as an innovative tool for learning anatomy. Sixteen students underwent a structured VR lesson plan exploring concepts in anatomy. Pre- and post-surveys assessed participants’ exposure to VR, previous exposure to and preparedness in anatomy training, and attitudes toward VR. Results revealed that despite limited prior exposure to VR, participants found the technology both easy to navigate and comfortable to use. Notably, over 90% of students indicated that VR would enhance their anatomy learning experience and help them learn a topic better than traditional models. Furthermore, 94% of participants agreed that this learning modality should be offered to medical students, and if given access to this technology, most would utilize it for learning anatomy and potentially for other subjects as well. This study emphasizes VR’s potential to enhance medical education, particularly in anatomy instruction. VR’s adaptability, user-friendly interface, and positive student perceptions highlight its viability as a supplemental tool. Future research should explore specific anatomy applications, long-term impacts on knowledge retention, and the evolving role of VR in medical education.

Abstract: The loss of organizational knowledge has emerged as a prevalent issue for 21st-century organizations. This systematic review aims to scrutinize knowledge transfer procedures applied to individuals in managerial and intermediate positions during generational change or knowledge management initiatives. Following the PRISMA statement [1], this review progressed through four stages, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, and ultimately identifying 28 articles for the final analysis. Descriptive indicators and content-related metrics were employed in the study. Key findings include: (1) predominant investment in knowledge retention studies and procedure design is observed among large companies, primarily in the secondary sector; (2) digitalization emerges as a critical aspect of effective organizational knowledge transfer procedures and protocols; (3) intra-organizational communication styles are predominantly employed for knowledge transfer; (4) organizations prefer a collective approach to transferring both tacit and explicit knowledge. In summary, this research offers fresh insights into a pivotal area of business management, showcasing originality in its exploration of knowledge transfer within the realms of generational change and knowledge management.The loss of organizational knowledge has emerged as a prevalent issue for 21st-century organizations.

Abstract: Aim: To assess the efficacy of a low-cost haemorrhage-control task simulator integrated in a high-fidelity simulation scenario to facilitate knowledge and practical skills acquisition, as well as self-efficacy in haemorrhage control among nursing students. Design: A quasi-experimental before-after design was conducted at the University of Almeria. Methods: A one-group preintervention, immediate postintervention, and a third assessment at three months were performed, with the Stop the Bleed Education Assessment Tool used to evaluate knowledge of haemorrhage control, as well as a 5-point Likert scale used to evaluate perceived self-efficacy. The success of controlling exsanguinating bleeding was determined by quantifying the millilitres lost during the intervention and calculating the time required to control the haemorrhaging. The data were reported using the TREND guidelines. Results: One hundred and three final-year nursing students participated in this study. Significant improvements ( p < 0.001 ) were observed in pre- and posttest total scores on knowledge of bleeding control, self-efficacy, as well as time is taken and volume loss to control the haemorrhage. Similar results were observed between preassessment and three months postassessment with significant improvements ( p < 0.001 ) in all measures. Conclusions: The use of a haemorrhage-control task simulator within a high-fidelity simulation scenario resulted in noteworthy improvements in nursing students’ practical skills, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy. After three months, performance decreased but remained greater than pretraining levels. Thus, broadening the use of this task-training simulator would be of great value to further develop a first responder training approach with healthcare professionals and other laypersons, allowing for greater knowledge distribution and reaching a larger audience. Implications for Nursing Management: The findings underscore the potential efficacy of this simulator as a valuable resource for nursing educators and supervisors to train nursing students and professionals in terms of practical skills, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy in haemorrhage control, fostering a train-the-trainer cascade approach to reach a wider audience and enhance bleeding control proficiency among professionals.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The loss of organizational knowledge has emerged as a prevalent issue for 21st-century organizations. This systematic review aims to scrutinize knowledge transfer procedures applied to individuals in managerial and intermediate positions during generational change or knowledge management initiatives. Following the PRISMA statement [1], this review progressed through four stages, applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, and ultimately identifying 28 articles for the final analysis. Descriptive indicators and content-related metrics were employed in the study. Key findings include: (1) predominant investment in knowledge retention studies and procedure design is observed among large companies, primarily in the secondary sector; (2) digitalization emerges as a critical aspect of effective organizational knowledge transfer procedures and protocols; (3) intra-organizational communication styles are predominantly employed for knowledge transfer; (4) organizations prefer a collective approach to transferring both tacit and explicit knowledge. In summary, this research offers fresh insights into a pivotal area of business management, showcasing originality in its exploration of knowledge transfer within the realms of generational change and knowledge management.

Markets and Metis : Reading Hayek with Scott

Abstract: Both James C. Scott and Friedrich Hayek articulate critiques of centralised state planning that are fundamentally epistemological in character. In particular, both emphasize the loss of knowledge resulting from attempts to achieve synoptic legibility of complex social practices. Yet while Hayek’s critique of central planning leads to an emphasis on the indispensability of the price system, Scott argues that capitalist markets are also mechanisms of perverse simplification. This paper explores the roots of this disagreement and seeks to articulate the insights that emerge from reading Hayek and Scott together on questions of markets, knowledge, and the state.

Abstract: The stability of collaborative organization is crucial for the successful functioning of collaborative product innovation network (CPIN), which is a typical open innovation platform. Knowledge resource loss, especially the human resource and knowledge resource, is the severe challenge for the stability of CPIN. Considering there mainly are two types of elements in CPIN, i.e., members and their knowledge, this paper builds a weighted super-network model for CPIN to integrate the two types of elements. Based on the weighted super-network model, a related nodes removal method is proposed to simulate the member loss and knowledge loss, then the quantitative analytical methods are proposed pertinently to measure and analyze the influence of member loss and knowledge loss on the CPIN stability. The case study results show the methods proposed in this paper can effectively reflect the member loss and knowledge loss, and measure and analyze the influence of their loss on the CPIN stability.

Abstract: This study examined the impact of a pedagogy that is culturally influenced and laced with technological and contextual elements known as the culturo-techno-contextual approach (CTCA) on promoting knowledge retention of biology concepts. The research design was mixed methods, and the sample consisted of 88 senior secondary school II students selected from two Lagos State educational district V schools in Nigeria. Quantitative data was collected using the Variation and Evolution Achievement Test with a reliability value of 0.79, while qualitative data was collected using the Students’ Perception of CTCA Interview Guide. All students in the two sample schools used for the experimental and control groups took a pretest before treatment, a posttest at the end of the treatment phase, and a retention test four weeks later. The ANCOVA output demonstrated a statistically significant difference in knowledge retention [F (1,85) = 134.50; p  < .05]. This suggests that experimental students retained more.

Abstract: The traditional approach to teaching involves the teacher delivering information to the students, who are expected to memorize and regurgitate it during assessments. However, this approach has been criticized for failing to engage students and promote long-term knowledge retention. Activity-Based Learning is an education where youngsters analyze at their own tempo through several supervised activities. It is a more excellent interactive and enticing technique for educating children. It approves monitoring elements such as coordination, speech, motor, and social skills, amongst other important factors. Activity-Based Learning is a fun approach to Learning since it boosts children's brain development by providing constant stimulus and prompting them to respond. Activity-based Learning has gained widespread recognition in education for its efficacy in engaging students and promoting active Learning. This approach provides students with hands-on experiences, practical activities, and real-world scenarios to develop their knowledge and skills. Implementation of activity-based Learning in classroom teaching has become a well-known trend in recent years as educators realize its potential to enhance learning outcomes and improve student engagement. In this introduction, we will discuss the fundamental principles and benefits of activity-based Learning and explore how it can be successfully implemented in the classroom.

Abstract: Innovations in medical education, including the integration of narrative‐based tales, are transforming the way complex biochemical concepts are taught and understood. In this “Idea to Explore”, the essence of integrating tales that personify molecules and depict biochemical processes as engaging stories to enhance student engagement, promote active learning, and improve knowledge retention is discussed. It also explores the effectiveness of scientific discovery games and traditional scientific stories in deepening students' interest in biochemistry. Highlighting the potential of narrative methods to make biochemistry more accessible and engaging, educators are encouraged to adopt creative teaching tools that promote critical thinking, problem‐solving, and communication skills, thereby inspiring active participation, and lifelong learning in biochemistry.

Abstract: The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project was to provide an innovative, participatory approach to the education of staff nurses and nursing support personnel to improve skills and competencies in wound and ostomy care while enhancing staff engagement and empowerment. PURPOSE The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project was to provide an innovative, participatory approach to the education of staff nurses and nursing support personnel to improve skills and competencies in wound and ostomy care while enhancing staff engagement and empowerment.Project planning occurred between January and October 2020 and implementation began in November 2020. The project was implemented in 1 intensive care unit and 6 adult medical-surgical units of a 288-bed community hospital in the northeastern United States (Bronxville, New York). Participants included RNs and nursing support staff working in intensive care and medical-surgical units. A postimplementation survey was conducted in May 2021. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Project planning occurred between January and October 2020 and implementation began in November 2020. The project was implemented in 1 intensive care unit and 6 adult medical-surgical units of a 288-bed community hospital in the northeastern United States (Bronxville, New York). Participants included RNs and nursing support staff working in intensive care and medical-surgical units. A postimplementation survey was conducted in May 2021.The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was used as a framework for this QI intervention. A peer-to-peer approach to staff education addressing different learning styles was used to improve knowledge and competencies of staff nurses pertaining to wound and ostomy care. APPROACH The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was used as a framework for this QI intervention. A peer-to-peer approach to staff education addressing different learning styles was used to improve knowledge and competencies of staff nurses pertaining to wound and ostomy care.There were 72 participants; 68% (n = 49) exhibited knowledge retention 5 months after initial participation; 85% (n = 61) reported a high level of engagement; and 97.5% (n = 70) reported a high level of satisfaction 5 months after project implementation. OUTCOMES There were 72 participants; 68% (n = 49) exhibited knowledge retention 5 months after initial participation; 85% (n = 61) reported a high level of engagement; and 97.5% (n = 70) reported a high level of satisfaction 5 months after project implementation.An emerging need exists for educational innovation regarding wound and ostomy care to improve quality of care, nursing care outcomes, and staff engagement. Through a peer-to-peer approach to wound and ostomy care education, enhanced clinical knowledge and competencies can result in improved patient safety and increase care outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE An emerging need exists for educational innovation regarding wound and ostomy care to improve quality of care, nursing care outcomes, and staff engagement. Through a peer-to-peer approach to wound and ostomy care education, enhanced clinical knowledge and competencies can result in improved patient safety and increase care outcomes.

Abstract: Nursing students struggle to retain enough anatomical knowledge to meet their entry to practice competencies, but what knowledge is missing and when this occurs has been previously unexplored. A cohort of 80 nursing students were given multiple choice quizzes to assess their anatomical knowledge on 11 different organ systems during their second, third, and fourth year. Results were analyzed in comparison to their first‐year examination scores to determine knowledge loss. Results showed an overall knowledge loss of 33.5% in the second year, 31.8% in the third year, and 29.6% in the fourth year. There were significant differences in system specific results. Special senses (i.e., audition) had a 20.6% loss in the second year, increased in retention to a 17.3% loss in third year, and then decreased to a 37% loss in fourth year. The vascular system had a 46.1% knowledge loss at the second‐year assessment, declined to 49% knowledge loss in the third year, but improved to 27.6% knowledge loss by the fourth year. A similar change was observed for the musculoskeletal system with second‐year loss at 30.7%, third‐year loss at 40.3%, and fourth‐year loss at 26.6%. These data suggest there are significant differences in the amount of knowledge retained by nursing students depending on the system being tested and the year the test is taken. Identifying the areas and times where anatomical knowledge is lost and gained is valuable for instructors in any program so that specific topics can be targeted at different times with more effective educational strategies.

Abstract: A large teaching hospital in New York City, New York conducts a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Education Day five times annually for newly hired nurses and advanced practice providers caring for patients receiving BMTs in the inpatient and outpatient settings. In 2022, 60 nurses and advanced practice providers attended the class, with an increase in attendance in 2023 due to the influx of newly hired staff members, the expansion of CAR-T cell therapy and BMT to the outpatient setting, and the conversion of a medical/ oncology unit to a BMT unit, all requiring specialized BMT education. The BMT Education Day consists of a full-day of didactic lectures covering topics including but not limited to an overview of stem cell transplant, precision in research, and adverse events associated with CAR-T and bispecific agents. While the content covered in the lectures is vitally important to the attendees' practice, facilitators have received feedback from attendees regarding the need for new methods to increase learner engagement and knowledge retention. The facilitators of the BMT Education Day utilized Ka- hoot!®, a game-based learning application, to review questions based on the lectures presented as a way to increase learner engagement and knowledge retention. Two Kahoot!® games were created: one for a lecture on common medications used in transplant, and one as an overview of the content covered throughout the day. The transplant pharmacology lecture was chosen for a Kahoot!® because the content is dense, and the learners have often reported difficulty in retaining information regarding the various medications utilized for the BMT patient. The Kahoot!® as an overview of the lectures throughout the day was chosen as a way to summarize the content that was taught in an effort to improve overall knowledge retention. At the submission of this abstract, the Kahoot!® games were utilized at one of the BMT Education Days with an overwhelmingly positive response. Attendees reported that the games helped with their engagement and with their retention and even requested that they be incorporated more throughout the day. Given that there was such positive feedback in response to the game-based applications during BMT day, we plan to continue to utilize Kahoot!®, with plans to incorporate it into more of our educational initiatives both at the hospital and system level.

Abstract: After a diagnosis, individuals are faced with a variety of legal and financial issues. Individuals diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers often have complex questions about insurance coverage, accessing government benefits, and employment. Without accurate information, individuals are unable to make educated decisions and may suffer the financial consequences of losing their job, insurance, or even their home. Financial toxicity is directly connected to lower quality of life and reduced treatment compliance, so it is imperative individuals have access to resources to mitigate financial burden. In order to mitigate financial toxicity, it is crucial individuals diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers have access to the resources needed to make informed decisions about legal and practical matters. Health care providers (HCPs), including nurses, are uniquely qualified to connect individuals with relevant resources; however, there is a gap in formal training around these topics. With the proper information, HCPs can help guide patients through decisions around health insurance, employment, navigating finances, and more. Triage Cancer® created the free Insurance & Finance Intensive to educate HCPs about cancer-related legal issues, so they have the necessary tools to help their patients reduce the financial burden of a cancer diagnosis. The Intensive educates HCPs about how to identify cancer-related legal issues and which resources their patients may find helpful in navigating their situation to mitigate financial toxicity. The Intensive provides an overview of the US health care system; individual, employer-sponsored, and government health insurance; employment; disability insurance; and managing finances. The interactive format, including case studies, exercises, and frequently updated information, allows HCPs to develop a foundational understanding of the material. Since 2017, the Intensive has been provided 45 times to 2,446 HCPs in 49 states and Washington D.C. Respondents to the follow-up survey reported: · Adjusting their approach based on what they learned at the training (96%) · Knowledge retention six months later (80%) · Sharing information learned in the training with patients (89%) · Agreed or strongly agreed that the information provided by the training improved the quality of life of their patients and families (93%) The Intensive provides critical education to HCPs about cancer-related legal issues. This training enables HCPs to support their patients and their families with accurate information and referrals to resources, in order to mitigate financial toxicity and improve their quality of life.

Abstract: Progress tests (PT) are a popular type of longitudinal assessment used for evaluating clinical knowledge retention and long-life learning in health professions education. Most PTs consist of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) whose development is costly and time-consuming. Automatic Item Generation (AIG) generates test items through algorithms, promising to ease this burden. However, it remains unclear how AIG-items behave in formative assessment (FA) modalities such as PTs compared to manually written items. The purpose of this study was to compare the quality and validity of AIG-items versus manually written items. Responses to 126 (23 automatically generated) dichotomously scored single best-answer five-option MCQs retrieved from the 2021 University of Minho PT of medicine were analyzed. Procedures based on item response theory (IRT), dimensionality testing, item fit, reliability, differential item functioning (DIF) and distractor analysis were used. Qualitative assessment was conducted through expert review. Validity evidence of AIG-items was assessed by using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM). The PT proved to be a viable tool for assessing medical students cognitive competencies. AIG-items were parallel to manually written-items, presenting similar indices of difficulty and information. The proportion of functional distractors for both AIG and manually written items was similar. Evidence of validity for AIG-items was found while showing higher levels of item quality. AIG-items functioned as intended and were appropriate for evaluating medical students at various levels of the knowledge spectrum.

Abstract: Nursing students struggle to retain enough anatomical knowledge to meet their entry to practice competencies, but what knowledge is missing and when this occurs has been previously unexplored. A cohort of 80 nursing students were given multiple choice quizzes to assess their anatomical knowledge on 11 different organ systems during their second, third, and fourth year. Results were analyzed in comparison to their first‐year examination scores to determine knowledge loss. Results showed an overall knowledge loss of 33.5% in the second year, 31.8% in the third year, and 29.6% in the fourth year. There were significant differences in system specific results. Special senses (i.e., audition) had a 20.6% loss in the second year, increased in retention to a 17.3% loss in third year, and then decreased to a 37% loss in fourth year. The vascular system had a 46.1% knowledge loss at the second‐year assessment, declined to 49% knowledge loss in the third year, but improved to 27.6% knowledge loss by the fourth year. A similar change was observed for the musculoskeletal system with second‐year loss at 30.7%, third‐year loss at 40.3%, and fourth‐year loss at 26.6%. These data suggest there are significant differences in the amount of knowledge retained by nursing students depending on the system being tested and the year the test is taken. Identifying the areas and times where anatomical knowledge is lost and gained is valuable for instructors in any program so that specific topics can be targeted at different times with more effective educational strategies.

Abstract: Innovations in medical education, including the integration of narrative-based tales, are transforming the way complex biochemical concepts are taught and understood. In this "Idea to Explore", the essence of integrating tales that personify molecules and depict biochemical processes as engaging stories to enhance student engagement, promote active learning, and improve knowledge retention is discussed. It also explores the effectiveness of scientific discovery games and traditional scientific stories in deepening students' interest in biochemistry. Highlighting the potential of narrative methods to make biochemistry more accessible and engaging, educators are encouraged to adopt creative teaching tools that promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, thereby inspiring active participation, and lifelong learning in biochemistry.Innovations in medical education, including the integration of narrative-based tales, are transforming the way complex biochemical concepts are taught and understood.

Abstract: Clinical pharmacogenomics is an expanding area in healthcare that relies heavily on pharmacists for advocacy and implementation. To support pharmacists' significant roles in clinical pharmacogenomics, pharmacy schools and colleges in the United States (US) have strived to incorporate pharmacogenomics education into their curricula, and various teaching strategies have been employed in recent years to meet pharmacogenomics educational outcomes. The six major strategies reported in the literature are described and compared in this review, which culminates in a proposed longitudinal curriculum design for pharmacogenomics education. BACKGROUND Clinical pharmacogenomics is an expanding area in healthcare that relies heavily on pharmacists for advocacy and implementation. To support pharmacists' significant roles in clinical pharmacogenomics, pharmacy schools and colleges in the United States (US) have strived to incorporate pharmacogenomics education into their curricula, and various teaching strategies have been employed in recent years to meet pharmacogenomics educational outcomes. The six major strategies reported in the literature are described and compared in this review, which culminates in a proposed longitudinal curriculum design for pharmacogenomics education.Publications focused on pharmacogenomics education to pharmacy students within the US in the past decade were evaluated and summarized. METHODS Publications focused on pharmacogenomics education to pharmacy students within the US in the past decade were evaluated and summarized.The major education strategies that have been studied are didactic lecture, personal genotyping or personal genomic testing, simulation laboratory activity, interprofessional education, practice-based activity such as clinical rotation, and combinational courses. Strengths and limitations of each teaching strategy are summarized and discussed. RESULTS The major education strategies that have been studied are didactic lecture, personal genotyping or personal genomic testing, simulation laboratory activity, interprofessional education, practice-based activity such as clinical rotation, and combinational courses. Strengths and limitations of each teaching strategy are summarized and discussed.Based upon each education strategy's strengths and weaknesses, the authors propose a longitudinal curriculum design to ensure that pharmacogenomics is taught multiple times to pharmacy students with diverse formats and teaching objectives conducive to long-term knowledge retention and practice readiness. Through this longitudinal curriculum design, pharmacy graduates will be well equipped to lead clinical pharmacogenomics in practice. IMPLICATIONS Based upon each education strategy's strengths and weaknesses, the authors propose a longitudinal curriculum design to ensure that pharmacogenomics is taught multiple times to pharmacy students with diverse formats and teaching objectives conducive to long-term knowledge retention and practice readiness. Through this longitudinal curriculum design, pharmacy graduates will be well equipped to lead clinical pharmacogenomics in practice.

Abstract: Nursing students struggle to retain enough anatomical knowledge to meet their entry to practice competencies, but what knowledge is missing and when this occurs has been previously unexplored. A cohort of 80 nursing students were given multiple choice quizzes to assess their anatomical knowledge on 11 different organ systems during their second, third, and fourth year. Results were analyzed in comparison to their first-year examination scores to determine knowledge loss. Results showed an overall knowledge loss of 33.5% in the second year, 31.8% in the third year, and 29.6% in the fourth year. There were significant differences in system specific results. Special senses (i.e., audition) had a 20.6% loss in the second year, increased in retention to a 17.3% loss in third year, and then decreased to a 37% loss in fourth year. The vascular system had a 46.1% knowledge loss at the second-year assessment, declined to 49% knowledge loss in the third year, but improved to 27.6% knowledge loss by the fourth year. A similar change was observed for the musculoskeletal system with second-year loss at 30.7%, third-year loss at 40.3%, and fourth-year loss at 26.6%. These data suggest there are significant differences in the amount of knowledge retained by nursing students depending on the system being tested and the year the test is taken. Identifying the areas and times where anatomical knowledge is lost and gained is valuable for instructors in any program so that specific topics can be targeted at different times with more effective educational strategies.Nursing students struggle to retain enough anatomical knowledge to meet their entry to practice competencies, but what knowledge is missing and when this occurs has been previously unexplored.

Abstract: In the task incremental learning problem, deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously seen classes/tasks as they are trained on new classes/tasks. This problem becomes even harder when some of the test classes do not belong to the training class set, i.e., the task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem. We propose a novel approach to address the task incremental learning problem for both the non zero-shot and zero-shot settings. Our proposed approach, called Rectification-based Knowledge Retention (RKR), applies weight rectifications and affine transformations for adapting the model to any task. During testing, our approach can use the task label information (task-aware) to quickly adapt the network to that task. We also extend our approach to make it task-agnostic so that it can work even when the task label information is not available during testing. Specifically, given a continuum of test data, our approach predicts the task and quickly adapts the network to the predicted task. We experimentally show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets for both non zero-shot and zero-shot task incremental learning.In the task incremental learning problem, deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting of previously seen classes/tasks as they are trained on new classes/tasks.

Abstract: Older adults deserve special healthcare provision in every branch of medicine. Turkey currently does not have geriatric emergency medicine (GEM) subspecialty training. Thus, interprofessional training for healthcare professionals involved in GEM services is required. Team-based learning (TBL) seems suitable to implement such training. We aimed to develop and implement a training program for healthcare professionals engaged with GEM services, and evaluate the program considering teacher and learner satisfaction and knowledge retention. Background Older adults deserve special healthcare provision in every branch of medicine. Turkey currently does not have geriatric emergency medicine (GEM) subspecialty training. Thus, interprofessional training for healthcare professionals involved in GEM services is required. Team-based learning (TBL) seems suitable to implement such training. We aimed to develop and implement a training program for healthcare professionals engaged with GEM services, and evaluate the program considering teacher and learner satisfaction and knowledge retention.This was a design-based study in which a one-day GEM training program was developed based on the literature and expert opinions. The program was applied to 54 physicians, 98 nurses, 70 health officers, and 102 paramedics using a modified version of TBL. Teams included at least one representative from each profession. TBL was modified by adding a 1-h lecture and eliminating peer evaluation. Feedback forms, individual and group tests of TBL, and a retention test conducted six months later were used for program evaluation. Methods This was a design-based study in which a one-day GEM training program was developed based on the literature and expert opinions. The program was applied to 54 physicians, 98 nurses, 70 health officers, and 102 paramedics using a modified version of TBL. Teams included at least one representative from each profession. TBL was modified by adding a 1-h lecture and eliminating peer evaluation. Feedback forms, individual and group tests of TBL, and a retention test conducted six months later were used for program evaluation.The mean group test score was higher than that of individual tests in all professions. Physicians' individual test scores were higher than those of other professions, but this difference disappeared in the group test. The retention test mean score was higher than the individual test mean score but lower than that of the group test. Teacher and learner satisfaction was high. Results The mean group test score was higher than that of individual tests in all professions. Physicians' individual test scores were higher than those of other professions, but this difference disappeared in the group test. The retention test mean score was higher than the individual test mean score but lower than that of the group test. Teacher and learner satisfaction was high.We implemented a training program using a modified TBL approach to teach GEM to relevant healthcare professionals; it yielded promising results regarding knowledge gain and retention, as well as teacher and learner satisfaction. The instruction design and method used in this study can be applied to multidisciplinary team training. Conclusion We implemented a training program using a modified TBL approach to teach GEM to relevant healthcare professionals; it yielded promising results regarding knowledge gain and retention, as well as teacher and learner satisfaction. The instruction design and method used in this study can be applied to multidisciplinary team training.

Abstract: Sustaining evidence-based practices (EBPs) is crucial to ensuring care quality and addressing health disparities. Approaches to identifying factors related to sustainability are critically needed. One such approach is Matrixed Multiple Case Study (MMCS), which identifies factors and their combinations that influence implementation. We applied MMCS to identify factors related to the sustainability of the evidence-based Collaborative Chronic Care Model (CCM) at nine Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient mental health clinics, 3-4 years after implementation support had concluded. BACKGROUND Sustaining evidence-based practices (EBPs) is crucial to ensuring care quality and addressing health disparities. Approaches to identifying factors related to sustainability are critically needed. One such approach is Matrixed Multiple Case Study (MMCS), which identifies factors and their combinations that influence implementation. We applied MMCS to identify factors related to the sustainability of the evidence-based Collaborative Chronic Care Model (CCM) at nine Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient mental health clinics, 3-4 years after implementation support had concluded.We conducted a directed content analysis of 30 provider interviews, using 6 CCM elements and 4 Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) domains as codes. Based on CCM code summaries, we designated each site as high/medium/low sustainability. We used i-PARIHS code summaries to identify relevant factors for each site, the extent of their presence, and the type of influence they had on sustainability (enabling/neutral/hindering/unclear). We organized these data into a sortable matrix and assessed sustainability-related cross-site trends. METHODS We conducted a directed content analysis of 30 provider interviews, using 6 CCM elements and 4 Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) domains as codes. Based on CCM code summaries, we designated each site as high/medium/low sustainability. We used i-PARIHS code summaries to identify relevant factors for each site, the extent of their presence, and the type of influence they had on sustainability (enabling/neutral/hindering/unclear). We organized these data into a sortable matrix and assessed sustainability-related cross-site trends.CCM sustainability status was distributed among the sites, with three sites each being high, medium, and low. Twenty-five factors were identified from the i-PARIHS code summaries, of which 3 exhibited strong trends by sustainability status (relevant i-PARIHS domain in square brackets): "Collaborativeness/Teamwork [Recipients]," "Staff/Leadership turnover [Recipients]," and "Having a consistent/strong internal facilitator [Facilitation]" during and after active implementation. At most high-sustainability sites only, (i) "Having a knowledgeable/helpful external facilitator [Facilitation]" was variably present and enabled sustainability when present, while (ii) "Clarity about what CCM comprises [Innovation]," "Interdisciplinary coordination [Recipients]," and "Adequate clinic space for CCM team members [Context]" were somewhat or less present with mixed influences on sustainability. RESULTS CCM sustainability status was distributed among the sites, with three sites each being high, medium, and low. Twenty-five factors were identified from the i-PARIHS code summaries, of which 3 exhibited strong trends by sustainability status (relevant i-PARIHS domain in square brackets): "Collaborativeness/Teamwork [Recipients]," "Staff/Leadership turnover [Recipients]," and "Having a consistent/strong internal facilitator [Facilitation]" during and after active implementation.

These findings have informed a subsequent CCM implementation trial that prospectively examines whether enhancing the above-mentioned factors within implementation facilitation improves sustainability. MMCS is a systematic approach to multi-site examination that can be used to investigate sustainability-related factors applicable to other EBPs and across multiple contexts.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Older adults deserve special healthcare provision in every branch of medicine. Turkey currently does not have geriatric emergency medicine (GEM) subspecialty training. Thus, interprofessional training for healthcare professionals involved in GEM services is required. Team-based learning (TBL) seems suitable to implement such training. We aimed to develop and implement a training program for healthcare professionals engaged with GEM services, and evaluate the program considering teacher and learner satisfaction and knowledge retention. This was a design-based study in which a one-day GEM training program was developed based on the literature and expert opinions. The program was applied to 54 physicians, 98 nurses, 70 health officers, and 102 paramedics using a modified version of TBL. Teams included at least one representative from each profession. TBL was modified by adding a 1-h lecture and eliminating peer evaluation. Feedback forms, individual and group tests of TBL, and a retention test conducted six months later were used for program evaluation. The mean group test score was higher than that of individual tests in all professions. Physicians’ individual test scores were higher than those of other professions, but this difference disappeared in the group test. The retention test mean score was higher than the individual test mean score but lower than that of the group test. Teacher and learner satisfaction was high. We implemented a training program using a modified TBL approach to teach GEM to relevant healthcare professionals; it yielded promising results regarding knowledge gain and retention, as well as teacher and learner satisfaction. The instruction design and method used in this study can be applied to multidisciplinary team training.

Abstract: In May 2021 a group of 96 classical antiquities was seized from Fordham University where they had formed part of their museum collection. The seizure was directly linked to the investigation by US authorities of objects that had been handled by the dealer Edoardo Almagià. The Fordham material was dominated by objects derived from Italy: Apulian, Campanian, and Paestan figure-decorated pottery; red-on-white ware associated with Crustumerium in Lazio; and Etruscan pottery, architectural terracottas, and terracotta votives. The objects were all donated to Fordham by William D. Walsh and had largely been acquired at auctions or through a narrow group of Manhattan galleries.

Abstract: Public demands for high-quality healthcare require medical schools to ensure that physicians attain various competencies, including professionalism and humanism. This can be accomplished through various interactions and socialisations within the healthcare community. These meaningful learning experiences become more critical as students face unpredictable learning opportunities in clinical settings. However, professional development focuses on lapses, remediation and knowledge retention rather than its practice. To nurture professional and humanistic physicians, this study explores how medical students perceive learning professionalism in clinical settings.

Methods This is a qualitative phenomenology study involving medical students in clinical rotations at the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia. Respondents were chosen through a purposive sampling method that considered their gender and clinical years. Data were collected through focus group discussions (FGDs) and thematic analysis was used.Three FGDs were conducted with 31 clinical students. Learning professionalism in clinical settings presents challenges, including the hidden curriculum (HC), limited exposure to patients and the clinical learning environment because of the social restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The tailored strategy to learn professionalism in the clinical learning environment was more teacher-driven, including role modelling, debriefing, providing feedback and teaching context-specific knowledge on professionalism, followed by patient interactions.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Dental Practicality Index (DPI) training using an online video on the treatment planning decisions and confidence level of dental undergraduates (DUs). Objectives The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of Dental Practicality Index (DPI) training using an online video on the treatment planning decisions and confidence level of dental undergraduates (DUs).Ninety-four DUs were shown 15 clinical case scenarios and asked to decide on treatment plans based on 4 treatment options. The most appropriate treatment plan had been decided by a consensus panel of experienced dentists. DUs then underwent DPI training using an online video. In a post-DPI-training test, DUs were shown the same clinical case scenarios and asked to assign the best treatment option. After 6 weeks, DUs were retested to assess their knowledge retention. In all 3 tests, DUs completed the confidence level scale questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank test and the independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test with the level of significance set at p < 0.05. Materials and Methods Ninety-four DUs were shown 15 clinical case scenarios and asked to decide on treatment plans based on 4 treatment options. The most appropriate treatment plan had been decided by a consensus panel of experienced dentists. DUs then underwent DPI training using an online video. In a post-DPI-training test, DUs were shown the same clinical case scenarios and asked to assign the best treatment option. After 6 weeks, DUs were retested to assess their knowledge retention. In all 3 tests, DUs completed the confidence level scale questionnaire. Data were analyzed using the related-samples Wilcoxon signed rank test and the independent-samples Mann-Whitney U test with the level of significance set at p < 0.05.DPI training significantly improved the mean scores of the DUs from 7.53 in the pre-DPI-training test to 9.01 in the post-DPI-training test ( p < 0.001). After 6 weeks, the mean scores decreased marginally to 8.87 in the retention test ( p = 0.563). DPI training increased their confidence level from 5.68 pre-DPI training to 7.09 post-DPI training. Results DPI training significantly improved the mean scores of the DUs from 7.53 in the pre-DPI-training test to 9.01 in the post-DPI-training test (p < 0.001). After 6 weeks, the mean scores decreased marginally to 8.87 in the retention test (p = 0.563). DPI training increased their confidence level from 5.68 pre-DPI training to 7.09 post-DPI training.Training DUs using DPI with an online video improved their decision-making and confidence level in treatment planning. Conclusions Training DUs using DPI with an online video improved their decision-making and confidence level in treatment planning.

Abstract: Aim To explore nursing students’ perceptions of their design thinking learning experiences on a human development course. Background Design thinking is a person-centered analytic and creative learning process that promotes higher order thinking skills rather than knowledge retention alone. Currently, this is the first study that has investigated the use of the design thinking process for nursing students on a human development course. Design A phenomenological research design. Methods The participants were first-year nursing students enrolled on a human development course at a Taiwanese university. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2022 and sufficiently high information power was obtained after 15 participants were interviewed. Data were systematically analysed, summarized and decoded using Colaizzi’s seven analysis steps. Results Three themes and twelve subthemes emerged from the data. (1) Challenges experienced with the design thinking learning process: participants experienced anxiety because of the unfamiliar assignments, and they found the assignments to be thought-consuming, time-consuming and energy-consuming, plus the students needed to adapt to working in teams with classmates. (2) Adjustment strategies employed by participants: participants highlighted the importance of teamwork during the design thinking learning process. They achieved consensus through communication and sought support from others to overcome challenges related to design thinking; however, they ultimately needed to engage in problem-solving by themselves. (3) Developing the diversity of academic capabilities: after the human development course, participants experienced enriched mindsets, cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, interpersonal relationships and knowledge application. Conclusions Design thinking provides creative teaching opportunities and encourages nursing students to engage in experimental and creative learning, which is a meaningful experience for them. Nurse educators could use the insights thus obtained to design a curriculum that sources design thinking as a learning process while facilitating the complexity and diversity of students’ higher order thinking skills and not just repetitive learning.

Abstract: Aim/objective The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the characteristics and outcomes of education interventions for nurses focused on delirium assessment and management. Background Delirium is a prevalent acute and reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome in hospitalized patients. Delirium can cause cognitive, psychiatric and physical impairments and result in prolonged hospital stay, increased risk of readmission and elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Nurses play an essential role in managing delirium. There is a lack of understanding of the existing nursing educational interventions on delirium management. Design The study was a scoping review. Methods In this scoping review, we used Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) scoping review framework. We searched articles published between 2019 and 2023 in Academic Search Premier, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and MEDLINE using the following CINAHL/MeSH suggested subject terms: “delirium” in conjunction with “education” “intervention” and “nurse”, “nurses” or “nursing.” Studies on improving nursing knowledge and practices regarding delirium were included while those focusing on nursing students were excluded. Initial screening involved evaluating article titles and abstracts for relevance from 164 identified articles, followed by a full-text review of 42 articles. Finally, 17 articles were selected for comprehensive analysis. We extracted relevant information from each article and charted the findings in an evidence table. Results The 17 selected articles showcased a variety of interventions used to educate nursing staff, such as workshops, simulations, group discussions, online modules and one-on-one coaching. Educational interventions primarily focused on delirium definition, risk factors, assessment and management. These educational interventions enhanced nurses' perception of delirium, boosting their confidence and knowledge in managing delirium. These interventions also led to increased compliance with delirium assessment and management protocols, which ultimately resulted in improved documentation accuracy and patient outcomes. Conclusions Findings from this scoping review suggest that nursing administration need to provide support and education for delirium prevention and management to enhance nursing staff confidence and competence in assessing and managing delirium. The use of interactive educational techniques has demonstrated profound benefits in schema development, expertize promotion and critical thinking. These findings have significant implications for future research, including the identification of essential nursing competencies for educational interventions and the assessment of long-term knowledge retention and its application in nursing practice.

Abstract: The fault diagnosis method based on domain adaptation is a hot topic in recent years. It is difficult to collect a complete data set containing all fault categories in practice under the same working condition, leading to fault categories knowledge loss in the single source domain. To resolve the problem, a domain adaptation method for bearing fault diagnosis using multiple incomplete source data is proposed in this study. First, the cycle generative adversarial network is used to learn the mapping between multi-source domains to complement the missing category data. Then, considering the domain mismatch problem, a multi-source domain adaption model based on anchor adapters is developed to obtain general domain invariant diagnosis knowledge. Finally, the fault diagnosis model is established by an ensemble of multi-classifier results. Extensive experiments on bearing data sets demonstrate that the proposed method in fault diagnosis with multiple incomplete source data is effective and has a good diagnosis performance.

Abstract: Background and objectives Correct child car restraint use significantly reduces risk of death and serious injury in motor vehicle crashes, but millions of US children ride with improper restraints. We created a tablet-based car restraint educational intervention using Computer Intervention Authoring Software (CIAS) and examined its impact on knowledge and behaviours among parents in the paediatric emergency department (PED). Methods This was a non-blinded, randomised controlled trial of parents of PED patients ages 0–12 years. Participants were evaluated for baseline car restraint knowledge and behaviour. The intervention group completed an interactive tablet-based module, while the control group received printed handouts on car restraint safety. After 1 week, both groups received a follow-up survey assessing changes in car restraint knowledge and behaviour. Logistic regressions determined predictors of knowledge retention and behavioural changes. Parents in the CIAS group were also surveyed on programme acceptability. Results 211 parents completed the study with follow-up data. There was no significant difference in baseline car restraint knowledge (74.3% correct in intervention, 61.8% in control, p=0.15), or increase in follow-up restraint knowledge. Significantly more intervention-group caregivers reported modifying their child’s car restraint at follow-up (52.5% vs 31.8%,p=0.003), and 93.7% of them found CIAS helpful in learning to improve car safety. Conclusion Parents had overall high levels of car restraint knowledge. Using CIAS led to positive behavioural changes regarding child car restraint safety, with the vast majority reporting positive attitudes towards CIAS. This novel, interactive, tablet-based tool is a useful PED intervention for behavioural change in parents. Trial registration number NCT03799393 .

Abstract: To explore nursing students' perceptions of their design thinking learning experiences on a human development course. AIM To explore nursing students' perceptions of their design thinking learning experiences on a human development course.Design thinking is a person-centered analytic and creative learning process that promotes higher order thinking skills rather than knowledge retention alone. Currently, this is the first study that has investigated the use of the design thinking process for nursing students on a human development course. BACKGROUND Design thinking is a person-centered analytic and creative learning process that promotes higher order thinking skills rather than knowledge retention alone. Currently, this is the first study that has investigated the use of the design thinking process for nursing students on a human development course.A phenomenological research design. DESIGN A phenomenological research design.The participants were first-year nursing students enrolled on a human development course at a Taiwanese university. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2022 and sufficiently high information power was obtained after 15 participants were interviewed. Data were systematically analysed, summarized and decoded using Colaizzi's seven analysis steps. METHODS The participants were first-year nursing students enrolled on a human development course at a Taiwanese university. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2022 and sufficiently high information power was obtained after 15 participants were interviewed. Data were systematically analysed, summarized and decoded using Colaizzi's seven analysis steps.Three themes and twelve subthemes emerged from the data. (1) Challenges experienced with the design thinking learning process: participants experienced anxiety because of the unfamiliar assignments, and they found the assignments to be thought-consuming, time-consuming and energy-consuming, plus the students needed to adapt to working in teams with classmates. (2) Adjustment strategies employed by participants: participants highlighted the importance of teamwork during the design thinking learning process. They achieved consensus through communication and sought support from others to overcome challenges related to design thinking; however, they ultimately needed to engage in problem-solving by themselves. (3) Developing the diversity of academic capabilities: after the human development course, participants experienced enriched mindsets, cognitive abilities, problem-solving skills, interpersonal relationships and knowledge application. RESULTS Three themes and twelve subthemes emerged from the data.

Nurse educators could use the insights thus obtained to design a curriculum that sources design thinking as a learning process while facilitating the complexity and diversity of students' higher order thinking skills and not just repetitive learning. CONCLUSIONS Design thinking provides creative teaching opportunities and encourages nursing students to engage in experimental and creative learning, which is a meaningful experience for them. Nurse educators could use the insights thus obtained to design a curriculum that sources design thinking as a learning process while facilitating the complexity and diversity of students' higher order thinking skills and not just repetitive learning.

Abstract: Educational podcast series are becoming increasingly popular as free open access medical education (FOAMed) resources, however, the educational benefit associated with their use is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the educational outcomes associated with the implementation of a surgical podcast series for undergraduate medical students. OBJECTIVE Educational podcast series are becoming increasingly popular as free open access medical education (FOAMed) resources, however, the educational benefit associated with their use is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the educational outcomes associated with the implementation of a surgical podcast series for undergraduate medical students.Two conversational case-based podcast episodes were recorded covering 2 common surgical presentations. Final-year medical students were recruited prospectively in January 2023 and underwent a baseline multiple choice question (MCQ) test covering the material within the podcast episodes. Participants were then provided with the episode files through encrypted Google Drive links. Two weeks following baseline assessment, students repeated the initial MCQ test and completed a postpodcast reaction survey. Data were analyzed using a paired t-test, multivariable regression analyses, and simple descriptive statistics. METHODS Two conversational case-based podcast episodes were recorded covering 2 common surgical presentations. Final-year medical students were recruited prospectively in January 2023 and underwent a baseline multiple choice question (MCQ) test covering the material within the podcast episodes. Participants were then provided with the episode files through encrypted Google Drive links. Two weeks following baseline assessment, students repeated the initial MCQ test and completed a postpodcast reaction survey. Data were analyzed using a paired t-test, multivariable regression analyses, and simple descriptive statistics.Fifty students were enrolled in the study. All participants undertook the baseline assessment. About 98% completed the postpodcast MCQ, while 94% completed the postpodcast reaction survey. All participants who undertook the reaction survey (n = 47) found the podcast helpful in explaining surgical concepts, 92% of participants found the podcast enjoyable to listen to. The most commonly reported activity undertaken while listening was "commuting/driving" (n = 24, 48%). The mean baseline MCQ score was 44.6%. The mean postpodcast MCQ score was 65.51%. There was a mean absolute increase in test score of 20.2% from baseline which was statistically significant (95%CI 14.67-25.6, p < 0.001). RESULTS Fifty students were enrolled in the study. All participants undertook the baseline assessment. About 98% completed the postpodcast MCQ, while 94% completed the postpodcast reaction survey.

There was a mean absolute increase in test score of 20.2% from baseline which was statistically significant (95%CI 14.67-25.6, p < 0.001).Implementation of this podcast series was associated with a statistically significant improvement in mean test score from baseline, reflecting knowledge acquisition. There was a positive user reaction and students were able to listen while performing other activities. Further evaluation of the educational outcomes associated with podcast use, particularly the effects on knowledge retention and clinical competence, is required. CONCLUSION Implementation of this podcast series was associated with a statistically significant improvement in mean test score from baseline, reflecting knowledge acquisition. There was a positive user reaction and students were able to listen while performing other activities. Further evaluation of the educational outcomes associated with podcast use, particularly the effects on knowledge retention and clinical competence, is required.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Microlearning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students’ accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.

Abstract: Methods based on deep learning have shown good advantages in skin lesion recognition. However, the diversity of lesion shapes and the influence of noise disturbances such as hair, bubbles, and markers leads to large intra-class differences and small inter-class similarities, which existing methods have not yet effectively resolved. In addition, most existing methods enhance the performance of skin lesion recognition by improving deep learning models without considering the guidance of medical knowledge of skin lesions. In this paper, we innovatively construct feature associations between different lesions using medical knowledge, and design a medical domain knowledge loss function (MDKLoss) based on these associations. By expanding the gap between samples of various lesion categories, MDKLoss enhances the capacity of deep learning models to differentiate between different lesions and consequently boosts classification performance. Extensive experiments on ISIC2018 and ISIC2019 datasets show that the proposed method achieves a maximum of 91.6% and 87.6% accuracy. Furthermore, compared with existing state-of-the-art loss functions, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness, universality, and superiority.Methods based on deep learning have shown good advantages in skin lesion recognition.

Abstract: This study explored various knowledge management (KM) practices within architectural firms in South Africa, Gauteng province. The research aim was to explore how architects implement KM and identify the factors that encourage or hinder their KM practices. By doing so, the study aimed to develop an implementation strategy for KM practice in architectural firms in order to enhance KM, improve project outcomes and organisational performance. The investigation was grounded in Nonaka's theory of organisational knowledge creation from the dynamic interaction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge through socialisation, externalisation, combination, and internalisation (SECI). The research objectives were to determine architects' perspectives regarding KM, identify the factors that encourage architects to implement KM, investigate the challenges architects face when implementing KM, and develop an implementation strategy for KM practice in architectural firms. The research methodology to develop a KM implementation strategy adopted an interpretive research philosophy, utilising abductive reasoning to combine interview data with existing knowledge. A qualitative research design was employed with a multi-case study strategy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with architects from five architectural firms to gather in-depth insights into their KM practices. The data collected were analysed thematically to identify patterns and draw meaningful conclusions about KM practices, challenges, and strategies. Findings from the study revealed that while large architectural firms tend to develop tailored KM systems, smaller firms often need more structured KM processes. The research highlighted the importance of fostering a learning culture within firms, which includes continuous professional development, open communication, and creating an environment conducive to knowledge sharing. The study emphasised the role of leadership in promoting KM and the need for management to support and participate actively in KM initiatives. The study underscored the crucial role of technology, particularly Building Information Modelling (BIM), in facilitating effective KM by providing platforms for storing, sharing, and accessing knowledge. BIM enhances design and construction processes and serves as a repository for project knowledge, thus aiding in the preservation and transfer of knowledge across projects. Despite the benefits of KM, several challenges were identified. These included difficulties in capturing and sharing tacit knowledge, time constraints, budget limitations, the temporary nature of project teams, lack of a systematic approach to KM leading to inefficiencies and knowledge loss. To address these challenges, the proposed KM implementation strategy recommends eleven action statements beginning with knowledge identification and ending with continuous improvement. The recommendation includes documentation protocols, promoting affordable technology solutions, facilitating knowledge sharing through workshops, and ensuring ethical iv and financial compliance, fostering a collaborative culture, investing in continuous professional development, and integrating KM into the firm's strategic objectives. The value of the proposed KM implementation strategy is the structured approach to KM that addresses the identified challenges and leverages the factors that encourage KM adoption. In this manner architectural firms can enhance their KM practices, improve project outcomes and overall organisational performance. In conclusion, the study underscored the critical role of KM in the architectural industry and provided actionable recommendations for architectural firms to improve their KM practices. The findings and recommendations from this study can help architectural firms in South Africa and beyond to harness the full potential of their knowledge assets, thereby achieving greater efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage.

An Interpretation of VhaVenda and AmaZulu Waist Belts: Coloniality of Culture

Author: Mthethwa, Khanya

Abstract: This thesis examines the enduring influence of coloniality on the cultural practices and material heritage of the AmaZulu and VhaVenda people, with a specific focus on waist belts as symbols of identity, resilience, and adaptation. Through the lens of coloniality of culture, the study traces how colonial power has reconfigured indigenous knowledge systems and reshaped cultural expressions, often relegating them to the periphery of wider societal narratives. This research engages directly with AmaZulu and VhaVenda women as co-researchers using decolonial methodologies rooted in relational ontology and epistemology. Their dialogues offer varied insights into the waist belts’ symbolic and practical roles across generations and geographies. Through these conversations, the study explores the differences in cultural knowledge retention and interpretation between urban and rural communities, highlighting the intersection of gender, location, and colonial influence. The analysis reveals how waist belts, such as the Venda muvhofho and the Zulu isifociya, encapsulate the layered histories of cultural continuity, resistance, and transformation. These objects, often dismissed as mere "craft," are reframed as critical sites of indigenous knowledge and lived experience. This work advocates for a reconceptualization of indigenous material culture within academic discourse, challenging the dominance of Eurocentric paradigms and emphasizing the importance of preserving and valuing indigenous perspectives. Through this decolonial inquiry, the thesis contributes to the broader conversation on how material culture can illuminate the persistent effects of coloniality and serves as a call to reimagine research practices that center and respect indigenous voices.

Abstract: The continuous advancement of science and technology in healthcare demands an adequate response from healthcare institutions and professionals to uphold the standards of healthcare quality and safety. Leveraging Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) emerges as a promising solution for enhancing access to continuing education. Therefore, implementing an m-learning strategy tailored to the specific requirements of healthcare professionals, developed by expert trainers, and endorsed by reputable institutions stands out as an optimal approach to meet this objective. This study aimed to implement a pedagogical approach using mobile learning within the context of continuing education in nursing in a hospital environment. This initiative is underpinned by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), the dematerialization of the traditional training model, and the incorporation of gamified learning methodologies. The study was conducted in three phases: preparation, development and implementation, and evaluation. An exploratory and descriptive study, followed by a quasi-experimental study employing pre- and post-test, were carried out. A panel of experts in continuing education in nursing participated in the development phase. The evaluation phase included a non-probabilistic convenience sample of 168 nurses recruited from the Medical Department of a hospital in northern Portugal who freely accepted to participate in the study. Based on the findings of the preparatory phase, a pedagogical strategy was developed and implemented and made accessible through a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) format available on an online platform. This MOOC incorporated virtual clinical simulation to enhance clinical decision-making skills. The outcomes indicate a high level of satisfaction among nurses after using the MOOC – Ecare COPD - and their intention to integrate this pedagogical approach into their continuing education (M=4.50; DP±0.59). Participants perceived the MOOC as highly useful (M=4.43; SD±0.64) and easy to use (M=4.46; SD±0.64). The strategy’s efficacy was significant for knowledge retention [t (167) = 16.697, p<.001, Cohen's d =1.28], and its characteristics greatly contributed to the high completion rates. This study produced exciting outcomes since it enabled the identification of essential components critical for developing this pedagogical strategy. This approach holds promise in ensuring the safety and quality of care while aligning with healthcare professionals’ expectations and demands.

Abstract: The communication of Wildfire knowledge on the web is extensive, with numerous sources distributing information on the topic. However, most of the content available targets specialists, researchers, and stakeholders, failing to engage wider non-specialized audiences. Integrated into the FIRE-RES Project, our goal is twofold: 1) understand how Multimedia Interactive Technologies can improve engagement and make Fire Knowledge more accessible and intuitive, and 2) create a Fire Information Platform that aggregates information on Fire resilience. The research methodology is divided into two phases. The first is focused on understanding the research context and target audience and uses a mix of traditional and user-centered research methods: Literature Review on Risk and Science Communication on the web and possibilities of Multimedia Technologies; UX Benchmarking of selected solutions; Online survey with the targeted audience, and 4) Collaborative Ideation session. The survey gathered 811 answers that revealed the general understanding, habits, and information sources regarding wildfire knowledge. In addition to that, we selected five web solutions and explored three multimedia features adopted to enhance information dissemination: gamification, interactivity, and narratives. These data informed the second phase, which involved an analysis of the preliminary results and the design of high-fidelity prototypes. These were later subjected to usability testing with a few relevant personas. Ultimately, the study reveals the potential of Digital Technologies in Science Communication and demonstrates that adopting a user-centered approach facilitates content adaptation to users and increases engagement, accessibility, and knowledge retention. By making essential fire information more intuitive and engaging for different audiences, we expect to contribute to wildfire prevention in Portugal and abroad.

Abstract: Organizational improvement relies heavily on having a competent workforce. To facilitate continuous improvement in the construction industry, this study examined the weaknesses in problem-solving skills among today's students (the future workforce). Based on these findings, a new educational approach was proposed, taking today’s student characteristics such as Acquired Attention Deficit Disorder (AADD) into consideration. This proposed educational approach was proved to have immediate and lasting effects beyond class periods on students’ learning through improved thinking skill exercises. Initial investigations focused on identifying weaknesses in exercising adequate thinking skills in problem-solving and determining the cause beyond the weaknesses. Weaknesses were identified when faced with information processing, locating inputs from multiple sources, repeating the same cognitive processes over extended periods, unfamiliar calculation direction, and ignoring industry common sense due to a calculation-oriented mindset. The lack of fundamentals was identified as the primary cause of the weakness. To resolve the weaknesses by addressing the cause behind the weaknesses, a new educational approach was proposed and validated through a mixed method. First, a feedback framework was designed which functions for knowledge delivery. Feedback was designed to deliver highly relevant knowledge to the problem at hand and to be presented in a size to allow easy information consumption in real-time considering the target students’ characteristics and learning preferences, Generation Z. Feedback, a knowledge delivery tool, had immediate effects on exercising thinking skills in problem-solving on a sample of 13 graduate-level students in the Department of Construction Science at Texas A&M University who volunteered for the experiment and the following interview. Especially, two factors of feedback were counted as the key to improving thinking skills, and they are the feedback that was given immediately in real-time when it was in need (when in need) and the feedback that matched the target knowledge in question (what is needed). The design feedback also had a lasting impact on exercising adequate thinking skills, by which improved academic achievement was demonstrated in a sample of 24 students enrolled in a construction estimating course for undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University. The result of the paired t-test evidenced the effectiveness of feedback on knowledge retention and academic achievement. Additionally, 71% of 24 study participants responded to the self-confidence survey, and the positive self-confidence in exercising thinking skills in each category in Bloom’s Taxonomy also denoted the efficacy of knowledge feeding in feedback. This study theoretically expanded types of feedback by adding knowledge delivery to the existing feedback types. With this addition, feedback now functions not only giving confirmation or correction for the performance, but it also functions as a vehicle for knowledge delivery. Pragmatically, this study proposed a novel educational approach which aligns with today’s students’ learning preferences and weaknesses.

Abstract: O avanço tecnológico, impulsionado pela globalização, transformou o cenário educacional, adaptando-o às novas relações sociais e possibilitando um maior acesso aos alunos. No Brasil, a educação a distância (EAD) teve um aumento expressivo, com um crescimento de 474% em dez anos, segundo dados do Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (Brasil, 2022). Esse crescimento pode ser atribuído, entre outros, ao contexto tecnológico da sociedade atual, em que os ‘nativos digitais’ têm acesso precoce e familiaridade com as tecnologias digitais (Prensky, 2010). Os nativos digitais interagem constantemente com as Tecnologias Digitais de Informação e Comunicação, influenciando suas experiências em acessar, distribuir, criar e interagir com informações. Contudo, a ascensão dessa sociedade acostumada a múltiplos estímulos apresenta desafios para a educação, especialmente no EAD. Pesquisas mostram que vídeos breves no YouTube , com menos de quatro minutos, recebem mais visualizações e maior interação do que vídeos mais longos (Redondo et al., 2021). Esse comportamento de consumo afeta a educação, destacando a importância de novas abordagens pedagógicas. Nesse ambiente, o microlearning surge como uma abordagem suplementar que atende às demandas dos alunos modernos, envolvendo a entrega de microconteúdos que podem ser consumidos em até cinco minutos, resumindo conceitos essenciais de um curso ou disciplina específica (Torgerson; Iannone, 2020). Este estudo propõe investigar o microlearning como estratégia de aprendizagem no ensino superior, especialmente em cursos de pós-graduação lato sensu na modalidade EAD, com a pergunta: em que medida o microlearning pode ser relevante para a educação no contexto de cursos de pós-graduação EAD? Esta pesquisa faz parte do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Educação, Mestrado em Educação, da Universidade Regional de Blumenau (FURB), e está inserida na linha de pesquisa Linguagens, Arte e Educação. O objetivo geral é analisar potencialidades educativas do microlearning , por meio das impressões do corpo técnico-pedagógico de uma instituição de ensino superior de Santa Catarina. Os objetivos específicos são: (I) aplicar uma proposta de implantação do microlearning para uma formação com o corpo técnico-pedagógico da instituição; (II) identificar elementos significativos do microlearning no processo de aprendizagem; (III) refletir sobre a utilização do microlearning na educação. O estudo adota uma abordagem qualitativa (Flick, 2009) e caracteriza-se como pesquisa-ação (Thiollent, 2011). A metodologia foi implementada em um curso com o corpo técnico de uma IES, dividindo o contingente em dois grupos. O grupo de controle fez o curso sem acesso ao microlearning , enquanto o grupo experimental teve acesso aos materiais de microlearning via e-mail . Para este grupo, formou-se um grupo de interlocução de sete colaboradores, entrevistados para identificar o impacto do microlearning na aprendizagem. A coleta de dados foi realizada por meio de questionários e entrevistas, analisados com base no referencial teórico de Bardin (2016). Os resultados apontam uma contribuição significativa do microlearning no aumento do engajamento, melhora na retenção do conhecimento e um ganho substancial no desempenho acadêmico entre os participantes do grupo experimental, os quais apresentaram uma taxa de conclusão superior em comparação ao grupo de controle. Alternate abstract: The advancement of technology, driven by globalization, has transformed the educational landscape, adapting it to new social relations and enabling greater access to students. In Brazil, distance education (DE) has seen a significant increase, with a growth of 474% over ten years, according to data from the National Institute for Educational Studies and Research Anísio Teixeira (Brazil, 2022). This growth may be attributed to the technological context of today’s society, in which 'digital natives' have early access and familiarity with digital technologies (Prensky, 2010). Digital natives constantly interact with Digital Information and Communication Technologies, influencing their experiences in accessing, distributing, creating, and interacting with information. However, the rise of this stimulus-rich society poses challenges for education, especially in DE. Research shows that brief YouTube videos, under four minutes, receive more views and greater engagement than longer videos (Redondo et al., 2021). This consumption behavior impacts education, highlighting the importance of new pedagogical approaches. In this environment, microlearning emerges as a supplemental approach that meets the demands of modern students, involving the delivery of microcontent that can be consumed in up to five minutes, summarizing essential concepts of a course or specific subject (Torgerson and Iannone, 2020). This study proposes investigating microlearning as a learning strategy in higher education, particularly in lato sensu graduate courses in DE, with the question: to what extent can microlearning be relevant to education in the context of DE graduate courses? This research study is part of the Graduate Program in Education, Master’s in Education, at the Regional University of Blumenau (FURB), and is aligned with the research field of Languages, Art, and Education. The general objective is to analyze the educational potential of microlearning through the perspectives of the technicalpedagogical staff of a higher education institution in Santa Catarina. The specific objectives are: (I) to apply a microlearning implementation proposal for training with the institution's technical-pedagogical staff; (II) to identify significant elements of microlearning in the learning process; (III) to reflect on the use of microlearning in education. The study adopts a qualitative approach (Flick, 2009) and is characterized as action research (Thiollent, 2011). The methodology was implemented in a course with the technical staff of a Higher Education Institution, dividing the contingent into two groups. The control group took the course without access to microlearning, while the experimental group had access to microlearning materials via email. For this group, an interlocution group of seven collaborators was formed and interviewed to identify the impact of microlearning on learning. Data collection was conducted through questionnaires and interviews, analyzed based on Bardin’s theoretical framework (2016). The results indicate a significant contribution of microlearning in increasing engagement, improving knowledge retention, and a substantial gain in academic performance among the experimental group participants, who showed a higher completion rate compared to the control group. It was evident that segmenting content into microcontent contributed to learning that is more aligned to the needs of contemporary students, demonstrating the potential of microlearning as a relevant complementary methodology for DE in graduate courses.

Abstract: No século XIX, a Revolução Industrial chegou a Portugal, trazendo consigo mudanças significativas no estilo de vida do país. A população, que vivia principalmente da agricultura, passou a concentrar-se nas cidades em busca de melhores oportunidades de emprego, num processo de migração que foi incentivado pelo foco e investimento nas áreas urbanas do litoral, que se traduziu no abandono de muitas comunidades rurais. O abandono de inúmeros lares resultou na deterioração de muitas construções no espaço rural, porém, esta transformação do território não resultou apenas no abandono de lares, como também na perda de saberes, de costumes, de tradições e, principalmente, da identidade de muitos lugares. Estes efeitos fizeram-se sentir sobretudo nas regiões do interior, sendo o maciço de Sicó o território de ação da presente dissertação e que, apesar dos desafios demográficos, possui forças intrínsecas, diretamente ligadas à sua paisagem natural, histórica e cultural que podem alavancar o seu desenvolvimento. Com o objetivo de reverter este cenário desafiante e de promover o reforço da atratividade deste território, foi criada a iniciativa “De volta ao rural ou como reforçar a coesão da cidade regional?”, no âmbito de um protocolo entre a Terras de Sicó e a Universidade de Coimbra, através do Departamento de Arquitetura. Neste contexto, são propostas estratégias de intervenção para as aldeias que integram a Rede de Aldeias de Calcário (RAC), tendo em vista superar as suas fragilidades e destacar as suas forças. O presente trabalho tem como especial foco a aldeia da Granja, visando impulsionar o seu desenvolvimento e reforçar a sua atratividade para a fixação de novas atividades e pessoas. Estes objetivos concretizam-se num conjunto de construções, nomeadamente um Complexo Cohousing, uma Casa de Eira, uma Pensão, um Lagar e uma Loja de Produtos Locais, que exemplificam boas práticas de intervenção num meio recheado de patrimónios bastante particulares, que merecem ser preservados e valorizados. Assim, a estratégia Viver na Granja prevê revitalizar a vida comunitária e ainda criar novas oportunidades económicas e sociais na aldeia, resgatando a sua identidade e fortalecendo os laços entre a comunidade. Alternate abstract: In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution reached Portugal, bringing significant changes to the country's way of life. The population, which primarily relied on agriculture, began to concentrate in cities in search of better job opportunities, in a migration process incentivized by the focus and investment in the coastal urban areas, leading to the abandonment of many rural communities. The abandonment of numerous homes resulted in the deterioration of many constructions in rural areas. However, this transformation of the territory not only led to the abandonment of homes but also to the loss of knowledge, customs, traditions, and, primarily, the identity of many places. These effects were particularly felt in the interior regions, with the Sicó Massif being the territory of action of the present dissertation, which, despite demographic challenges, possesses intrinsic strengths directly linked to its natural, historical, and cultural landscape that can drive its development forward. With the aim of reversing this challenging scenario and promoting the reinforcement of the attractiveness of this territory, the initiative De volta ao rural ou como reforçar a coesão da cidade regional? was created within a protocol between Terras de Sicó and the University of Coimbra, through the Department of Architecture. In this context, intervention strategies are proposed for the villages that are part of the Rede de Aldeias de Calcário (RAC), aiming to overcome their weaknesses and highlight their strengths. The present work has a special focus on the village of Granja, aiming to boost its development and reinforce its attractiveness for attracting new activities and people. These objectives materialize in a set of constructions, namely a Cohousing Complex, a Casa de Eira, a Guesthouse, an Oil Press, and a Local Products Shop, which exemplify good intervention practices in an environment filled with particularly unique heritage sites that deserve preservation and valorization. Therefore, the Viver na Granja strategy aims to revitalize community life and create new economic and social opportunities in the village, rescuing its identity and strengthening community ties.

Abstract: Motivation shapes the actions of individuals, serving as a driving force behind behavior and decision-making. In education, motivation significantly impacts academic achievement, persistence, engagement, and emotional well-being. Motivated students are more likely to set high academic goals, persist despite challenges, and engage deeply in classroom activities, leading to better knowledge retention and satisfaction. Additionally, motivation fosters self-regulated learning strategies, essential for lifelong learning and adapting to new challenges. This Master’s thesis investigates the relationship between students' dominant academic motivation type and their level of career decidedness, grounded in Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985). According to this theory, intrinsic motivation, associated with autonomy, is fundamental to personal self-regulation and effective behavior, showing strong associations with academic motivation and potentially, career clarity. A sample of 458 students from the University of Coimbra, encompassing diverse faculties (STEM, Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences), study cycles, age groups, and genders, was utilized to explore this relationship. The study employed a quantitative methodology, using validated questionnaires to assess academic motivation (Academic Motivation Scale by Vallerand, 1992) and career decidedness (Career Decision Scale by Osipow, 1976). The findings reveal that participants exhibited below-average levels of most types of academic motivation, while the general level of career decidedness among students was above average. Gender differences indicated that female students had slightly higher levels of Extrinsic Motivation - Introjected Regulation compared to male students. Students identifying as a gender “other” than male or female reported higher demotivation, although there were no significant differences in demotivation based on gender overall. Age-related differences showed that younger students (aged 18-25) exhibited lower intrinsic motivation and higher extrinsic motivation, while older students demonstrated the opposite dynamics, with no significant differences in demotivation based on age. Regarding study cycles, Master's and Doctorate level students exhibited higher intrinsic motivation compared to Bachelor's students. Additionally, Bachelor's and Doctorate students exhibited higher levels of demotivation compared to Master's students. In terms of the field of study, intrinsic motivation was higher among students in the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) compared to those in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). STEM students demonstrated higher levels of extrinsic motivation and demotivation compared to HASS students. Finally, the research found no significant correlation between academic motivation types and career decidedness, raising questions for further investigation on the applicability of Self-Determination Theory in the field of education. This study's findings hold potential for practical applications aimed at improving academic methodologies in higher education institutions, thereby fostering positive career outcomes for students. Alternate abstract: A motivação molda as ações dos indivíduos, servindo como uma força motriz por trás do comportamento e da tomada de decisões. Na educação, a motivação impacta significativamente o desempenho académico, a persistência, o envolvimento e o bem-estar emocional. Alunos motivados são mais propensos a estabelecer metas académicas elevadas, persistir apesar dos desafios e envolver-se profundamente nas atividades em sala de aula, levando a uma melhor retenção do conhecimento e satisfação. Além disso, a motivação promove estratégias de aprendizagem autorregulada, essenciais para a aprendizagem ao longo da vida e adaptação a novos desafios. Esta tese de Mestrado investiga a relação entre o tipo dominante de motivação académica dos alunos e o seu nível de decisão de carreira, fundamentada na Teoria da Autodeterminação (Deci & Ryan, 1985). De acordo com esta teoria, a motivação intrínseca, associada à autonomia, é fundamental para a autorregulação pessoal e comportamento eficaz, mostrando fortes associações com a motivação académica e, potencialmente, com a clareza de carreira. Uma amostra de 458 alunos da Universidade de Coimbra, abrangendo diversas faculdades (STEM, Artes e Humanidades, Ciências Sociais), ciclos de estudo, faixas etárias e géneros, foi utilizada para explorar esta relação. O estudo empregou uma metodologia quantitativa, utilizando questionários validados para avaliar a motivação académica (Escala de Motivação Académica de Vallerand, 1992) e a decisão de carreira (Escala de Decisão de Carreira de Osipow, 1976). Os resultados revelam que os participantes exibiram níveis abaixo da média na maioria dos tipos de motivação académica, enquanto o nível geral de decisão de carreira entre os alunos foi acima da média. Diferenças de género indicaram que as alunas apresentaram níveis ligeiramente mais altos de Motivação Extrínseca - Regulação Introjetada em comparação com os alunos. Alunos que se identificam com um género “diferente” de masculino ou feminino relataram maior desmotivação, embora não tenham sido encontradas diferenças significativas na desmotivação com base no género em geral. Diferenças relacionadas à idade mostraram que os alunos mais jovens (com idades entre 18-25 anos) exibiram menor motivação intrínseca e maior motivação extrínseca, enquanto os alunos mais velhos demonstraram a dinâmica oposta, sem diferenças significativas na desmotivação com base na idade. Em relação aos ciclos de estudo, os alunos de Mestrado e Doutoramento exibiram maior motivação intrínseca em comparação com os alunos de Licenciatura. Além disso, os alunos de Licenciatura e Doutoramento exibiram níveis mais altos de desmotivação em comparação com os alunos de Mestrado. Em termos de área de estudo, a motivação intrínseca foi maior entre os alunos de Humanidades, Artes e Ciências Sociais (HASS) em comparação com aqueles de Ciência, Tecnologia, Engenharia e Matemática (STEM). Os alunos de STEM demonstraram níveis mais altos de motivação extrínseca e desmotivação em comparação com os alunos de HASS. Finalmente, a pesquisa não encontrou correlação significativa entre os tipos de motivação académica e a decisão de carreira, levantando questões para investigação futura sobre a aplicabilidade da Teoria da Autodeterminação no campo da educação. As descobertas deste estudo têm potencial para aplicações práticas voltadas para a melhoria das metodologias académicas em instituições de ensino superior, promovendo assim resultados de carreira positivos para os alunos.

Abstract: Le but principal de cette recherche est d'explorer l'impact de la méthode d'apprentissage coopératif (A.C.) dans le processus d'acquisition de la compétence de l'oral en français des futurs enseignants de français langue étrangère (désormais FLE). Partant de l'idée que malgré la maitrise souvent parfaite des connaissances grammaticales et celle du vocabulaire nécessaire, en matière de l'amélioration et du perfectionnement, la difficulté de compréhension et d'expression dans la langue cible reste intacte chez la plupart des apprenants, les questions suivantes sont traitées à travers la pratique de la méthode d'apprentissage coopérative : 1) Comment une communication/interaction efficace se déroule-t-elle en classe de langue ? 2) Y a-t-il une différence significative dans l'acquisition de la compétence de l'oral entre le groupe expérimental dans lequel la méthode coopérative est pratiquée et le groupe témoin ? Les résultats de cette recherche démontrent que la méthode d'apprentissage coopératif contribue de manière significative au développement des compétences orales des futurs enseignants de FLE, notamment en renforçant l'interaction entre étudiants et la rétention des connaissances. Ces résultats soulignent également l' importance d'intégrer cette approche dans les pratiques pédagogiques afin d'optimiser les processus d'apprentissage linguistique.

Bu fikirden hareketle, işbirlikli öǧrenme yönteminin uygulanması yoluyla aşaǧıdaki sorulara cevap arayacaǧız : 1) Dil sınıfında etkili iletişim ve etkileşim nasıl saǧlanır ? 2) İşbirlikli yöntemin uygulandıǧı deney grubu ile kontrol grubu arasında sözlü yeterlik ediniminde anlamlı bir fark var mıdır ? Bu araştırmanın sonuçları, iş birliǧine dayalı öǧrenme yönteminin, Fransızcanın yabancı dil olarak öǧretimi alanındaki öǧretmen adaylarının sözlü becerilerini geliştirmede önemli bir katkı saǧladıǧını, özellikle de öǧrenci etkileşimini güçlendirdiǧini ve bilgilerin kalıcılıǧını artırdıǧını göstermektedir. Ayrıca, bu bulgular, dil öǧrenme süreçlerini daha verimli hale getirmek için bu yaklaşımın eǧitim uygulamalarına dâhil edilmesinin önemini vurgulamaktadır Alternate abstract: The main goal of this research is to explore the impact of the cooperative learning method (C.L.) in the acquisition of oral skills in non-native French as foreign language teacher's candidates. It is well known that in the process of acquisition, although the grammar rules of the target language are acquired and sufficient vocabulary baggage is established, there are still communication problems due to the difficulty of perfecting comprehension and speaking skills in the target language. Thus, in order to compensate for this difficulty by the C.L. method, in our study, we will try to answer the following questions: 1) How does an effective communication/ interaction work take place in the language classroom? Is there a significant difference in the acquisition of oral proficiency between the experimental group in which the cooperative method is applied and the control group? The results of this research show that the cooperative learning method makes a significant contribution to the development of the oral skills of future teachers of French as a foreign language, particularly by enhancing student interaction and knowledge retention. These results also underline the importance of integrating this approach into teaching practices in order to optimize language learning processes.

Abstract: Audience and Type of Curriculum: This is a review curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to enhance the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers (nurses and physicians). Length of Curriculum: 8-10 hours Introduction: Early recognition and stabilization of critical pediatric patients can improve outcomes. Compared with resource-rich systems, many low-resource settings (i.e., LMICs) rely on generalists to provide most pediatric acute care. We created a curriculum for general practitioners comprising multiple educational modules focused on identifying and stabilizing pediatric emergencies. Our aim was to develop an educational framework to update and teach generalists on the recommendations and techniques of optimally evaluating and managing pediatric nutritional and gastrointestinal emergencies: bowel obstructions, gastroenteritis, and malnutrition. Educational Goals: The aim of this curriculum is to increase learners’ proficiency in identifying and stabilizing acutely ill pediatric patients with gastrointestinal medical or surgical disease or complications of malnutrition. This module focuses on the diagnosis and management of gastroenteritis, acute bowel obstruction, and deficiencies of feeding and nutrition. The target audience for this curriculum is generalist physicians and nurses in limited-resource settings. Educational Methods: The educational strategies used in this curriculum include didactic lectures, medical simulation, and small-group sessions. Research Methods: We evaluated written pretests before and posttests after intervention and retested participants four months later to evaluate for knowledge retention. Participants provided qualitative feedback on the module. Results: We taught 21 providers. Eleven providers completed the pretest/posttest and eight completed the retest. The mean test scores improved from 8.3 ± 1.7 in the pretest to 12.2 ± 2.6 in the posttest (mean difference: 1.4,

Abstract: Audience: The target audience for this small group workshop are interns and residents of any specialty. Introduction: All residents are expected to become proficient teachers in a variety of settings as they progress in training, and many residency programs offer advanced training or credentialing in medical education.1,2 Recently, some emergency medicine programs have also begun to offer a formal medical education fellowship. Traditional resident education has been in the form of didactic lectures such as morning report, noon conference, and Grand Rounds as well as small group bedside teaching by attendings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in many cases these learning structures have been reengineered into a hybrid or virtual model.3 This new educational paradigm has spurred the search for best practice teaching methods across a variety of situations. 4 Active teaching, characterized by audience engagement and self-directed learning, has been shown to promote deeper understanding and improved knowledge retention when compared to standard didactic teaching.5,6 Educational curricula for residents now acknowledge the importance of audience participation, with more emphasis on the use of interactive teaching techniques. A review of residents-as-teachers curricula highlighted the importance of disseminating practical resources for how to effectively teach residents to be better educators.7 However, in the literature there are few examples of how to teach residents to implement these best practice interactive teaching methods. We designed a simple, interactive, and easily reproducible workshop for introducing the concepts of active teaching to residents that allows for active engagement with these techniques. Educational Objectives: By the end of this small group exercise, learners will be able to: 1) assess interactive teaching techniques that support learning in various environments; 2) incorporate active teaching techniques into a variety of real-world teaching scenarios; 3) implement selected techniques to enrich one’s own teaching practice. Educational Methods: Our workshop was designed to include elements of gamification, which facilitates teamwork and competition and can be used to engage learners in higher levels of learning.8 We began by performing a literature search for descriptions of active teaching techniques that had been used in the medical setting.9-14 We developed a list of 15 popular active teaching strategies and created a one-page menu which briefly described each strategy. Utilizing the flipped classroom model, we identified three articles (references 10, 11, and 14) which reviewed active teaching techniques and sent these articles to our participants via email one week before our session with instructions to read the articles and come prepared to discuss them at our session. We created two sets of playing cards for our activity. The first set of playing cards was titled “teaching setting” and included common venues for teaching in clinical medicine: morning report, grand rounds warm-up (which at our institution consists of a 15-minute lecture given to a large audience in a formal setting), small group, bedside teaching, journal club, and an online/virtual lecture. The second set of playing cards included simulated audiences that could be present at a teaching session: peers (residents), medical students, attendings, or mixed audience. To account for larger groups of residents, we made multiple copies of each card within the respective card set. At the beginning of the workshop, the learning objectives were discussed and the menu with the 15 active teaching techniques was reviewed along with the assigned pre-reading articles. Residents were asked to name different active teaching techniques and give examples they experienced during their residency or medical school education. Participants (pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents) were then placed in groups of three or four, and each group drew one teaching setting card and one audience card. All groups were given the same general topic (diabetic ketoacidosis) and each group was challenged to design a short teaching activity relevant to the topic that incorporated active teaching techniques appropriate for their setting and audience. After a short period of planning, each group reported how they would teach the topic and which active teaching strategies they would use. After each group described their approach, they received peer feedback from the other groups’ participants. Key aspects of the proposed active teaching techniques and any barriers to implementation were discussed. The cards were then reshuffled for each group, and the exercise was repeated with a different general topic (in our session, we chose developmental milestones). Research Methods: Participants provided anonymous feedback in the form of surveys which assessed the efficacy of the workshop. Participants were also asked to commit to three active teaching techniques they would incorporate into teaching sessions within the next six months. Results: Our workshop was presented for two sequential years: 2022 and 2023. Our workshop was attended by 32 residents in year one and 36 residents in year two. All participants filled out the anonymous evaluation survey at the conclusion of the exercise. Eighty-five percent of respondents rated the session as “highly organized,” and a majority strongly agreed that the workshop was effective for learning active teaching techniques (78%) and taught them concrete techniques that they could incorporate into their future teaching (88%). Participants reported that they were most likely to utilize Jigsaw (31 respondents), Polling/audience response (29 respondents), case-based learning (25 respondents), role play (24 respondents) and small group activities (20 respondents) into their next teaching session. In our second workshop, there were 19 participants who had also attended the first workshop. All 19 of these residents reported using at least one active teaching technique during the previous year, and over half reported using at least three of the techniques. Discussion: Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with the organization and efficacy of this workshop. The strategies of using sets of cards to randomize the process, adding time constraints, and having each group report their teaching plans increased overall participant interest and excitement in the workshop. Having all groups design teaching sessions using the same general topic was chosen intentionally to promote friendly competition and to allow for discussion among the groups about similarities and differences in the application of their chosen active teaching techniques. To apply our activity to other specialties, we recommend choosing general topics that are commonly encountered in that specialty; for example, the topic of “myocardial infarction” or “pediatric toxidromes” could be used for emergency medicine residents.

Abstract: Culture is a cornerstone of identity, yet many cultures face the risk of fading into obscurity despite efforts to preserve them through various mediums. Leveraging the concept of 3D serious games and basing the research on key learning theories like the maker pedagogy and multiliteracies theory, this research aims to educate children about culture by developing a 3D game maker tool that implements key elements of the researched learning theories. The goal is to empower users aged 12 and older to effortlessly create serious 3D cultural games in a first-person view, enriching the experience with IoT and AI features. Additionally, the tool facilitates gameplay of games crafted using the same platform, fostering social interaction and aligning with effective forms of learning. Methodologically, an iterative design process was employed, starting with the creation of initial prototypes and interviews to discern optimal features and design principles. The tool was refined based on insights gathered from existing literature on serious game design guidelines, prioritizing user-friendly accessibility, and ensuring the learning theories are properly implemented. In the final trial, participants engaged in crafting 3D serious games using the tool, juxtaposed against a control group utilizing a conventional 2D storyboarding tool. Subsequently, participants immersed themselves in a serious game experience exploring Kristang culture, with learning gain, memory, and knowledge retention meticulously evaluated. Despite its focus on Kristang culture, the tool's adaptable nature suggests its potential applicability to diverse cultural contexts. Findings indicate that the tool improved user experience and learning outcomes for Kristang cultural heritage education compared to control methods. However, limitations such as a small sample size and system constraints were encountered. Research implications delve into the potential of the 3D serious game maker tool as an effective educational tool for children to learn about culture, contributing to the broader understanding of utilizing innovative technology for cultural education among younger demographics. Moreover, design guidelines established in the study lay a foundation for future research endeavors seeking to develop effective educational tools with a significant impact on learning outcomes. Practically, integrating the tool into classroom settings holds promise for fostering immersive and interactive cultural education experiences, augmenting traditional instruction, and facilitating collaborative learning. This research introduces an innovative educational tool that combines elements of the maker movement with experiential learning paradigms, addressing the gap of lack in 3D cultural maker educational tools that combine learning theories into their framework. This research aims to implement those learning theories into an engaging 3D game maker tool specifically for the Kristang culture. In conclusion, the development of this innovative 3D serious game maker tool represents a significant stride towards cultural education for younger generations. Embracing the opportunities presented by this tool can pave the way for more inclusive and dynamic approaches to cultural learning, empowering children to explore, create, and celebrate diverse cultural narratives in a digital age.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 4th International Conference on Digital Society and Intelligent Systems (DSInS) Conference Start Date: 2024 Nov. 20 Conference End Date: 2024 Nov. 22 Conference Location: Sydney, Australia Knowledge tracing is fundamental to intelligent educational systems, as it predicts future learning outcomes by analyzing learners' historical performance related to specific knowledge concepts. While advancements have been made through deep learning techniques in the knowledge tracing domain, traditional research faces two significant limitations: insufficient consideration of temporal factors, which impacts the accurate depiction of knowledge retention and mastery dynamics; and the assumption of a one-to-one correspondence between practice and a single knowledge concept, disregarding the complexity of coexisting multiple knowledge concepts. To address these issues, this paper proposes the MulTKT model, which integrates response intervals, response durations, and the synergistic effects of multiple knowledge concepts, while incorporating a temporal decay factor into the self-attention mechanism to precisely capture learning dynamics. Experimental results indicate that MulTKT more accurately represents knowledge states and predicts student performance.

Abstract: Portugal, assim como os restantes países europeus, tem enfrentado o envelhecimento da população ativa, apresentando uma das populações mais envelhecidas da Europa (Faria, 2023). A atual conjuntura apresenta desafios significativos para a empresa Águas do Alto Minho, especialmente, no que diz respeito ao envelhecimento da sua força de trabalho operacional (Sandelin et al., 2019), e ao aumento do número de trabalhadores que caminham para a reforma, os quais detêm um ativo valioso – o conhecimento (Sokoh & Okolie, 2021). O principal objetivo deste relatório de estágio é explorar a gestão do conhecimento numa empresa de serviços públicos portuguesa, com ênfase específica na dinâmica da retenção e partilha de conhecimento dos trabalhadores seniores, no contexto das tarefas operacionais diárias. Mediante uma abordagem qualitativa, foram realizadas entrevistas semiestruturadas ao Diretor de Exploração, à Diretora Administrativa Financeira, à Técnica Superior de Recursos Humanos, à Técnica de Recursos Humanos, aos responsáveis pelos Centros Operacionais e a 18 técnicos operativos de operação (representando 25% da equipa operacional) em 2023. Com base na literatura e nos elementos recolhidos é concebido um projeto estruturado de retenção e transferência de conhecimento sénior com o objetivo de abordar uma gestão de conhecimento capaz de assegurar que o conhecimento criado e partilhado seja integrado, aplicado e gerido através de práticas de Recursos Humanos (Singh et al., 2021). Alternate abstract: Portugal, like other European countries, has faced the aging of the active population, with one of the oldest populations in Europe (Faria, 2023). The current situation presents significant challenges for the company Águas do Alto Minho, especially with regard to the aging of its operational workforce (Sandelin et al., 2019), and the increase in the number of workers heading towards retirement, who hold a valuable asset – knowledge (Sokoh & Okolie, 2021). The main objective of this internship report is to explore knowledge management in a Portuguese utility company, with a specific emphasis on the dynamics of retention and knowledge sharing of senior workers, in the context of daily operational tasks. Through a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the Director of Operations, the Financial Administrative Director, the Senior Human Resources Technician, the Human Resources Technician, four Operational Center Managers and 18 operational operation technicians (representing 25% of the operational team) in 2023. Based on the literature and the elements collected, a structured senior knowledge retention and transfer project is designed with the aim of addressing knowledge management capable of ensuring that the knowledge created and shared is integrated, applied, and managed through Human Resources practices (Singh et al., 2021).

Abstract: Today’s digital landscape emphasizes the significance of preparing students and professionals to be skilled network administrators, with the ability to manage and troubleshoot complex infrastructures successfully. It is critical to train students in advanced network administration abilities in a pedagogical environment that promotes knowledge retention and successful learning. Traditional methods of network testing, which involve multiple physical devices, are expensive and difficult to scale. Emulation technologies provide a solution that allows multiple virtual devices to run on the same machine. Despite these advances, evaluating network device configurations remains labor-intensive and subject to human error, with configuration updates frequently resulting in critical network errors. This dissertation addresses these challenges by taking the first steps toward creating a prototype of an automated assessment tool with multi-platform device compatibility. The solution seeks to simplify assessment creation and evaluation, improve scalability, and provide important features such as immediate feedback, thereby improving the learning experience. One of the primary objectives is to automate most of the laborious tasks, thereby reducing the number of manual procedures. An automated network system can be used in both educational and business environments, making it easy to test users’ knowledge. The prototype development was accompanied by guided and argued practical testing. The approach taken led to the development of the prototype within the Proxmox Virtual Environment, as well as the use of the Graphical Network Simulator 3 to create the assessments using its emulated devices. The automated evaluation process was developed using the Nornir automation tool, which is based on Python modules and simplifies the extraction of GNS3 device configuration for verification. Alternate abstract: O cenário digital atual enfatiza a importância de preparar estudantes e profissionais para serem administradores de rede qualificados, com capacidade de gerir e solucionar problemas de infraestruturas complexas com sucesso. É fundamental treinar os alunos em habilidades avançadas de administração de redes em um ambiente pedagógico que promova a retenção de conhecimento e uma aprendizagem bem-sucedida. Os métodos tradicionais de teste de rede, que envolvem vários dispositivos físicos, são caros e difíceis de escalar. As tecnologias de emulação fornecem uma solução que permite que vários dispositivos virtuais sejam executados na mesma máquina. Apesar desses avanços, a avaliação das configurações dos dispositivos de rede continua trabalhosa e sujeita a erros humanos, com atualizações de configuração frequentemente resultando em erros críticos de rede. Esta dissertação aborda estes desafios dando os primeiros passos para a criação de um protótipo de uma ferramenta de avaliação automatizada com compatibilidade de dispositivos multiplataforma. A solução busca simplificar a criação e avaliação de avaliações, melhorar a escalabilidade e fornecer recursos importantes, como feedback imediato, melhorando assim a experiência de aprendizagem. Um dos objetivos principais é automatizar a maioria das tarefas trabalhosas, reduzindo assim o número de procedimentos manuais. Um sistema de rede automatizado pode ser usado tanto em ambientes educacionais quanto empresariais, facilitando o teste de conhecimento dos usuários. O desenvolvimento do protótipo foi acompanhado de testes práticos orientados e argumentados. A abordagem adotada levou ao desenvolvimento do protótipo dentro do Ambiente Virtual Proxmox, bem como à utilização do Graphical Network Simulator 3 para criação das avaliações utilizando seus dispositivos emulados. O processo de avaliação automatizada foi desenvolvido utilizando a ferramenta de automação Nornir, que é baseada em módulos Python e simplifica a extração da configuração do dispositivo GNS3 para verificação.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of gamification on South African consumers attitudes and understanding of cybercrime. Given the increasing reliance on the Internet activities such as social media, digital banking, and e-commerce, there is a critical need for consumers to adopt basic security measures to protect themselves against threats such as privacy breaches, identity theft, cyberbullying, and exposure to harmful content. However, many individuals lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to ensure their online security. The research explores the challenges associated with enhancing security awareness and assesses the potential of gamification techniques to overcome these obstacles. By integrating game mechanics and elements into online security awareness activities, the study aims to make learning about cybersecurity engaging and enjoyable, leading to better understanding and adoption of safe online practices. The findings indicate that gamification significantly enhances consumer engagement, knowledge retention, and proactive cybersecurity behaviours. Additionally, the research contributes to the theoretical framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and behavioural science by providing empirical evidence that intrinsic motivation, fostered through gamification, enhances learning outcomes and behaviour change in cybercrime education. These insights offer valuable implications for businesses and organisations seeking to improve their cybersecurity training and consumer awareness campaigns. Ultimately, this research highlights gamification’s potential to transform cybersecurity education and to promote a more cyber-aware and proactive consumer base in South Africa.

Abstract: To assess the efficacy of a low-cost haemorrhage-control task simulator integrated in a high-fidelity simulation scenario to facilitate knowledge and practical skills acquisition, as well as self-efficacy in haemorrhage control among nursing students. Aim To assess the efficacy of a low-cost haemorrhage-control task simulator integrated in a high-fidelity simulation scenario to facilitate knowledge and practical skills acquisition, as well as self-efficacy in haemorrhage control among nursing students.A quasiexperimental before-after design was conducted at the University of Almeria. Design A quasiexperimental before-after design was conducted at the University of Almeria.A one-group preintervention, immediate postintervention, and a third assessment at three months were performed, with the Stop the Bleed Education Assessment Tool used to evaluate knowledge of haemorrhage control, as well as a 5-point Likert scale used to evaluate perceived self-efficacy. The success of controlling exsanguinating bleeding was determined by quantifying the millilitres lost during the intervention and calculating the time required to control the haemorrhaging. The data were reported using the TREND guidelines. Methods A one-group preintervention, immediate postintervention, and a third assessment at three months were performed, with the Stop the Bleed Education Assessment Tool used to evaluate knowledge of haemorrhage control, as well as a 5-point Likert scale used to evaluate perceived self-efficacy. The success of controlling exsanguinating bleeding was determined by quantifying the millilitres lost during the intervention and calculating the time required to control the haemorrhaging. The data were reported using the TREND guidelines.One hundred and three final-year nursing students participated in this study. Significant improvements ( p < 0.001) were observed in pre- and posttest total scores on knowledge of bleeding control, self-efficacy, as well as time is taken and volume loss to control the haemorrhage. Similar results were observed between preassessment and three months postassessment with significant improvements ( p < 0.001) in all measures. Results One hundred and three final-year nursing students participated in this study. Significant improvements (p < 0.001) were observed in pre- and posttest total scores on knowledge of bleeding control, self-efficacy, as well as time is taken and volume loss to control the haemorrhage. Similar results were observed between preassessment and three months postassessment with significant improvements (p < 0.001) in all measures.The use of a haemorrhage-control task simulator within a high-fidelity simulation scenario resulted in noteworthy improvements in nursing students' practical skills, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy. After three months, performance decreased but remained greater than pretraining levels. Thus, broadening the use of this task-training simulator would be of great value to further develop a first responder training approach with healthcare professionals and other laypersons, allowing for greater knowledge distribution and reaching a larger audience. Implications for Nursing Management . The findings underscore the potential efficacy of this simulator as a valuable resource for nursing educators and supervisors to train nursing students and professionals in terms of practical skills, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy in haemorrhage control, fostering a train-the-trainer cascade approach to reach a wider audience and enhance bleeding control proficiency among professionals.

Abstract: Background: The education of nursing students faces ongoing challenges in ensuring both high-quality learning and safe clinical practice. Traditional methods have been augmented by advanced simulation technologies, which enhance knowledge and skills in clinical settings. However, limitations such as high costs and space constraints persist. Clinical virtual simulation, an emerging approach, offers an interactive and immersive alternative that may address these challenges, but its impact on student satisfaction, self-efficacy, and knowledge retention remains unclear. Methods: This randomized controlled trial involved second-year nursing students (N=42) enrolled in a course on physiological responses. Participants were randomly assigned to either an experimental group using clinical virtual simulation or a control group using low-fidelity simulation. Assessments were conducted at three time points: pretest (A0), immediately post-intervention (A1), and two months later (A2). Knowledge retention, satisfaction, and self-efficacy were measured using tailored instruments. Data analysis included t-tests, MANOVA, and Cohen’s d for effect size. Results: Significant differences were found between the groups in knowledge retention and learning satisfaction. The experimental group showed superior outcomes in both immediate and long-term knowledge retention (P = .001, P = .02) and higher satisfaction levels (P < .001). MANOVA indicated significant time-related changes influenced by group allocation. No significant differences were observed in self-efficacy between groups (P = .9), although group differences were noted across assessments (P = .003). Conclusion: Clinical virtual simulation significantly enhances knowledge retention and student satisfaction in nursing education. While its impact on self-efficacy was less pronounced, the findings underscore the potential of virtual simulation to improve clinical competence and contribute to safer healthcare training.

Abstract: Background: Effective disaster management depends on the well-coordinated performance of teams within disaster medicine and emergency medical services (EMS). Mock drills serve as animportant cornerstone of training for these team members, yet their effectiveness in optimizing team performance remains an area of active investigation. Present narrative review examines the understanding of the applicability of mock drills to further enhance team performance in disaster medicine and EMS. Method:An extensive search of pertinent literature was carried out to identify studies investigating the application of mock drills in disaster preparedness training. The review examines the documented advantages, drawbacks, and prospective research areas for this training method. Results:Mock drills significantly enhance knowledge, communication, and problem-solving skills among disaster medicine and EMS team members. However, transforming these gains into sustained improvements in real-world scenario performance requires further exploration. Merging discussion-based and operation-based drills, customizing scenarios for EMS/paramedic difficulties, and integrating psychological stressors are promising approaches for optimizing drill design. Integrating insights from the learning sciences and conducting longitudinal research studies are necessary for maximizing knowledge retention and establishing the long-term impact of drills on real-world performance. Finally, the potential of virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and serious game-based platforms warrants further investigation for their ability to create immersive and dynamic training simulations. Conclusions: Mock drills offer animportant and variable tools for enhancing team performance in disaster medicine and EMS. By optimizing drill design, maximizing learning and retention, and embracing technological advancements, this training modality can be further refined to ensure optimal preparedness for the complexities of real-world disaster response.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 29 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 31 Conference Location: Kofu, Japan This study investigated the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) technology in enhancing fire safety training compared with traditional video-based methods. Conducted at a senior high school in Tanjungpinang, Indonesia, the study evaluated improvements in participants’ knowledge, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy. The AR-based training system used ARCore to create immersive and interactive fire simulation scenarios, while the video-based method provided a first-person perspective of the same procedures. The results indicated that AR-based training significantly improved knowledge retention, maintained higher levels of intrinsic motivation, and boosted self-efficacy more effectively than traditional video training. Participants also reported higher usability and a strong preference for AR-based training. These findings suggest integrating AR technology into fire safety training programs can enhance preparedness and response capabilities. However, further research is required to explore the long-term impacts and broader applicability of AR training in diverse settings. Overall, this study highlights the potential of AR for improving fire safety education and emergency preparedness.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE 4th International Conference on ICT in Business Industry & Government (ICTBIG) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 14 Conference Location: Indore, India Forecasting Stock market prices is ongoing research with researchers aspiring to develop models that supersede previous accuracy rates. Historically, statistical models like the GARCH and ARIMA models have been used for predictive analytics tasks, however, the volatility and complex nature of stock market data make it difficult to complete prediction tasks with such models. Various machine learning models like the Random Forest algorithm and Support Vector Machine have also been used for stock market prediction, at times achieving significant prediction accuracy in some tasks. However, this may not be sufficient. Of late researchers are experimenting with deep learning algorithms for stock market prediction with these remarkably improving accuracy rates. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of prominent stock price forecasting models to identify the best-performing model. By using a systematic review of the literature, we evaluate the top-performing models in terms of prediction accuracy, adaptability, and robustness. Results show that variations of the ensemble LSTM model outperform other models. Additionally, we observe that models with knowledge retention generally outperform traditional machine learning approaches in stock market prediction tasks.

Abstract: Introduction : Guatemalan lay midwives are well-respected community leaders in a country that lacks the institutional capacity to meet healthcare needs related to pregnancy, newborns, and COVID-19. Thus, Guatemalan lay midwives, who attend the majority of births in their country and who attend most births at home, are in an optimal position to offer frontline support to pregnant women and newborns regarding the global pandemic. The primary objective of this program of study was to dispel myths about COVID-19 and to provide culturally relevant educational activities to low-literacy Guatemalan lay midwives about issues related to the virus, such as signs and symptoms, risks to the mother and fetus, which patients are most vulnerable, appropriate responses, benefits and side-effects of the vaccine, timing of the vaccine, how the virus interacts with breastfeeding, and breastfeeding recommendations. Methods : In a partnership among the Guatemalan Ministry of Health, expert faculty at the University of Utah College of Nursing, and Madre y Niño, a non-profit organization from the US, evidence-based educational activities about COVID-19 were offered orally in the native language of participants. Two hundred and ten lay midwives attended educational sessions at 11 locations throughout the remote Peten department. Educational activities included repetition, storytelling, and role plays. A pretest–post-test evaluation of 10 questions with 24 correct answers was used to determine if the educational activities changed lay midwife knowledge about COVID-19. Participants were given essential birth supplies and laminated COVID Reminder Cards, which were designed to increase visual literacy, to encourage knowledge retention after the educational sessions. Results : Participants showed a significant increase in knowledge scores (possible 0–24) from prescores 7.09 (standard deviation (SD)=3.06) to 15.20 (SD=4.61), Student’s t-test p<0.001. In addition, a significantly higher proportion of participants mistakenly thought COVID-19 passed through breast milk on the pretest (70.1%) compared to post-test (8.4%) (McNemar test, p<0.001). Regarding breastfeeding, 12.6% of participants knew on the pretest that women with COVID-19 who breastfeed should wear a mask and wash their hands compared to 74.3% of participants who knew these recommendations on the post-test (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001). Finally, 2% of participants knew on the pretest that pregnant women with COVID-19 should take a low-dose aspirin compared to 67% of participants on the post-test (χ² (1)=194.7, p<0.001). Conclusion : These essential primary care providers misunderstood many critical issues related to COVID-19, pregnancy, and newborns. Culturally relevant educational activities provided orally in the native language of participants dispelled myths about the virus and significantly improved lay midwife knowledge. Providing evidence-based educational activities in a culturally relevant format is critical to protecting remote, vulnerable populations, such as pregnant Guatemalan women and newborns, during a global pandemic.

Abstract: The impact of breaks in direct instruction on knowledge retention among international K-12 students, focusing on teachers’ lived experiences, was explored in this study. The objective of this research study was to examine the challenges during instructional disruptions and identify strategies to maintain continuity and reduce knowledge loss. Understanding effective methods to manage extended breaks, particularly considering the widening achievement gap due to disruptions such as natural disasters and health crises such as COVID-19, was emphasized. A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to gather in-depth experiences from international teachers who live and work in South Carolina through semi-structured interviews. Nine teachers from diverse regions, including the Caribbean, Asia, South America, and Europe participated. Several key findings were uncovered from the interviews. These findings included disruptions in instruction significantly hinder continuity, leading to challenges in learning and retention. Strategies to manage disruptions included shifting to online platforms, frequent review sessions, and increased parental involvement. However, technological challenges such as limited access to devices and internet connectivity created barriers to seamless instruction, necessitating institutional support. Recommendations were presented for robust protocols, adaptable teaching methods, and strategic technology to support continuous learning during disruptions. Suggestions include training teachers in online instruction, implementing contingency plans, fostering greater parental engagement, and improving access to digital resources. Practical insights are presented for educators and policymakers to develop resilient educational practices that ensure inclusive and continuous learning, even during instructional breaks.

Abstract: The aim of this study resonated with the pursuit of achieving enhanced engagement in teaching and learning that informs critical thinking, and knowledge retention among students. Despite the growing trend of technological integration in teaching and learning, however, there exists a lack of empirical evidence and comprehensive studies that investigate the effectiveness of gaming in promoting educational objectives within rural institution of higher learning in South Africa. To investigate this gap, a systematic review method was employed, which provides a comprehensive and logical analysis of existing literature on the significance of gaming in teaching and learning within rural institutions of higher education. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used in the study to enhance the rigor and transparency of the research process, by providing a solid foundation for synthesizing and interpreting existing literature relevant to the study. The systematic review findings revealed that the significance of gamification in teaching and learning in rural higher education lies in its ability to overcome accessibility challenges, provide personalized learning experiences, address motivation and retention issues, and enhance digital literacy. It was recommended that by incorporating gamified approaches, rural higher educational institutions can create a more inclusive, engaging, and effective learning environment for students within the rural institutions of higher learning in South Africa.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new instructional toolkit for improving English grammar skills, particularly verb tense structures, among Thai EFL students. The research objectives were (1) to evaluate the toolkit's effectiveness in enhancing students' English grammar skills in verb tense structures; (2) to examine the impact on Thai EFL students' learning achievement; (3) to assess knowledge retention after using the toolkit; (4) to analyze relationships among study levels, English proficiency levels, and learning achievement before and after toolkit use; (5) to explore students' perceptions of the toolkit's design, retention development, and implementation. The sample consisted of 200 students (100 primary and 100 secondary) from public schools in Bangkok's Thonburi district, using a multi-level group research design. Data collection instruments included the instructional toolkit, achievement tests, questionnaires, and interviews. Data were gathered before, during, and after the intervention, and analyzed using both quantitative (SPSS) and qualitative (content analysis) methods. The research revealed that 95 percent of students and teachers acknowledged the toolkit's efficiency and efficacy, with significant improvements noted post-intervention. The toolkit effectively enhanced knowledge retention in verb tense structures across different educational levels, showing particular resonance with higher-grade students and those at intermediate proficiency. Practical implications of the findings include (1) the need for school policies to mandate OBE-aligned toolkits with age-appropriate designs, and (2) the importance of incorporating self-paced, practical language application opportunities for Thai EFL students. This study contributes to discourses on instructional innovation in EFL contexts by underscoring tailored toolkits' potential to address specific linguistic challenges while aligning with educational reforms. Future research could explore adaptability across age groups, design variations, and other complex linguistic elements.

Abstract: Course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) exposes an entire class of students to scientific research and is thought to increase students' knowledge retention in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education. Microbial engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that combines science and engineering. We transformed a microbial engineering course into a CURE-type course by adopting an interest-oriented case teaching approach. Based on an investigation of the interest of students, which showed that the topics related to food and health were students' favourites, we selected beer brewing, glutamate fermentation and Monascus cultivation as teaching topics. To simulate the reality of industrial fermentation, pilot-scale fermentation equipment was selected and installed. The course focused on fermentation research; most of the time was spent on performing experiments, and theoretical lectures were held at the intervals. To complete the course in 10 days, three series of experiments were alternatively carried out, and students took turns to conduct fermentation control and process analyses in groups. A questionnaire survey showed that students were satisfied with the CURE-type course, their fermentation knowledge and engineering skills were improved, their research abilities were developed, and their scientific attitudes were cultivated. CURE-type courses are worth popularising in biology teaching.

Abstract: Background: Online synchronous learning in higher education frequently struggles to overcome the social presence gap, resulting in dissatisfaction and poor learning outcomes. Objectives: This study examined the effectiveness of desktop-based virtual reality (VR) social platforms compared to video conferencing (VC) platforms in enhancing students' learning gains and experiences in online synchronous learning. Methods: The study used a within-subject design, involving 34 college students in two online lecture modules, one via a VR social platform and another through a VC platform. Knowledge assessments occurred pre- and post-modules and after 1 week. Students also completed post-module questionnaires to evaluate their learning experience, in terms of social presence, easiness of use and perceived emotions. In-depth interviews provided further insights into their experiences with both platforms. Results: The study showed that using VR social platforms for online synchronous learning enhanced immediate knowledge, especially in students less interested in the content, yet it did not notably impact long-term knowledge retention. Despite no significant findings in social presence from questionnaires, interviews indicated that the VR's heightened interactivity might be offset by the effect of not seeing others' real appearances in promoting social presence. Furthermore, the VC platform was found to be easier to use, attributed to its familiarity and user-friendliness. Finally, students experienced increased fun, awe and interest, along with reduced boredom, when using the VR social platform. Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of VR to enrich online learning while underscoring the need for effective strategies facilitating a smooth integration into educational settings.

Abstract: Background: The voices virtual on-screen characters use has been shown to impact learning and perception outcomes. Recent replication research on these voices showed that synthetic voices were not a detriment if produced by a high-quality engine with clear articulation. The current manuscript examines previous accent research that utilized now outdated engines, to determine if the impact of accents still holds with high-quality engines and voice actors. Objectives: To investigate the impact on learning and perceptions with pedagogical agents speaking in accented voices, synthetic voices, and the interaction between the two using modern voice engines. Methods: This study is a between-subjects two (accent) by two (type) factorial design to determine the impact the voice accent, voice type, and the interaction have on learning retention, learning transfer, mental effort efficiency, and perception measures. 197 participants were recruited from the online Amazon's Mechanical Turk with qualifications of 18 years of age, "normal or corrected-to-normal hearing", and located with the continental United States of America. Results and Conclusions: There were no significant differences between the accented conditions or interaction effects, deviating from previous research that showed impact of accents on learning. The synthetic condition had significantly lower knowledge retention, knowledge transfer, mental effort efficiency, and perception measures than the human professional. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering voice quality when designing pedagogical agents. Previous research showed synthetic voices perform as well as the average voice, and this research continues the narrative of voice quality by showing professional recordings outperform modern synthetic engines.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Microlearning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students' accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore nursing faculty experiences in creating and using short videos to engage prelicensure nursing students. Short videos are an innovative teaching strategy to help engage learners by decreasing cognitive workload and increasing knowledge retention. Learner engagement in prelicensure nursing education is imperative for the development of the clinical judgment skills necessary for safe and effective patient care. There is a lack of nursing education literature on the creation and use of short videos and limited literature using the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) as the theoretical framework in nursing education. The research question is as follows: What are nursing faculty experiences creating and using short videos to engage prelicensure nursing students? The cognitive theory of multimedia learning in conjunction with the domains of learner engagement was used as the theoretical framework for this study. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were gathered using a basic qualitative inquiry approach. The information-rich data was analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis to find five themes and two subthemes. Participants shared a similar process in how they selected or created videos to use in their didactic course. The five themes are identified gaps in instructional plan, established criteria for using videos, related videos to an activity or discussion, positive student reactions, and increase in student engagement. Findings from this study add to the body of knowledge about creating or using short videos in nursing education. Practical implications include recommendations for the effective incorporation of short videos into the didactic portion of the course to engage prelicensure nursing students. Future research that includes nursing students as participants, graduate nursing faculty as participants, exploring the individual CTML principles in nursing education, how short videos impact student performance, and how short videos impact knowledge retention is needed.

Abstract: Retaining an employee's knowledge becomes a significant challenge when skilled and experienced employees leave an organization. Human resources (HR) professionals/leaders at public and private universities are particularly concerned about the detrimental impact of knowledge loss in such cases. Grounded in the knowledge management cycle (KMC) model, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore strategies that HR professionals/leaders of public and private universities use to enhance employee knowledge retention. The participants were nine HR professionals/leaders in public and private universities who successfully enhanced employee knowledge retention. Data were collected using semistructured interviews and a review of publicly available company documentation. Through thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (a) mentoring and coaching, (b) creating a culture of learning and development, (c) employee engagement culture, and (d) effective knowledge repository system. A key recommendation for HR professionals/leaders is to create an environment of trust, openness, and excellent relationships with the university's employees. The implications for positive social include the potential for HR professionals/leaders at public and private universities to drive competitive advantage and business growth, enhance employee well-being, and expand job opportunities and sustainability in local communities.

Abstract: Conference Title: TENCON 2024 - 2024 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 1 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 4 Conference Location: Singapore, Singapore In today's fast-paced organizational environments, the need for engaging and effective knowledge transfer tools is paramount. Traditional static playbooks often fail to engage, and hence, support knowledge retention by their users in organizations. This paper presents a realization of an interactive web app playbook, meant to mitigate these challenges and provide a dynamic and user-friendly platform that fosters high engagement, simplification of complex methodologies, and improved transfer of knowledge. The intuitive interface is complemented by an AI-based chatbot assistant to provide contextually relevant and personalized responses to user queries. Our study has found that the interactive playbook considerably improves user engagement, comprehension, and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 18 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 20 Conference Location: Miami, FL, USA This paper employs knowledge distillation to optimize neural network compression processes via reducing the approximate bisimulation error between two neural networks. The paper calculates the approximate bisimulation error between two neural networks and derives the relationship between the approximate bisimulation error and the soft loss of knowledge distillation processes. Then, we propose a knowledge distillation optimization framework to further reduce the approximate bisimulation error between the original neural network and its compressed version. This method can significantly enhance the trustworthiness of the neural network compression methods as the approximate bisimulation error is reduced.

Abstract: Acute stroke management is an essential component of neurology residency education. Internal medicine trainees are less likely to receive dedicated training in acute stroke care despite having to care for hospitalized patients with a stroke diagnosis. Background Acute stroke management is an essential component of neurology residency education. Internal medicine trainees are less likely to receive dedicated training in acute stroke care despite having to care for hospitalized patients with a stroke diagnosis.The objectives of this survey-based quality improvement study were to: 1) assess pre-existing confidence and knowledge about acute stroke care among internal medicine trainees and 2) measure change after an institution-specific, protocol-oriented "value added lecture" (intervention). Objective The objectives of this survey-based quality improvement study were to: 1) assess pre-existing confidence and knowledge about acute stroke care among internal medicine trainees and 2) measure change after an institution-specific, protocol-oriented "value added lecture" (intervention).Pre-intervention survey and knowledge assessment was given to internal medicine physicians, residents, and students, followed by the intervention on acute stroke management, during academic year 2019-2020. Post-intervention assessment was administered immediately post-intervention, and again at end of rotation. A 10-point Likert scale was used to indicate confidence. Statistics were performed using Student's T-Test. Methods Pre-intervention survey and knowledge assessment was given to internal medicine physicians, residents, and students, followed by the intervention on acute stroke management, during academic year 2019-2020. Post-intervention assessment was administered immediately post-intervention, and again at end of rotation. A 10-point Likert scale was used to indicate confidence. Statistics were performed using Student's T-Test.Fifty-one respondents participated, out of a possible 162 (31% participation rate); 13 (25%) of the 51 respondents completed the delayed post-intervention survey. Only twenty-six (51%) participants had previously received a lecture on acute stroke management. Respondents' knowledge and confidence on acute stroke management improved after intervention (p<0.0001), with no change in these scores by end of rotation (p=0.31). Forty-five (88%) respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a targeted stroke didactic was a useful part of internal medicine training.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 10th International Conference on Big Data Computing and Communications (BigCom) Conference Start Date: 2024, Aug. 9 Conference End Date: 2024, Aug. 11 Conference Location: Dalian, China Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is an effective paradigm which matches the enterprises' demands of leveraging more valuable features to achieve better model performance while keeping their data decentralized. Training costs, especially communication costs among parties have always been one of the major bottlenecks in VFL. Almost all existing approaches is aimed at optimizing the overhead of a single VFL task. However, there are situations where a passive party cooperates with multiple active parties to jointly train VFL models task by task, which causing the passive party incurring significant duplication of training costs. In this scenario, because these methods tailored for single VFL task cannot leverage the inter-task correlations, they might be suboptimal in terms of optimization and the model's performance may also be less satisfactory. In this article, we focus on reducing the training overhead of the passive party in multiple VFL collaborations. We utilize all local data of the passive party, including data discarded in the VFL task, for unsupervised training to accelerate the convergence speed of VFL training. Some new problems arise due to the data heterogeneity between tasks and the issue of catastrophic forgetting in models. In order to solve these issues, we propose a training-efficient algorithm named MultiVFL for multiple VFL collaborations. MultiVFL adopt parameter-level knowledge retention and fine-tuning algorithm, motivated by the sparsity of the bottom model in VFL. Through this approach, MultiVFL is able to maintain efficient training across various scenarios. We conducted experiments on two datasets containing five tasks each, and the results indicate that MultiVFL can continuously and efficiently learn tasks in multiple rounds of VFL collaboration. Compared to traditional VFL methods, MultiVFL saves about 70% of training overhead on tabular datasets and 21% on image datasets with excellent model accuracy.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA This research-to-practice paper described how a student-centered learning pedagogy and AR techniques are used to enhance Anatomy and Physiology undergraduate education. Throughout the evolution of biomedical and engineering education, teachers and students have experimented with various forms of learning platforms and techniques in hopes of enhancing the learning experience. However, these efforts have not always been interactive, leading to student burnout, disengagement, decreased knowledge retention, and lower grades. To tackle this issue, We propose a method to improve both Anatomy and Physiology education. Students can learn biomedical science as well as other engineering educational topics with a more interactive experience using our proposed method via AR device, i.e., HoloLens 2. This project used an exploratory method, which involves conducting user studies using HoloLens 2 as a medium to teach students course-related topics. This method is based on a Student-Centered Learning pedagogy and allows students to walk through course materials with different paths and paces based on the students' preferences, allowing us to investigate the relationship between information retention and the AR platform. Said user studies are conducted to collect qualitative data about students' learning outcomes and their opinions on our proposed method. Through user studies, we recruited 30 students to take part in the lesson plans created and curated by professors in the associated university. Students are given quizzes before taking part to test knowledge of the subjects that they have not been introduced to before and then are allowed to tackle modules at their own pace. They are then given the option to attempt modules at their discretion. This is due to the lesson plan being designed as a tree structure, with multiple pathways that can be navigated either upward or downwards depending on whether they have completed the prerequisite module. After studying the lessons provided, they are given a quiz in a virtual environment to test the knowledge that they have gained while using the device. When calculating the averages of both assessments, students on average had an improvement of 10 percent in scores after using our proposed method compared to the quiz scores collected before using the device. They were also given a survey on their thoughts concerning using the HoloLens 2 device after finishing the study where 96 percent of students believe that the tools and techniques from augmented reality are both exciting and would find it useful in the study of other disciplines. 90 percent of students also found that both listening and conversational skills are frequently utilized while using Augmented Reality.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA This research-to-practice full paper describes the machine learning techniques for predicting students' learning preferences and cognitive load in a mixed reality environment. As the construction industry increasingly adopts sensing technologies, the demand for hands-on learning experiences in construction education becomes imperative. However, challenges arise in educating the future workforce due to limited access to construction sites for practical learning and the high costs associated with these technologies. To overcome these obstacles, educators are turning to virtual learning environments, such as mixed reality (MR), to provide engaging learning experiences. While MR has been utilized in construction education for simulating activities, the design of such learning environments often neglects to account for the varying learning preferences necessary for effective navigation and optimal learning outcomes. This makes it necessary to develop intelligent learning environments that can detect students' learning preferences and present information based on individual preferences. Extant studies have shown that eye movement data, particularly fixations from virtual learning environments, provide valuable insights into users' cognitive processes. Studies have also shown that leveraging machine learning algorithms enables the analysis and interpretation of eye-tracking data, offering deeper insights into students' learning preferences. In this study, nineteen undergraduate students participated in hands-on activities involving the implementation of sensing technologies within an MR learning environment. Questionnaires on learning preferences were used to assess individual learning preferences. By employing machine learning techniques on eye-tracking data and subjective evaluations of learning preferences, the study presents models that can detect students' learning preferences. The study compared performance metrics from three classifiers - Ensemble, Neural Network, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and the Ensemble classifier was identified as the most accurate, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% for the test model. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning models in detecting learning preferences most effectively for the user's interactions. The classification models, when implemented in the MR environment, can identify users who may require additional support tailored to their specific learning preferences. Thereby enhancing their interaction with the MR learning environment. Understanding and accommodating diverse learning preferences in MR learning environments can offer personalized experiences for effective engagement and knowledge retention in construction education. By tailoring instructional methods to individual preferences, educators can create inclusive environments that foster deeper comprehension and maximize learning outcomes.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA This work-in-progress research paper presents an innovative learning methodology based on gamification and the concept of “building your own knowledge” to motivate and spark students' interest in quantum computing. Using the Scratch platform with younger high school students, basic quantum computing principles are taught through interactive mini-games, focusing on concepts like superposition and entanglement. For older students, a more formal methodology is proposed that uses the Bloch Sphere representation via the CreatiCode platform. This paper discusses an implementation of the proposal with high school groups, including statistical analysis and feedback collection to assess concept acquisition, strengths, weaknesses and student satisfaction. Data is gathered through questionnaires and interviews, enabling comparison with external test groups for comprehensive evaluation. This approach integrates computational thinking, gamification and visual knowledge construction, aligning with STEM education principles and fostering knowledge retention.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA This research-to-practice study aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) MCQ generation system for engineering students, with a focus on adaptive learning, educational technology, and innovative assessment tools, to enhance personalized learning. Engineering education faces significant academic performance challenges, with first-year retention rates in STEM fields ranging between 27% to 46%, largely due to poor academic achievements. Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) identify misconceptions, reinforce knowledge retention, and offer efficient assessment methods for engineering education. This interactive method improves attention and memory retention, reinforces knowledge, and improves comprehension. In this context, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has marked a significant advancement. Our literature review method employed a systematic approach, analyzing peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, and authoritative reports to uncover the trends and challenges in AI-driven quiz generation. The notable gap identified in our literature review is the lack of LLM-based adaptive quiz generation methods specifically for engineering education. Our methodology involved sourcing relevant structured datasets, data pre-processing, embedding generation, vector database storage, hybrid-search retrieval, LLM query results feed, prompt engineering, and context-based response. In this research, we adopted Vectara as a vector database tool for its automatic data ingestion capabilities and seamless integration with generative AI applications. Prompt engineering involves a dual-prompt approach, where the Contextual Question Prompt formulates questions based on user topics and chat history, while the Answer Question Prompt manages MCQ responses with explanations, ensuring relevant and contextually accurate interactions. Evaluation includes topic relevancy, answer relevancy, and a contextual relevancy score. Preliminary results indicate promising results for the generation of accurate and contextually appropriate questions with minimal hallucinations. The quiz generation system was deployed using Streamlit cloud-based architecture to showcase the functionality. Looking forward, we aim to expand the dataset to include more diverse engineering disciplines and to refine the retrieval algorithms to better handle complex diagrams and mathematical expressions commonly found in engineering texts.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA Contribution: This research full paper investigates the use of Spaced Repetition (SR) methodology in teaching markup and scripting programming languages to assess its impact on academic performance, knowledge retention and student perception of the learning process. Background: There is a quest for strategies capable of supporting students and helping them achieve better learning outcomes. The SR strategy, rooted in Ebbinghaus’ Forgetting Curve, is widely utilized across multiple domains. This methodology has shown promising results in foreign language and medicine education, although it is not yet extensively explored in computer science education. Since its efficacy has been demonstrated notably in foreign language education, investigating its application within Computer and Engineering education disciplines could be beneficial, as programming languages share learning characteristics common to natural language. Research Questions: What is the impact of using SR methodology in teaching markup and scripting languages in relation to academic performance, knowledge retention and students’ perception of learning? Methodology: The methodological journey of this research included four phases: (1) Systematic literature review, (2) Development of an SR methodology approach for teaching markup and script languages, (3) Semi-structured interviews, and (4) Planning, execution and analysis of the field experiment. The statistical models used were the difference between means for measurements of the two samples and the chi-square test with two criteria. Findings: The results indicate significant differences between class grades, validating the influence of Interleaved Study with Spaced Repetition on improving participants' academic performance and content retention, compared to Concentrated Study with Massed Repetition. However, the results do not indicate that the teaching method has an influence on the students’ perception of learning.

Abstract: Background: The predominant pedagogy of traditional lecture-based learning should include meaningful active content to foster clinical judgment, engagement, and knowledge retention. Innovative active learning strategies must be tested to understand if they can better facilitate nursing learners’ readiness for practice.  Aims: This research study investigated the impact of a healthcare simulation escape room as an innovative platform on individual and team clinical judgment to determine whether this active learning strategy can benefit nursing learners’ preparedness and increase clinical judgment.  Method: A randomized, double-blinded, waitlist control design was used to examine the effect of a healthcare simulation escape room on clinical judgment. Nursing learners participated in didactic learning, a healthcare simulation escape room, and an obstetric hemorrhage simulation as part of the maternal clinical course. The Lasater Clinical Judgment Rubric (LCJR) evaluated individual clinical judgment, and the modified Critical Behavior Checklist (CBC) evaluated group clinical judgment. A demographic survey with additional questions was collected to determine if any teams had prior knowledge of the experiences. The data from the observation checklists was analyzed using an independent t-test, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANOVA) to examine the difference between clinical judgment scores from the waitlist control and intervention groups. An alpha level of .05 was used in the statistical analysis. The demographic data was analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results: The clinical judgment scores increased for individual and team participants who experienced the healthcare simulation escape room. The ANCOVA comparing group differences of the LCJR total scale score revealed that the intervention group ( M = 23.04 SD = 4.06) had significantly higher scores ( F (1,76) = 100.44, p < .001) on the LCJR total scale score than the waitlist control group ( M = 14.53, SD = 2.48) controlling for age and sex.). The participants who completed the healthcare simulation escape room ( M = 22, SD = 2.21) reported significantly higher levels of clinical judgment in the management of an obstetric hemorrhage than the participants who did not experience a healthcare simulation escape room ( M = 16.7, SD = 2.75), t (25) = -5.56, p < .001). Discussion: The study demonstrated that healthcare simulation escape rooms as an innovative platform can play a significant role in enhancing both individual and team clinical judgment. Clinical judgment is crucial for nursing students to provide high-quality, safe patient care, which is rooted in effective educational methodologies. Nursing education should intentionally craft teaching strategies that cater to the needs of contemporary learners while fostering the development of clinical judgment. Nurse educators are encouraged to explore and disseminate successful teaching strategies that build the knowledge, skills, and attitudes essential for cultivating clinical judgment. Further research is warranted to explore the relationship between other innovative platforms, such as the healthcare simulation escape rooms, and the advancement of clinical judgment.

Ethnobotanical survey of medicinal and ritual plants utilized by the indigenous communities of Benguet province, Philippines

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/ethnobotanical-survey-medicinal-ritual-plants/docview/3168948091/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background The Sto. Niño site in Benguet province, Philippines was once a mining area that has now been transformed into an agricultural land. In this area, there has been significant integration of the three indigenous people (IPs) Ibaloi, Kankanaeys and Kalanguyas with the Ilocano community. These IPs safeguard biodiversity and traditional knowledge, including medicinal plant use. However, the documentation of these plant species and their medicinal applications has not been systematic, with the resultant loss of knowledge across generations. This study aims to document the medicinal and ritual plants used by the indigenous communities at the site, in order to preserve and disseminate traditional medicinal knowledge that would otherwise be lost. Methods Ethnobotanical data were collected in Sto. Niño, Brgy. Ambassador, Municipality of Tublay, Benguet, Philippines, and collected through semi-structured interviews, together with focus group discussions (FGD). A total of 100 residents (39 male and 61 female) were interviewed. Among them, 12 were key interviewees, including community elders and farmers, while the rest were selected through the convenience and snowball technique. Demographic information collected from the interviewees included age, gender, and occupation. Ethnobotanical information collected focused on medicinal plants, including the specific parts of plants used, methods of preparation, modes of treatment, and the types of ailments treated. Ethnobotanical quantitative indices of the relative frequency of citations (RFC) and informant consensus factor (ICF) were calculated to evaluate the plant species that were utilized by the community. Results A total of 28 medicinal plants from 20 different families and 6 ritual plants from 5 different families were documented. Asteraceae, Poaceae, and Lamiaceae (10.71%) family are the most mentioned medicinal plant species, followed by Myrtaceae and Euphorbiaceae (7.14%). The most widely used growth form were herbs (46.4%), while leaves (61.5%) were the most utilized plant part, and the preparation of a decoction (62.2%) was the most preferred method of processing and application. The medicinal plants were most commonly utilized for wound-healing, cough and colds, stomachache and kidney trouble, whereas ritual plants were largely used for healing, protection, and funeral ceremonies.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 5th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Engineering (ICAICE) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 8 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 10 Conference Location: Wuhu, China The topic classification task on academic papers significantly contributes to the analysis of valuable papers. Classic methods first build a paper citation graph and then classify each paper node with a graph neural network (GNN). Some successors notice the rich semantics within the text features, namely the title and abstract of one paper, and start to extract the node representation from a text attributed graph (TAG). But the heterogeneity between graph topology and text sequence requires the representation learning algorithm to aggregate knowledge from both sides. Existing works embed the text feature in the corresponding node directly with a separate language model, so as to couple the knowledge in a cascading style. However, this text embedding algorithm faces a severe problem on calculation complexity because of the coupling. Given that the complexity of GNN grows exponentially as the number of layers increases, the high cost of the language model is further amplified to an intolerable degree. To conquer this challenge, we propose the token embedding graph neural network (TEGNN). Instead of cascading the language model and GNN, a shared token embedding layer is introduced to serve as the knowledge link between them. This structure decouples two modules without any knowledge loss, decreasing the complexity considerably. Experiments on the large-scale dataset prove the enhancement of efficiency. Compared with baseline algorithms, TEGNN decreases the training time by 70.17% on condition that the classification accuracy is increased by 1.04%.

Abstract: We are living in a technology-rich world, which not only brings conveniences but also brings confusions, i.e., which technical solution is the best? In different contexts, "best" has different meanings. In learning sciences, it may mean higher retention rate, longer retention duration, or any other effectiveness-related measurements. In this study, multi-space learning is defined as a micro procedure of human learning which may take place in more than one space, with an implicit or explicit pursuit for effective learning strategies, and such effectiveness can be measured by the indicators based on the knowledge retention duration. This book explores the measurement of learning effectiveness and the optimization of knowledge retention by modeling the learning process and building the mathematical foundation of multi-space learning theory. Multi-space learning is defined in this book as a micro-process of human learning that can take place in more than one space, with the goal of effective learning and knowledge retention. This book models the learning process as a temporal sequence of concept learning, drawing on established principles and empirical evidence. It also introduces the matroid to strengthen the mathematical foundation of multi-space learning theory and applies the theory to vocabulary and mathematics learning, respectively. The results show that, for vocabulary learning, the method can be used to estimate the effectiveness of a single learning strategy, to detect the mutual interference that might exist between learning strategies, and to predict the optimal combination of strategies. In mathematical learning, it was found that timing is crucial in both first learning and second learning in scheduling optimization to maximize the intersection effective interval. The title will be of interest to researchers and students in a wide range of areas, including educational technology, learning sciences, mathematical applications, and mathematical psychology.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 4th Asian Conference on Innovation in Technology (ASIANCON) Conference Start Date: 2024, Aug. 23 Conference End Date: 2024, Aug. 25 Conference Location: Pimari Chinchwad, India Press Reports in general have been published in text based format for a vast period of time, although the old way of publishing reports may have been effective initially, it has led to a decrease in audience engagement and attention span. The study offers a novel solution to the problem of users’ attention spans getting shorter. Therefore, to retain user engagement and increase content quality, the proposed solution aims to create an automated system that uses press reports to generate dynamic video content. This technology improves user comprehension and engagement by utilizing audio-visual synthesis and natural language processing techniques. The models that are implemented have performed well during the Testing Phase by showing an average accuracy of 82 percentage from the NLP Large Language Models and 89 percentage from the Machine Learning Models and the outcomes reveal increased knowledge retention and user engagement. Finally, this study offers a novel method of communication by automatically converting press releases into videos for maximum viewer engagement.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 15 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 18 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA Data Science (DS) aims to extract knowledge from large amounts of data. Organizations can use the retrieved insights to achieve various performance improvements. However, DS projects often fail to fulfill their objectives due to the explorative nature of this discipline and technical as well as managerial challenges. Consequently, new approaches to support DS project execution are sought after. A viable contribution in this regard is improving knowledge retention in DS to predict socio-technical obstacles of an undertaking and derive best practices. Therefore, in this work, a template for describing the central characteristics of DS projects is proposed using a Design Science Research approach. The artifact is structured based on the common DS project stages and features 32 fields, enabling comparability and transparency in DS. The applicability of the template is demonstrated based on three DS use cases from the literature. While further steps for evaluation are pending, the template can serve as a foundation for developing a categorization model for DS projects in the future.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 21st International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 6 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 8 Conference Location: Paris, France This research paper aims to analyse the significance and utilisation of artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on ChatGPT, in learning systems. Integrating AI tools like ChatGPT has become a prominent trend in education. This study examines the impact of ChatGPT in higher STEM education, drawing on scientific articles published between 2020 and 2024. It explores whether ChatGPT produces positive learning outcomes, the potential approaches for its application now and in the future, and its effectiveness as a teaching tool. Findings from this literature review highlight the numerous benefits of using ChatGPT in higher STEM education. These benefits include improved opportunities for students to engage with AI technology, the provision of personalised support that meets individual learning needs, and an overall increase in the quality of the learning experience. Furthermore, ChatGPT enables greater accessibility of information, which encourages deeper learning and better knowledge retention. Despite these advantages, it is crucial to acknowledge the ethical considerations and biases inherent in AI models that must be addressed. Empirical evidence suggests that ChatGPT significantly improves student engagement by delivering personalised responses tailored to individual learning needs, offering timely and constructive feedback and making information more easily accessible. Together, these factors contribute to improved educational outcomes and encourage the development of students' critical thinking skills. The inclusion of ChatGPT in educational contexts marks a transformative shift in teacher roles, moving away from traditional content delivery methods. This evolution fosters a personalised and differentiated learning environment, allowing teachers to respond more effectively to the diverse needs of their students. There are obvious limitations that require further study. The reason for the insufficient number of empirical research is that ChatGPT in education is a relatively new AI tool.

Abstract: Purpose: This quality improvement project aimed to impact participants’ knowledge, knowledge retention, and confidence levels about using ketamine as a treatment method for patients with treatment-resistant depression. Background: Major depressive disorder is a prevalent mental health disorder within our communities. Notably, individuals with depression can experience poor responses to two first-line treatments leading to treatment-resistant depression. Therefore, there is a need for mental health care providers to utilize efficacious alternative treatment modalities like ketamine to treat this patient population. An outpatient clinic in Chandler, Arizona has identified treatment-resistant depression as a frequent outcome in the clients they serve who have depression; mental health care providers in this clinic may benefit from an educational intervention regarding the utilization of ketamine as a treatment for treatment- resistant depression. Methods: A cohort of providers was strategically selected for participation in an evidence-based educational intervention focused on ketamine's demonstrated efficacy in treatment-resistant depression. This quality improvement initiative employed quantitative methodology to assess provider knowledge and confidence metrics at an outpatient clinic in Chandler, Arizona, utilizing anonymous paper-based questionnaires administered pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and one-week post-intervention to evaluate knowledge retention and practice modification intent. The surveys incorporated open-ended questions to identify perceived barriers to ketamine implementation in TRD treatment protocols. Results: A total of 5 behavioral and mental health care providers with varying levels of experience in the field were recruited and completed all three surveys. Pretests and posttests showed an overall improvement in knowledge following the educational session. Additionally, the subsequent posttest administered at the following weekly meeting showed no statistically significant change in knowledge compared to the initial posttest. Outcomes also show that the participants’ confidence level in the benefits and utility of Ketamine for TRD significantly increased after the informational PowerPoint presentation. Conclusion: Data analysis from the results of this QI project supports the implementation of education to improve providers’ overall knowledge about the benefits and efficacy of ketamine for TRD. The statistically significant increase in survey scores and self-reported confidence levels may indicate that educational sessions can improve provider knowledge, long-term knowledge, and confidence. Keywords: major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, ketamine

Abstract: Background: Chronic exposure to adverse experiences in childhood is implicated in the development of psychiatric disorders. The human mind develops hierarchically, from bottom to top, and organizes in a use-dependent manner. Early life adversity can impact functioning across multiple domains. Timing of adversity relative to sensitive developmental periods can likewise impact functioning. Improved outcomes are supported through the employment of neurodevelopmentally informed interventions. Purpose: This DNP Project aimed to increase providers’ confidence, knowledge, and intent to utilize the concepts of the Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics in patient treatment techniques. Methods: This DNP Project employed an asynchronously delivered video presentation on the Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics. The Project Director administered Pre and Post intervention evaluations of provider knowledge and confidence to apply the concepts described in the presentation. The presentation and surveys were hosted on a dedicated website. Survey answer data was collected from the website and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Outcomes are reported utilizing descriptive statistics and a paired t-Test. Results compared the difference in mean scores between pre and post surveys. Results: No difference observed in knowledge retention. Paired t-test of Likert Scale data yielded significant difference in provider confidence and intent to utilize. Conclusions: Provider education is an effective way to improve confidence and intent to utilize, however, better questions may improve reliability of knowledge retention measures in future iterations.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 5th International Conference on Data Intelligence and Cognitive Informatics (ICDICI) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 18 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 20 Conference Location: Tirunelveli, India With the help of hand gestures, the study presents a novel virtual whiteboard system that improves user engagement. Users can operate the virtual whiteboard interface with ease. This was all possible due to the system's usage of computer vision technology, which interprets and reacts to dynamic hand movements. The suggested system allows users to draw, erase, and alter content on the virtual canvas without making physical contact by integrating depth-sensing cameras and gesture recognition algorithms. This creates a natural and immersive experience. Because it encourages a more flexible and dynamic atmosphere for collaboration, the gesture-based interface is especially well-suited for learning environments, corporate gatherings, and innovative ideation sessions. The study assesses the accuracy, responsiveness, and user satisfaction of the system, offering insights into its possible uses and resolving issues related to gesture-based interaction. Future advancements in human-computer interaction can benefit from this research, which also advances the development of virtual collaboration tools that are easy to use. According to a recent research with 200 participants, the new technology proved to be beneficial in supporting dynamic and interactive presentations as seen by the 35% increase in user satisfaction and the 28% improvement in knowledge retention.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Medical Artificial Intelligence (MedAI) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 15 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 17 Conference Location: Chongqing, China Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) remains pivotal in structural biology, yet the task of protein particle picking, integral for 3D protein structure construction, is laden with manual inefficiencies. While recent AI tools such as Topaz and crYOLO are advancing the field, they do not fully address the challenges of cryo-EM images, including low contrast, complex shapes, and heterogeneous conformations. This study explored prompt-based learning to adapt the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM) for cryo-EM. This focus was driven by the desire to optimize model performance with a small number of labeled data without altering pre-trained parameters, aiming for a balance between adaptability and foundational knowledge retention. Through trials with three prompt-based learning strategies, namely head prompt, prefix prompt, and encoder prompt, we observed enhanced performance and reduced computational requirements compared to the fine-tuning approach. This work not only highlights the potential of prompting SAM in protein identification from cryo-EM micrographs but also suggests its broader promise in biomedical image segmentation and object detection.

Long-Term Knowledge Retention of Biochemistry Among Medical Students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Cross-Sectional Survey

Publication info: Nimer Mehyar; Awawdeh, Mohammed; Omair, Aamir; Aldawsari, Adi; Alshudukhi, Abdullah; et al. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/long-term-knowledge-retention-biochemistry-among/docview/3148807515/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: Biochemistry is a cornerstone of medical education. Its knowledge is integral to the understanding of complex biological processes and how they are applied in several areas in health care. Also, its significance is reflected in the way it informs the practice of medicine, which can guide and help in both diagnosis and treatment. However, the retention of biochemistry knowledge over time remains a dilemma. Long-term retention of such crucial information is extremely important, as it forms the foundation upon which clinical skills are developed and refined. The effectiveness of biochemistry education, and consequently its long-term retention, is influenced by several factors. Educational methods play a critical role; interactional and integrative teaching approaches have been suggested to enhance retention compared with traditional didactic methods. The frequency and context in which biochemistry knowledge is applied in clinical settings can significantly impact its retention. Practical application reinforces theoretical understanding, making the knowledge more accessible in the long term. Prior knowledge (familiarity) of information suggests that it is stored in long-term memory, which makes its retention in the long term easier to recall. Objectives: This investigation was conducted at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The aim of the study is to understand the dynamics of long-term retention of biochemistry among medical students. Specifically, it looks for the association between students’ familiarity with biochemistry content and actual knowledge retention levels. Methods: A cross-sectional correlational survey involving 240 students from King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences was conducted. Participants were recruited via nonprobability convenience sampling. A validated biochemistry assessment tool with 20 questions was used to gauge students’ retention in biomolecules, catalysis, bioenergetics, and metabolism. To assess students’ familiarity with the knowledge content of test questions, each question is accompanied by options that indicate students’ prior knowledge of the content of the question. Statistical analyses tests such as Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and chi-square tests were used. Results: Our findings revealed a significant correlation between students’ familiarity of the content with their knowledge retention in the biomolecules ( r =0.491; P <.001), catalysis ( r =0.500; P <.001), bioenergetics ( r =0.528; P <.001), and metabolism ( r =0.564; P <.001) biochemistry knowledge domains. Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of familiarity (prior knowledge) in evaluating the retention of biochemistry knowledge. Although limited in terms of generalizability and inherent biases, the research highlights the crucial significance of student’s familiarity in actual knowledge retention of several biochemistry domains. These results might be used by educators to customize instructional methods in order to improve students’ long-term retention of biochemistry information and boost their clinical performance.

Tolerated Organizational Forgetting in the U.S. Air Force: A Case Study Analysis of Knowledge Loss Among Government Civilian Employees

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/tolerated-organizational-forgetting-u-s-air-force/docview/3148105521/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Organizations do not learn well. As a result, they lose valuable knowledge. When knowledge is lost in organizations, workers are forced to spend as much as 25% of their workday looking for information to do their jobs, contributing to workplace frustration, anxiety, and personnel retention challenges (Businesswire, 2022). Numerous studies on knowledge management, organizational memory, and organizational forgetting have expanded organizations’ view of knowledge as a valuable organizational resource. The problem of interest in this dissertation is that while prescriptive measures to retain organizational knowledge exist, organizations continue to lose valuable knowledge. Such knowledge loss in the government contributes to performance inefficiencies, unnecessary costs to U.S. taxpayers, and the potential inability of military forces to meet national security requirements. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the contextual issues that influence how and why forgetting is tolerated within strategic-level organizations of the Air Force as experienced by the civilian workforce. The research questions that guided this study are as follows: Why do Air Force organizations tolerate forgetting despite policy directives and available prescriptive remedies? How do Air Force organizations prioritize knowledge loss in their learning and knowledge management activities? and How are organizational processes, systems, and culture managed to address knowledge loss? The study expands the existing models of organizational forgetting that focus on intentional and unintentional knowledge loss to include forgetting that is neither of these but is tolerated by organizations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 mid- to senior-level Air Force civilian employees representing eight strategic-level organizations. Four themes were identified as contributing to tolerated organizational forgetting. First, motivation and values within the organization often relegate knowledge management efforts to other tasks. Second, a culture of acceptance and lack of accountability habituate organizations to knowledge loss. Third, organizational focus on near-term objectives creates strategic blindness. Lastly, undocumented business processes contribute to a loss of governance and ad hoc practices. These findings provide practical considerations to address tolerated forgetting in organizations and provide new avenues for refining organizational forgetting theory.

Abstract: Purpose: Renal ultrasound is a non-invasive method to assess for obstructive acute kidney injury (AKI). Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has been shown to be a good screening tool for obstructive AKI, and with formal training, has high sensitivity and specificity. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of integrating a novel renal POCUS curriculum into an existing two-week nephrology rotation for internal medicine residents. Methods: We enrolled internal medicine residents rotating on a two-week nephrology rotation between September 2022 and June 2023. Pre-recorded online lectures and a hands-on session on image acquisition were provided. Pre-and post-rotation confidence questionnaires and knowledge tests were collected. At the end of the rotation, participants were evaluated using a skills checklist. Evaluation for knowledge retention was assessed 6-12-months post-rotation with a post-survey and knowledge test. Results: Of the 16 residents that were enrolled, 12 residents completed pre- and post-rotation questionnaires and tests, and 15 residents completed the 6-12-month follow-up. The confidence level showed significant improvement post-test and at 6-12-month follow-up. Knowledge test scores showed a trend towards improvement that did not achieve statistical significance (pre- 6.0 [5.0-7.25], post- 6.5 [5.75-8.0], 6-12-months 7.0 [6.0-8.0] p=0.40). On the skills checklist, an average of 16.8 out of 18 steps were done correctly. Conclusion: Our study showed confidence improvement and a trend towards knowledge improvement after integrating a novel Renal POCUS curriculum into a nephrology rotation. Further iterative changes, such as deliberate practice, or practice with immediate feedback, should be considered.Purpose: Renal ultrasound is a non-invasive method to assess for obstructive acute kidney injury (AKI).

Abstract: This article proposes the application of the AHP method in an office furniture remanufacturing company, with the aim of optimizing knowledge retention and management. In particular, it seeks to establish the optimal retrieval route for returned products. To this end, a bibliographic analysis was first carried out, which revealed the scarcity of previous studies on the subject, thus validating the relevance of this work. Subsequently, a practical application of the AHP method was carried out to define the weighting matrix of the evaluation criteria, applied to three specific pieces of furniture, which confirmed the effectiveness of the tool. In a complementary manner, Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model of knowledge management was used, guaranteeing the continuous updating of the matrices and the adequate retention of knowledge in the company. This methodology will increase the volume of remanufactured products and improve operating margins. By reaping both the economic and environmental benefits of this practice, the company will be able to reduce costs, generate additional revenue, improve its corporate image, and build customer loyalty. At the same time, this study promotes the sustainability and sustainable development of this practice within the company and, by extension, in the broader office furniture manufacturing industry. It can serve as a reference for other companies in this sector across different countries.

Abstract: Introduction: The influence of women in shaping household dietary habits is undeniable, with their maternal nutritional knowledge significantly impacting the overall well-being of their families. The study objective was to evaluate the impact of maternal nutritional knowledge on household dietary habits, emphasising the improvement in women’s nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours. Purpose: This study aimed to assess the immediate and long-term effects of a nutrition education intervention on the nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours of women. Methodology: A quasi-experimental research design was employed to assess the effects of a Nutrition Education Programme (NEP) on female caregivers’ nutrition knowledge and food-related behaviours. This study followed a four-phase approach: baseline survey, programme formulation, implementation and evaluation. Data were collected at various stages of this study using two measurement tools: a Dietary Diversity Questionnaire and a Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire. Results: Statistical analysis was performed to answer the research questions and to test the null hypotheses at a significance level of 0.05. The intervention positively affected nutrition knowledge, with the mean percentage increasing from 49.1% to 63.7% and reaching 64.4% at follow-up, indicating long-term knowledge retention. The findings of this study suggest a positive shift towards increased consumption of nutrient-rich food groups. There were significant improvements in the food groups’ consumption of the meat group (7.15 ± 2.35), eggs (1 ± 0), dairy (3.76 ± 1.19), cereal (8.78 ± 2.09), legumes (2.86 ± 0.95) and fats and oils (2.12 ± 0.55). Additionally, the variety of food groups consumed significantly improved ( p = 0.012) post-intervention, with an increasing trend in the consumption of a variety of food groups (7–9). Recommendation: Tailored nutrition education (NE) programs, in conjunction with addressing socioeconomic barriers positively impact nutritional behaviours, promote healthier food consumption patterns and assist in long-term knowledge retention in disadvantaged communities.

Abstract: The present thesis explores the design and implementation of a micro-MOOC focused on developing digital and entrepreneurial skills tailored specifically for the educational and school context, aligned with the DigCompEdu and EntreComp frameworks. The practical component involved the creation of a course on the Open edX platform, utilizing micro-learning principles to enhance participants’ competencies. Six existing MOOCs were reviewed to examine the instructional design, with a focus on structure, content, and pedagogical approaches relevant to micro-MOOCs. Relevant literature on online learning, micro-learning, instructional design, assessment and skills development was also examined to identify best practices and challenges in digital education. Creating this micro-MOOC series, involved the use of digital tools and applications, both external and in-built, which typically aim at enhancing knowledge retention and the learning process overall. These gamified features heavily drew on behaviorist principles illustrated in the relevant scientific literature used for this thesis. Digital learning and the creation of online courses for all purposes, are developing fast and this thesis aimed at highlighting that online learning as an educational innovation is not only technically complete, but also scientifically informed and solid. The courses reviewed and the scientific literature used for this thesis provided a strong foundation of examples and best practices equally relevant for educators, industry representatives and policy makers, while the course that was created specifically in the context of this thesis and the designated topic provided a great variety of activities, resources and content.

Abstract: When instructing very large groups of students in science, it can be difficult to engage all students in the content and measure their understanding. A major unaddressed challenge in science instruction is how specifically to design and implement strategies that engender active learning particularly in high-enrollment undergraduate courses. Active learning, which represents a diverse set of strategies, may include student engagement as part of instruction through discussions, active movement, and application (Bernstein, 2018; Cavanagh, et al. 2016; Michael, 2006 & Wilke, 2003). This study was designed to provide data addressing the gap in the literature regarding how the continual implementation of several active learning strategies in a large enrollment undergraduate Human Physiology class impacts students. I chose three active learning modalities for this study from Bernstein (2018) -- kinesthetic and movement, discussion, and problem-based learning and assigned each to units of study during the semester on a rotating basis so that the learning modality not the unit of study could be studied. This project specifically targeted students' perceptions of learning through the three modalities and students' retention of targeted content in Human Physiology. Students responded to an end of semester survey and evaluation on how their learning was impacted. A second research component analyzed students' performance on summative exams under different active learning modalities to provide a comparative analysis across modalities and duration of the study. I found that students were overwhelmingly positive toward participating in these active learning environments and found these activities to be enjoyable and improve cognizance. In survey responses, students reported that active learning improved their knowledge retention and confidence in understanding the content. Students enjoyed and retained information and improved content retention leading to improved examination performance when taught with kinesthetic methods.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore nursing faculty experiences in creating and using short videos to engage prelicensure nursing students. Short videos are an innovative teaching strategy to help engage learners by decreasing cognitive workload and increasing knowledge retention. Learner engagement in prelicensure nursing education is imperative for the development of the clinical judgment skills necessary for safe and effective patient care. There is a lack of nursing education literature on the creation and use of short videos and limited literature using the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) as the theoretical framework in nursing education. The research question is as follows: What are nursing faculty experiences creating and using short videos to engage prelicensure nursing students? The cognitive theory of multimedia learning in conjunction with the domains of learner engagement was used as the theoretical framework for this study. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were gathered using a basic qualitative inquiry approach. The information-rich data was analyzed using Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis to find five themes and two subthemes. Participants shared a similar process in how they selected or created videos to use in their didactic course. The five themes are identified gaps in instructional plan, established criteria for using videos, related videos to an activity or discussion, positive student reactions, and increase in student engagement. Findings from this study add to the body of knowledge about creating or using short videos in nursing education. Practical implications include recommendations for the effective incorporation of short videos into the didactic portion of the course to engage prelicensure nursing students. Future research that includes nursing students as participants, graduate nursing faculty as participants, exploring the individual CTML principles in nursing education, how short videos impact student performance, and how short videos impact knowledge retention is needed.

Abstract: This qualitative study intentionally gathered insights from 12 educators of varying seniority across three schools in the Nkangala Education District, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, regarding their experiences with mobile learning (facilitated through Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp Messenger) as a professional development and knowledge retention tool during the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings, derived from semi-structured interviews and document analysis, indicated that young educators positively embraced the implementation of Microsoft Teams and WhatsApp Messenger. Senior educators deemed WhatsApp Messenger less intimidating than Microsoft Teams, thereby endorsing it as the preferred medium for professional growth and knowledge retention. This led to a lack of incentive among senior educators to participate in the professional learning events facilitated by Microsoft Teams. Thus, they depended on the supplemental learning information disseminated via WhatsApp Messenger as the principal method for professional development and knowledge retention activities. The research identified multiple obstacles to utilising mobile learning for professional development and knowledge retention, specifically: insufficient ICT skills among senior educators, ineffective content facilitation by subject advisors, and inadequate communication and scheduling of professional development programs. The study advocated for a systematic coordination of: 1) a series of ICT skills training for underqualified educators; 2) peer teaching among novice, mid-career, and senior educators to address internal skills deficiencies; 3) effective communication among the district, circuits, and schools; and 4) skills audits for subject advisors to enhance competency in areas of deficiency. By presenting these recommendations, the report alerts schools, circuits, and districts to the likelihood that the Covid-19-induced adoption of hybrid professional development will become the standard practice.

Abstract: The Secretary of Public Health (SSP) faces a looming skills gap due to retirements and rotations of civil service staff. Critical knowledge retention is crucial across all generational cohorts due to the retirement and turnover of workers. This study develops a protocol that addresses the knowledge retention needs of the four generations (Baby Boomers, X, Y, Z) that coexist in the workforce to ensure the continuity of the Public Health Secretariat. The objective of the study is to develop a protocol for the management, transfer, and retention of critical knowledge. A scoping review is conducted in Scopus and Web of Science to develop the protocol, to identify critical knowledge workers through tool scores. The instrument developed in this research includes two pilots on Baby Boomer and Millennial workers. Both workers had critical and essential knowledge for the continuity of the organisation. The Baby Boomer worker presented a higher amount of tacit, operational, and individually owned knowledge, while the Millennial worker showed a predominance of tacit technological knowledge. This protocol provides a practical and adaptable approach to identifying and prioritising critical knowledge holders, allowing organisations to map and determine the amount of essential knowledge within the workforce. An important limitation of the study is the small sample of workers who participated in the pilot test of the protocol. Further research is therefore recommended in other public administrations and across all generations in employment.

Abstract: The discovery of the value and obstacles of scenario-based training for law enforcement from a phenomenological perspective was pursued from a grounded theory. The lack of empirical data and research guided the use of the grounded theory methodology, which attempts through individual professional interviews to discover the values and obstacles of scenario-based training for law enforcement. Clarifications and comprehensive definitions of the constituent elements characterizing a scenario-based training methodology are presented while concurrently identifying the intricate interdependencies between its qualitative measurement and associated cost factors. The exploration of implementing scenario-based training was conducted through personal interviews of criminal justice practitioners with significant experience in leadership and training positions who were knowledgeable about the training challenges. The data collected from these practitioners were analyzed qualitatively, and themes and patterns from the transcribed interviews were identified. Participant responses to research questions upheld underlying assumptions that scenario-based training is preferred. Benefits such as knowledge retention and obstacles such as cost and time have been identified, preventing scenario-based training from becoming a primary learning methodology. It was discovered that further research is necessary to identify solutions to the obstacles identified in the study of scenario-based training in law enforcement.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a new instructional toolkit for improving English grammar skills, particularly verb tense structures, among Thai EFL students. The research objectives were 1) to evaluate the toolkit’s effectiveness in enhancing students’ English grammar skills in verb tense structures; 2) to examine the impact on Thai EFL students’ learning achievement; 3) to assess knowledge retention after using the toolkit; 4) to analyze relationships among study levels, English proficiency levels, and learning achievement before and after toolkit use; 5) to explore students’ perceptions of the toolkit’s design, retention development, and implementation. The sample consisted of 200 students (100 primary and 100 secondary) from public schools in Bangkok’s Thonburi district, using a multi-level group research design. Data collection instruments included the instructional toolkit, achievement tests, questionnaires, and interviews. Data were gathered before, during, and after the intervention, and analyzed using both quantitative (SPSS) and qualitative (content analysis) methods. The research revealed that 95 percent of students and teachers acknowledged the toolkit’s efficiency and efficacy, with significant improvements noted post-intervention. The toolkit effectively enhanced knowledge retention in verb tense structures across different educational levels, showing particular resonance with higher-grade students and those at intermediate proficiency. Practical implications of the findings include 1) the need for school policies to mandate OBE-aligned toolkits with age-appropriate designs, and 2) the importance of incorporating self-paced, practical language application opportunities for Thai EFL students. This study contributes to discourses on instructional innovation in EFL contexts by underscoring tailored toolkits’ potential to address specific linguistic challenges while aligning with educational reforms. Future research could explore adaptability across age groups, design variations, and other complex linguistic elements.

Abstract: Purpose It is largely acknowledged that arbitrating the flow of knowledge can help firms strategically leverage tacit and explicit internal knowledge. However, despite the apparent scholarly and managerial acceptance of the criticality of the flow of knowledge between various stakeholders, the academic understanding of knowledge arbitrage remains coarse-grained. There are practically no empirical insights available to unravel the consequences of firms’ knowledge arbitrage choices regarding rewards and risks. This study aims to identify the risks that emerge as firms channel the flow of knowledge from surplus to deficit areas within organizational boundaries. To this end, the authors investigate several subsumed subprocesses in knowledge arbitrage to map the associated risks. Design/methodology/approach This study used an exploratory qualitative approach to examine the risks that emerge as firms attempt to support knowledge flows within their organizational boundaries. The data were collected through open-ended essays via an online research platform from 45 full-time employees of firms operating in different sectors. The collected data were analyzed inductively through open, axial and selective coding. Findings The research findings identified three key subprocesses of knowledge arbitrage: knowledge diffusion, knowledge brokering and knowledge absorption. These subprocesses are susceptible to various risks arising the form of channels, champions, sharers and receivers of knowledge flows. In general, the study showed that a firm’s decision regarding knowledge flows, such as structured or random flows, or the presence or absence of designated coordinators to broker the flow carries specific risks for both sharers and receivers. In particular, while the risks of knowledge hiding, misinformation and disinformation manifest in all three subprocesses, low employee engagement, loss of knowledge and information overload also emerged as key risks in any two of the three subprocesses. Originality/value This study offers valuable insights by uncovering the hitherto unexplored risks in intrafirm knowledge arbitrage. Given that knowledge is a crucial organizational tool for driving performance, innovation and competitive advantage, understanding the risks associated with intrafirm arbitrated knowledge flows can help firms anticipate and mitigate the associated adverse consequences. The findings make a novel contribution by offering (a) a comprehensive categorization of the risks associated with knowledge arbitrage rooted in processes, people and structures and (b) a macro overview of knowledge arbitrage risks associated with the processes of knowledge diffusion, knowledge brokering and knowledge absorption.

Abstract: Background: The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have set ambitious hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination targets for 2030. Current estimates show that the United States is not on pace to meet elimination targets due to multiple patient, clinic, institutional, and societal level barriers that contribute to HCV testing and treatment gaps. Among these barriers are unawareness of testing and treatment needs, misinformation concerning adverse treatment reactions, need for substance use sobriety, and treatment efficacy. Strategies to improve viral hepatitis education are needed. Objective: We aim to provide a high-quality HCV educational app for patients and health care workers, particularly nonprescriber staff. The app was vetted by health care providers and designed to guide users through the HCV testing and treatment stages in a self-exploratory way to promote engagement and knowledge retention. The app is comprised of five learning modules: (1) Testing for Hep C (hepatitis C), (2) Tests for Hep C Positive Patients, (3) Treatments Available to You, (4) What to Expect During Treatment, and (5) What to Expect After Treatment. Methods: An HCV knowledge assessment survey was administered to providers and patients at the Yale School of Medicine and 11 Connecticut HIV clinics as part of a grant-funded activity. The survey findings and pilot testing feedback guided the app’s design and content development. Data on app usage from November 2019 to November 2022 were analyzed, focusing on user demographics, engagement metrics, and module usage patterns. Results: There were 561 app users; 216 (38.5%) accessed the training modules of which 151 (69.9%) used the app for up to 60 minutes. Of them, 65 (30.1%) users used it for >60 minutes with a median time spent of 5 (IQR 2-8) minutes; the median time between initial accession and last use was 39 (IQR 18-60) days. Users accessed one or more modules and followed a nonsequential pattern of use: module 1: 163 (75.4%) users; module 4: 82 (38%); module 5: 67 (31%); module 3: 49 (22.7%); module 2: 41 (19%). Conclusions: This app, created in an academic setting, is one of a few available in English and Spanish that provides content-vetted HCV education for patients and health care supportive staff. It offers the convenience of on-demand education, allowing users to access crucial information about HCV management and treatment in a self-directed fashion that acknowledges and promotes variable preferences in learning approaches. While app uptake was relatively limited, we propose that future efforts should focus on combined promotion efforts with marketing strategies experts aligned with academic experts. Incorporating ongoing user feedback and integrating personalized reminders and quizzes, will further enhance engagement, supporting the broader public health HCV elimination goals.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the effects of Storytelling Narrated Videos (SNV) on students' knowledge retention and transferability. A total of 56 students from a university in Indonesia were randomly assigned to a quasi-experimental research design exposed to SNV and to Lecture Narrated Videos (LNV). Two videos were created to deliver content on Bloom's Taxonomy, one using a lecture-style format and the other adopting a storytelling approach. Data were collected through tests, questionnaires, and essays. The findings revealed that participants exposed to SNV had higher retention memory scores, indicating a positive impact on knowledge retention compared to those who watched LNV. Moreover, the storytelling videos facilitated cognitive skill progression, enhanced understanding through engaging visuals, and fostered a strong connection with a familiar narrator, resulting in a more dynamic and memorable learning experience. The study also examined knowledge transfer and found that participants who watched the storytelling videos performed better in applying Bloom's Taxonomy concepts to planning teaching objectives in the essay test. This suggests that the incorporation of storytelling narration and promoting transfer knowledge activities can enhance students' understanding, retention, and practical application of the learned material. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of incorporating storytelling in narrated videos to improve students' knowledge retention, transferability, and engagement in educational settings.

Abstract: Knowledge maps are teaching tools that can promote deeply learning and avoid knowledge loss by helping students plan learning paths. Mining potential association rules of concepts from student exercise data was a common method to construct knowledge maps automatically. While manual conditions should be set to filter the association rules future to improve the accuracy of knowledge maps, which made the construction of the knowledge map can not automatic totally. So, the study proposed a knowledge map construction method that combined knowledge tracking and association rule mining expanding with interaction frequencies based on exercise data to achieve rules cleaning automatically. The method first predicted students' knowledge mastery sequences by a deep knowledge tracking model and discovered clustering relations to represent potential structures between concepts by fuzzy cluster analysis. Meanwhile, the method investigated association rule mining expanding with interaction frequencies to discover association rules between concepts. Finally, the clustering relations were used to filter the mined association rules automatically. To verify the effectiveness of the method, we constructed a knowledge map based on 34,350 online exercise data of 117 students in a computer programming course.

Abstract: Aim/Purpose: The study seeks to utilize Augmented Reality (AR) in creating virtual laboratories for engineering education, focusing on enhancing teaching methodologies to facilitate student understanding of intricate and theoretical engineering principles while also assessing engineering students' acceptance of such laboratories. Background: AR, a part of next-generation technology, has enhanced the perception of reality by overlaying virtual elements in the physical environment. The utilization of AR is prevalent across different disciplines, yet its efficacy in facilitating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is limited. Engineering studies, a part of STEM learning, involves complex and abstract concepts like machine simulation, structural analysis, and design optimization; these things would be easy to grasp with the help of AR. This restriction can be attributed to their innovative characteristics and disparities. Therefore, providing a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the acceptance of these technologies by students -- the primary target demographic -- and examining the impact of these factors is essential to maximize the advantages of AR while refining the implementation processes. Methodology: The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a tool that enriches the educational experience within engineering laboratories. Utilizing Unity game engine libraries, digital content is meticulously crafted for this tool and subsequently integrated with geo-location functionalities. The tool's user-friendly interface allows both faculty and non-faculty members of the academic institution to establish effortlessly the virtual laboratory. Subsequently, an assessment of the tool is conducted through the application of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, involving the administration of surveys to university students to gauge their level of adaptability. Contribution: The utilization of interactive augmented learning in laboratory settings enables educational establishments to realize notable savings in time and resources, thereby achieving sustainable educational outcomes. The study is of great importance due to its utilization of student behavioral intentions as the underlying framework for developing an AR tool and illustrating the impact of learner experience on various objectives and the acceptance of AR in Engineering studies. Furthermore, the research results enable educational institutions to implement AR-based virtual laboratories to improve student experiences strategically, align with learner objectives, and ultimately boost the adaptability of AR technologies. Findings: Drawing on practice-based research, the authors showcase work samples and a digital project of AR-based Virtual labs to illustrate the evaluation of the adaptability of AR technology. Adaptability is calculated by conducting a survey of 300 undergraduate university students from different engineering departments and applying an adaptability method to determine the behavioral intentions of students. Recommendations for Practitioners: Engineering institutions could leverage research findings in the implementation of AR to enhance the effectiveness of AR technology in practical education settings. Recommendation for Researchers: The authors implement a pragmatic research framework aimed at integrating AR technology into virtual AR-based labs for engineering education. This study delves into a unique perspective within the realm of engineering studies, considering students' perspectives and discerning their behavioral intentions by drawing upon previous research on technology utilization. The research employs various objectives and learner experiences to assess their influence on students' acceptance of AR technology. Impact on Society: The use of AR in engineering institutions, especially in laboratory practicals, has a significant impact on society, supported by the UTAUT2 model. UTAUT2 model assesses factors like performance, effort expectancy, social influence, and conditions, showing that AR in education is feasible and adaptable. This adaptability helps students and educators incorporate AR tools effectively for better educational results. AR-based labs allow students to interact with complex engineering concepts in immersive settings, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention. This interactive augmented learning for laboratories saves educational institutions significant time and resources, attaining sustainable learning. Future Research: Further research can employ a more comprehensive acceptance model to examine learners' adaptability to AR technology and try comparing different adaptability models to determine which is more effective for engineering students.

Abstract: The study was proposed to investigate the effect of a technology-integrated guided inquiry-based learning (TGIBL) and guided inquiry (GIBL) approach on preservice mathematics teachers' (PSMTs') plane geometry learning. For this purpose, pre-posttest non-equivalent quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 116 PSMTs within three intact groups: Group1 (48) treated with TGIBL, Group2 (38) with GIBL and Group3 (30) in conventional approach. A two-tiered geometry diagnostic test and a geometry procedural knowledge test were used to collect the data and their reliability were KR20 = 0.87 and ICC = 0.88, respectively. The data were analyzed through a paired sample t-test and a one-way MANOVA. According to the findings, there is statistically significant difference between the groups, that is PSMTs taught with technology-integrated guided inquiry significantly outperformed than other groups. Therefore, the integration of technology and guided inquiry must be considered by teachers' educators as a pedagogical strategy to enhance the learning experience and knowledge retention among pre-service teachers at college of teachers' education.

Abstract: Student learning in simple electric circuits has been an important area in physics education research. This study builds off a previous investigation that applied the conceptual framework model to examine knowledge integration in student learning of simple electric circuits and developed a multiple-choice concept test for assessing knowledge integration in simple electric circuits. In this study, a conceptual-framework-based teaching intervention was developed and implemented in a controlled study with high school students in China to evaluate the effectiveness of the new instruction. Using the instrument developed in the previous study, a pretest, a post-test, and a delayed post-test were conducted with both groups of students. The delayed post-test was included to further evaluate knowledge retention as evidence of knowledge integration. The results suggest that the conceptual-framework-based teaching intervention was effective in promoting knowledge integration compared to the existing instruction.

Abstract: Background: Educational multimedia is a cost-effective and straightforward way to administer large-scale information interventions to patient populations in musculoskeletal health care. While an abundance of health research informs the content of these interventions, less guidance exists about optimizing their design. Objective: This study aims to identify randomized controlled trials of patient populations with musculoskeletal conditions that used multimedia-based patient educational materials (PEMs) and examine how design was reported and impacted patients’ knowledge and rehabilitation outcomes. Design was evaluated using principles from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML). Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched from inception to September 2023 for studies examining adult patients with musculoskeletal conditions receiving multimedia PEMs compared to any other interventions. The primary outcome was knowledge retention measured via test scores. Secondary outcomes were any patient-reported measures. Retrievability was noted, and PEMs were sourced through search, purchase, and author communication. Results: A total of 160 randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion: 13 (8.1%) included their educational materials and 31 (19.4%) required a web search, purchase, or direct requests for educational materials. Of these 44 (27.5%) studies, none fully optimized the design of their educational materials, particularly lacking in the CTML principles of coherence, redundancy, modality, and generative activities for the learner. Of the 160 studies, the remaining 116 (72.5%) contained interventions that could not be retrieved or appraised. Learning was evaluated in 5 (3.1%) studies. Conclusions: Musculoskeletal studies should use open science principles and provide their PEMs wherever possible. The link between providing multimedia PEMs and patient learning is largely unexamined, but engagement potential may be maximized when considering design principles such as the CTML.

Abstract: Retaining an employee's knowledge becomes a significant challenge when skilled and experienced employees leave an organization. Human resources (HR) professionals/leaders at public and private universities are particularly concerned about the detrimental impact of knowledge loss in such cases. Grounded in the knowledge management cycle (KMC) model, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore strategies that HR professionals/leaders of public and private universities use to enhance employee knowledge retention. The participants were nine HR professionals/leaders in public and private universities who successfully enhanced employee knowledge retention. Data were collected using semistructured interviews and a review of publicly available company documentation. Through thematic analysis, four themes were identified: (a) mentoring and coaching, (b) creating a culture of learning and development, (c) employee engagement culture, and (d) effective knowledge repository system. A key recommendation for HR professionals/leaders is to create an environment of trust, openness, and excellent relationships with the university’s employees. The implications for positive social include the potential for HR professionals/leaders at public and private universities to drive competitive advantage and business growth, enhance employee well-being, and expand job opportunities and sustainability in local communities.

Abstract: This study examined the impact of a pedagogy that is culturally influenced and laced with technological and contextual elements known as the culturo-techno-contextual approach (CTCA) on promoting knowledge retention of biology concepts. The research design was mixed methods, and the sample consisted of 88 senior secondary school II students selected from two Lagos State educational district V schools in Nigeria. Quantitative data was collected using the Variation and Evolution Achievement Test with a reliability value of 0.79, while qualitative data was collected using the Students’ Perception of CTCA Interview Guide. All students in the two sample schools used for the experimental and control groups took a pretest before treatment, a posttest at the end of the treatment phase, and a retention test four weeks later. The ANCOVA output demonstrated a statistically significant difference in knowledge retention [F (1,85) = 134.50; p < .05]. This suggests that experimental students retained more.

Abstract: Purpose   Sonography training has become an important part of university medicine courses. This study explores the impact of digital and analog teaching resources on learning outcomes, knowledge retention, and student preferences and motivation in a flipped classroom setting. Materials and Methods   This prospective controlled study involving two groups of third-year medical students included a voluntary three-day compact ultrasound course given in a flipped classroom, comprising 26 teaching units of 45 minutes each. Hardcopy lecture notes (control group) and E-learning (study group) were used as teaching resources. Evaluations were conducted before (pre) and during the preparation phase (intermediate), and after (post) the face-to-face course. Likert scale responses, written theory tests with very short answer questions (Theorypre, Theoryinter, Theorypost), and practical examinations (Practiceinter, Practicepost) were used for student self-assessment and to measure attitude, motivation, as well as theoretical and practical skills. Results   A total of N=236 complete data sets (study group n=136; control group n=100) were analyzed. Both groups showed an equivalent initial level of, and a continuous and significant (p<0.01) increase in, subjective and objective skills over the evaluated time frame. The study group achieved significantly (p<0.05) better results in Theoryinter, Theorypost, Practiceinter, and Practicepost. The study group evaluated their teaching resource and the training concept significantly (p<0.05) better. Conclusion   The integration of digital resources into sonography education provides comparable learning outcomes to traditional analog materials, enhancing the preparatory phase. In the future, digitally supported training should be used more.Purpose   Sonography training has become an important part of university medicine courses.

Abstract: Indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants is vital to local communities and cultural heritage, particularly in Ethiopia. This study aims to document native medicinal plants in the Jawi district, including associated traditional knowledge. The study involved conducting semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and guided field walks with a purposefully selected 54 traditional healers. The study identified 87 medicinal plant species from 50 families used treat over 50 ailments, with a preference for wild herbs. Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Solanaceae were the most prominent families, each with five species; Zehneria scabra , was the most often mentioned species, followed by Lepidium sativum , Myrica salicifolia , Carissa spinarum , and Momordica foetida . 43% of identified species were herbs, with 44% of remedies made from roots. Pounding was the most common preparation method, and oral application was the most frequent use, followed by dermal application. 60% plants treated human ailments, 16% treated livestock, and 24% were used for both. Preference rankings indicated specific plants favored for certain ailments. The study highlights key plant families and species crucial for local healthcare but notes threats like habitat destruction and knowledge loss. Urgent conservation actions are needed to preserve medicinal plants and inform future research and strategies.

Abstract: Videoconferencing was heavily utilized as an online learning tool at universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the high utilization, few studies have examined students' perspectives on their health, social interaction, and preferences in using specific videoconferencing features for online pedagogy and campus participation. This study surveyed 275 occupational therapy students from six class cohorts regarding the use of videoconferencing during the 2020-2021 academic year. Students reported physical changes in fatigue, eye, and back discomfort from the use of videoconferencing for extended periods, in addition to increased stress and anxiety during this period. Students reported lower class engagement during videoconferencing, as indicated by less frequency of asking/answering questions, paying attention, participating in breakout rooms with unfamiliar peers, and less motivation to attend classes. While students preferred in-person versus videoconferencing for overall classroom engagement and knowledge retention, preferences were equivocal for use of videoconferencing in meeting with professors, peer tutoring, group projects, and office hours. A benefit to videoconferencing availability was the ability to maintain social communication with friends and family, particularly for undergraduates. Comparisons among class cohorts are presented.

Abstract: Abundant research has tried to understand how games can be designed and used effectively to improve the learning process and to examine the correlations between digital learning games and student motivation, engagement, and knowledge retention. The current study examined the correlation between learning through digital game-based learning (DGBL) and students' achievements, their sense of involvement, and motivation for learning. Using a quantitative approach, data was drawn from questionnaires and exams in two subjects: literature and language. Participants were 320 male and female students aged 12-14 attending a single middle school participated in the study. The students were randomly divided into three groups, each group was given a unique teaching and learning method. Group 1 studied and practiced using the traditional method (a teacher who teaches in the classroom and worksheets for practice), Group 2 studied with the traditional method but practiced with a digital game and Group 3 learned and practiced using a digital game. The findings showed that the students' attained significantly higher achievements in the group that was taught traditionally but practiced with a digital game. It was also found that when digital learning games are integrated into teaching and learning, the students' motivation and involvement in the class increased.

Abstract: Retrieval-based learning, using tests for content review, frequently proves more effective for knowledge retention compared to alternative methods. Extensive research has explored this with older students, often in contrast to more passive techniques like rereading or note rewriting, typically focusing on vocabulary content, in non-classroom settings and assessing knowledge retention within a week. In this study we conducted a classroom experiment to compare the efficacy of retrieval-based learning to another active method of reviewing content, namely discussion, in promoting long-term knowledge retention among primary school science students. Additionally, we assessed the students' perceptions of these reviewing methods. A total of eighty-one primary school students participated in the study, which encompassed a lesson conducted at a zoo, followed by a review of the lesson content using either retrieval-based learning or discussion. Our findings indicated no impact of the method of reviewing on knowledge retention after either one week or four weeks. Nevertheless, notable effects were observed in terms of motivation, as students who employed retrieval-based learning for reviewing reported heightened levels of interest and enjoyment, along with perceiving greater benefits from the process. Additionally, boys in the discussion group reported increased curiosity, in contrast to girls who reported an inverse pattern.

Abstract: This dissertation examines the impact of outdoor learning, including constructivist theories on student development in natural resource curricula. It highlights the importance of experiential, hands-on learning that connects students with nature. This approach challenges traditional methods by exploring active participation and sensory-rich experiences to enhance comprehension, critical thinking, and knowledge retention capabilities. The research explores the practical benefits of integrating nature-centric pedagogical approaches into a natural resource-based curriculum. Empirical evidence shows that outdoor environments, like forests, can alleviate stress, boost creativity, and foster a deeper connection with nature. These settings enhance student motivation, engagement, and material retention while aiding personal development in decision-making, teamwork, and leadership. This study focuses on the Idaho Natural Resources Camp (NRC), an immersive program educating youth about natural resource management through hands-on experiences. Using pre- and post-assessments over seven years, the study evaluates the camp's effectiveness in enhancing participants' knowledge and retention. The findings show significant improvements in understanding and skills, indicating that extended, immersive outdoor programs positively impact environmental knowledge and behavior. Early exposure to nature is crucial in shaping environmental perspectives and behaviors. Nature-based outdoor education programs are vital for nurturing environmentally literate individuals. This research highlights outdoor education's transformative potential to foster holistic development and environmental appreciation. Extended experiential programs like the NRC are essential for cultivating environmentally conscious citizens and future leaders in natural resource management.

Abstract: Throughout the evolution of biomedical and engineering education, teachers and students have experimented with various forms of learning platforms and techniques in hopes of enhancing the learning experience. However, these efforts have not always been interactive, leading to student burnout, disengagement, decreased knowledge retention, and lower grades. To tackle this issue, I propose a method to improve both Anatomy and Physiology education. Students can learn biomedical science as well as other engineering educational topics with a more interactive experience using our proposed method via AR device, i.e., HoloLens 2. This project used an exploratory method, which involves conducting user studies using HoloLens 2 as a medium to teach students course-related topics. This method is based on a Student-Centered Learning pedagogy and allows students to walk through course materials with different paths and paces based on the students’ preferences, allowing us to investigate the relationship between information retention and the AR platform. Said user studies are conducted to collect qualitative data about students’ learning outcomes and their opinions on our proposed method. Through user studies, I recruited 30 students to take part in the lesson plans created and curated by professors in The Brody School of Medicine and by Dr. Elizabeth Jones at East Carolina University. Students are given quizzes before taking part to test knowledge of the subjects that they have not been introduced to before and then are allowed to tackle modules at their own pace. They are then given the option to attempt modules at their discretion. This is due to the lesson plan being designed as a tree, with multiple pathways that can be navigated either upward or downwards depending on whether they have completed the prerequisite module. After studying the lessons provided, they are given a virtual quiz to test the knowledge that they have gained while using the device. When calculating the averages of both assessments, students on average had an improvement of 10 percent in scores after using our proposed method compared to the quiz scores collected before using the device. They were also given a survey on their thoughts concerning using the HoloLens 2 device after finishing the study where 96 percent of students believe that the tools and techniques from augmented reality are both exciting and would find it useful in the study of other disciplines. 90 percent of students also found that both listening and conversational skills are frequently utilized while using Augmented Reality.

Abstract: Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technologies are revolutionizing educational experiences, but their widespread adoption hinges on addressing critical security and usability challenges, particularly in the domain of user authentication. This research presents an investigation into the security landscape of AR/VR and explores a graphical authentication scheme called “Things” that enhances both security and usability in immersive learning environments. Through a systematic evaluation of popular AR/VR devices and applications, potential vulnerabilities and limitations were identified, such as high usage of pin/passwords which are susceptible to shoulder-surfing attacks, lack of multi-factor authentication, and unclear data-sharing practices. A review of existing knowledge-based authentication schemes revealed a scarcity of shoulder-surfing-resistant methods suitable for AR/VR. Subsequent technical evaluations and user studies validated the effectiveness, memorability, and user acceptance of the “Things” scheme, which employs familiar object images for authentication. The replication study conducted in AR and VR environments demonstrated the scheme’s superior performance on the Valve Index VR platform compared to the Microsoft HoloLens AR device. Interestingly, integrating the “Things” scheme into a VR classroom setting resulted in high authentication success rates, low perceived workload, and improved knowledge retention among participants. Our study aims to address the security and usability challenges of authentication in AR/VR, we contribute to the responsible development and adoption of immersive technologies in education, paving the way for secure and engaging learning experiences.

Abstract: Dental education assumes an indispensable role in adequately equipping students for a successful career in dentistry. Error-based active learning, an innovative approach in dental education, is a combination of mistake-driven learning (MDL) and case-based learning (CBL) to provide a transformative learning atmosphere for students. While active learning has gained popularity in dental education, the effectiveness of error-based active learning remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of error-based active learning among final-year dental undergraduate students in comparison with the conventional lecture-based approach. INTRODUCTION Dental education assumes an indispensable role in adequately equipping students for a successful career in dentistry. Error-based active learning, an innovative approach in dental education, is a combination of mistake-driven learning (MDL) and case-based learning (CBL) to provide a transformative learning atmosphere for students. While active learning has gained popularity in dental education, the effectiveness of error-based active learning remains unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of error-based active learning among final-year dental undergraduate students in comparison with the conventional lecture-based approach.A parallel-arm single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in a dental institute in India from November 2022 to December 2022. A total of 74 students were randomly allocated to two groups: Group A ( n = 37) received error-based active learning and group B ( n = 37) received conventional lecture-based learning approach. Atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) was chosen as the topic for the study. The knowledge of students was assessed at three intervals: baseline, post-intervention, and 4 weeks after the intervention, using a self-designed and validated questionnaire with Cronbach's alpha of 0.87 and a content validity ratio of 0.84. A standard survey questionnaire was employed to evaluate students' perceptions of the teaching methods.

A standard survey questionnaire was employed to evaluate students' perceptions of the teaching methods.Error-based active learning group outperformed the lecture-based group significantly in the post-intervention test (20.92 ± 1.42 vs 16.97 ± 3.06), with better knowledge retention (18.30 ± 2.02 vs 14.05 ± 4.26) and positive feedback from the students. RESULTS Error-based active learning group outperformed the lecture-based group significantly in the post-intervention test (20.92 ± 1.42 vs 16.97 ± 3.06), with better knowledge retention (18.30 ± 2.02 vs 14.05 ± 4.26) and positive feedback from the students.The error-based active learning approach proved superior to the conventional lecture-based method in enhancing and retaining knowledge regarding ART. CONCLUSIONS The error-based active learning approach proved superior to the conventional lecture-based method in enhancing and retaining knowledge regarding ART.

Abstract: Delaware is ranked in the top 10 states with the highest prevalence of Lyme disease (Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, 2023). This research aimed to evaluate the effects of teaching a program created by the researcher, Blast Away Ticks (BAT), for preventing Lyme disease. The program used 12 prevention techniques from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2023a) and a mnemonic device called BLAST—bathe, look, apply, spray, and treat—from the Town of Ridgefield (2023). The researcher conducted a pilot study with a quasi-experimental methodology and collected data from Cub Scout Pack 1 in Lewes, Delaware, among children aged 8 through 11, where she evaluated knowledge retention scores and behavior outcomes. The researcher evaluated the study using two pre- and post-questionnaires: Quantitative Test I, to evaluate knowledge, and Quantitative Test II, using a Likert-scale to evaluate behaviors. The results showed that the participants gained knowledge from an increase in the number of correct answers after completing the BAT program. Although previous studies showed that Lyme disease prevention techniques led to behavioral changes, results from this study showed no statistical significance in proving or disproving the effect of changed behaviors after teaching BAT.

Abstract: Introduction: As the nurse anesthesia profession continues to grow, the complexity of the required skills has remained, if not increased. Education is pivotal in future providers’ success, specifically in the simulation setting where hands-on skills are taught/learned. Society has entered a technological era that has forced education programs to adapt to new teaching methods such as video simulation. There is, however, a gap in knowledge on the effects of video simulation on learning outcomes in novice nurse anesthesia learners. Methods: This randomized, single-blind, experimental research study evaluated video-simulated learning compared to traditional classroom learning and its impact on knowledge retention when performing an ultrasound (US)-guided central venous catheter insertion in novice nurse anesthesia students. The sample included first-year students enrolled in the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice Program at Webster University. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the traditional group (TG) and the video group (VG). Both groups received the same content; however, the TG received a two-hour in-person lecture from a professor, while the VG received four videos. The participants were evaluated for knowledge retention and skills performance nine weeks after initial exposure with a skills checkoff. Results: There were a total of 24 participants (N=24) divided into two groups: the TG (n=12) and the VG (n=12). Eight participants received a passing score, and four received a failing score in the TG. Seven participants received a passing score, and five received a failing score in the VG (p=1.000). The mean score for the TG was 12.00, and for the VG was 11.75 (p-value=0.904). Discussion: There was no statistically significant difference between traditional and video simulation learning methods when evaluating knowledge retention for US-guided central venous catheter insertion. This study suggests video simulation is as effective as traditional classroom learning when learning hands-on skills.

Abstract: Background: The misuse and overuse of antibiotics accelerate the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Serious games, any form of games that serve a greater purpose other than entertainment, could augment public education above ongoing health promotion efforts. Hence, we developed an evidence-based educational serious game app—SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence—to educate players on good antibiotic use practices and AMR through a game quest comprising 3 minigames and interaction with the nonplayer characters. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence app in improving the knowledge of, attitude toward, and perceptions (KAP) of appropriate antibiotic use and AMR among the public in Singapore. Methods: We conducted a 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial, recruiting visitors aged 18-65 years from 2 polyclinics in Singapore. Intervention group participants had to download the SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence app (available only in English and on the Android platform) on their smartphones and complete the quest in the app. Participants took half a day to 2 weeks to complete the quest. The control group received no intervention. Knowledge questions on antibiotic use and AMR (11 binary questions) were self-administered at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 6-10 weeks post intervention, while attitudes and perception questions (14 three-point Likert-scale questions) were self-administered at baseline and 6-10 weeks post intervention. We also collected participants’ feedback on app usage. Results: Participants (n=348; intervention: n=142, control: n=206) had a mean age of 36.9 years. Intervention group participants showed a statistically significant improvement in mean knowledge score (effect size: 0.58 [95% CI 0.28-0.87]) compared with controls after accounting for age, educational level, and exposure to advertisements on antibiotics and AMR. Intervention participants also showed a statistically significant improvement in mean attitude-perception scores (effect size: 0.98 (95% CI 0.44-1.52)) after adjusting for marital status and race. A majority of participants agreed that the “SteWARdS Antibiotic Defence” app improved their awareness on antibiotic use (135/142, 95.1%) and AMR (136/142, 95.8%). About 73.9% (105/142) of the participants agreed that the app is easy to use, 70.4% (100/142) agreed that the app was enjoyable, and 85.2% (121/142) would recommend the app to others. Conclusions: Our educational serious game app improves participants’ KAP on appropriate antibiotic use and AMR. Public education apps should be engaging, educational, easy to use, and have an attractive user interface. Future research should assess the effectiveness of interventions in facilitating long-term knowledge retention and long-lasting behavioral change.

Abstract: When instructing very large groups of students in science, it can be difficult to engage all students in the content and measure their understanding. A major unaddressed challenge in science instruction is how specifically to design and implement strategies that engender active learning particularly in high-enrollment undergraduate courses. Active learning, which represents a diverse set of strategies, may include student engagement as part of instruction through discussions, active movement, and application (Bernstein, 2018; Cavanagh, et al. 2016; Michael, 2006 & Wilke, 2003). This study was designed to provide data addressing the gap in the literature regarding how the continual implementation of several active learning strategies in a large enrollment undergraduate Human Physiology class impacts students. I chose three active learning modalities for this study from Bernstein (2018) -- kinesthetic and movement, discussion, and problem-based learning and assigned each to units of study during the semester on a rotating basis so that the learning modality not the unit of study could be studied. This project specifically targeted students’ perceptions of learning through the three modalities and students’ retention of targeted content in Human Physiology. Students responded to an end of semester survey and evaluation on how their learning was impacted. A second research component analyzed students’ performance on summative exams under different active learning modalities to provide a comparative analysis across modalities and duration of the study. I found that students were overwhelmingly positive toward participating in these active learning environments and found these activities to be enjoyable and improve cognizance. In survey responses, students reported that active learning improved their knowledge retention and confidence in understanding the content. Students enjoyed and retained information and improved content retention leading to improved examination performance when taught with kinesthetic methods.

Abstract: Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) have worse health outcomes than heterosexual, cisgender individuals due to a heteronormative, cisgendered society that has created inequitable access to healthcare and increased health disparities. In 2014, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) published guidelines to facilitate implementation of SGM health content and institutional climate changes to reduce the burden of health disparities and increase medical student competence treating SGM patients, however, no publication to date has assessed the efforts of medical schools to implement these guidelines. Sensitivity and cultural training of medical students is imperative to increase comfort, knowledge retention, and clinical skill acumen to increase accessibility to and quality of healthcare, and to decrease and eliminate SGM health inequities. This research study examined SGM health inequities and investigated culturally responsive best practices for implementing an inclusive SGM curriculum in U.S. medical schools. Through a survey of medical schools in the U.S. assessing the efforts of medical schools to adopt the AAMC SGM curricula and climate change guidelines, the study explored the total hours of SGM content taught, the competencies that were included in the curriculum, if assessment of SGM content was occurring, and what resources were available and needed for both faculty and students of medical schools. The results show an increase in overall hours of SGM content taught (from 5 hours in 2011 to 8.9 hours in 2021), however, SGM content and competencies are inconsistently implemented across medical schools. The study also shows there is limited information on student assessment and SGM content efficacy with only 23% of respondents performing assessment. This further reinforces the need for comprehensive SGM curricula that empowers medical students and future physicians to accurately and comfortably treat SGM patients. This study contributes to improving healthcare quality and access for SGM individuals as the results indicate that while there has been progress in SGM rights over the past several decades, healthcare education and practice lag in ensuring and inclusive medical education for students, which prevents equal access and quality healthcare for the SGM community.

Abstract: This study explores the impact of an innovative approach that combines artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot support with collaborative note-taking (CNT) in the comprehension of semantic terms among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. Given the significance of semantics in English language learning, traditional didactic methods often present challenges for EFL learners. The proposed AI chatbot-supported approach aims to foster learner interaction, while the CNT strategy focuses on enhancing knowledge retention and engagement with learning materials. Conducted as a quasiexperimental pre-test-post-test design, the study involved 60 English language and literature majors from a non-English-speaking area enrolled at a private university. Participants were divided into the AI chatbot-supported and CNT (AI-CNT) group and the conventional CNT (cCNT) group. Results indicated that the AI-CNT group outperformed the cCNT group across various dimensions of semantic learning outcomes, including performance, achievement, self-efficacy, metacognition, and anxiety reduction. This study highlights the potential of integrating AI chatbot support and the CNT strategy to significantly enhance the EFL semantic learning experience. The personalized and interaction-based linguistic practices, enriched with feedback and emotional support, offer a promising avenue for advancing language learning outcomes in the digital age.

Abstract: In an immersive virtual reality (IVR) environment, this study investigated: (1) the role of learner characteristics in various learning and psychological outcomes, including knowledge retention, perceived learning, cognitive load, self-efficacy, enjoyment, presence, and usefulness; and (2) the relationship among these intended outcomes. Forty adult participants experienced an IVR nature trail tour involving science learning topics, followed by a knowledge test and multiple surveys. Multivariate analysis of covariance results indicated age by gender interaction effects on perceived presence and usefulness as well as an age by IVR prior experience interaction effect on perceived presence. Additionally, multiple correlational relationships were detected among the intended outcomes. This study contributes to the limited research on the role of learner characteristics in STEM learning and psychological outcomes in IVR environments.

Abstract: In today's world, technology plays a significant role in shaping our daily interactions and how we connect with the world. The rapid advancements in technology have influenced many sectors, particularly education, where integrating technology is now seen as essential rather than just a luxury. As a result, the education field has adapted over time to keep up with innovations and their potential to improve the teaching and learning environment. The incorporation of technology into education has evolved from introducing computer systems in classrooms to the adoption of smartboards, tablets, and e-learning platforms. The rise of Virtual Reality (VR) technology has also opened up possibilities for hands-on learning experiences that allow students to explore and practice skills in ways that traditional teaching methods cannot. VR technology enables students to interact with content in a way that fosters a sense of presence and immersion, which can improve knowledge retention. In fields, like science, engineering, medicine, arts, and language learning, VR applications have shown promise in boosting student engagement and enhancing skills within a controlled learning environment. However, the widespread adoption of VR technology in education faces challenges. One significant obstacle is the cost of acquiring VR equipment and software which can strain budgets. Additionally, the availability of high-quality content for VR platforms poses a barrier for educators seeking to integrate VR into their teaching practices. This article delves into the use of Virtual Reality in education, and how VR can influence student learning outcomes in applications such as medicine, science, arts and language learning. Apart from the advantages of VR, the article also discusses the obstacles that are impeding the use of VR in education including concerns about costs, standardizing content and the necessity for training and support for educators. As VR technology advances and becomes widely available, it stands ready to revolutionize the landscape by offering learning opportunities that were previously beyond imagination. Through this technology, education can introduce a world of possibilities that nurture curiosity, creativity and a lifelong enthusiasm for learning.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) and emotionally resonant videos on knowledge retention for adult learners at a contractor safety training organization supporting the energy industry. The intent of this research was to determine if traditional computer-based training (CBT) can be made more effective with the addition of VR exercises with emotionally resonant videos. The two experimental groups were exposed to either CBTs augmented by VR exercises that reinforced the CBT course learning objectives and included work-relevant videos designed to arouse an emotional response or CBTs with VR exercises without videos. The control group for this research took the same CBT course without VR exercises and without videos. A quantitative analysis was performed on data collected from a follow-up quiz delivered three days after the completion of the course(s). Data from this follow-up quiz was analyzed to determine if there was greater knowledge retention of the course learning objectives and procedures among the experimental groups than among the control group. The results found a non-statistically significant relationship between the groups, however, trends between the groups show that there are benefits for transfer of learning when using VR and VR with emotionally resonant videos compared to those groups without these tools. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the results, when considering aspects of the participants' demographic and experience variables, suggests that the recall quiz results may have been affected by an increased cognitive load on younger and inexperienced participants.

Abstract: The transfer of training from learning environments to workplace environments has been a major concern for training professionals and researchers for decades. How should organizations evaluate the effectiveness of their training programs and what impacts are those programs having on their employees' on-the-job performance? These questions are particularly relevant in an age of e-learning courses because many organizations are looking for practical ways to support the transfer of the knowledge and skills employees learn during training to real-world contexts. To address this issue, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of an online transfer intervention (Transfer e-Booster) designed to measure and promote training transfer. A total of 53 volunteers (control n = 25, experimental n = 28) at a non-profit organization participated in the study by completing an e-learning course about emergency preparedness. Following the e-learning course, participants in the experimental group interacted with an online transfer intervention and completed an experience survey. The study measured two aspects of training transfer: knowledge retention and behavioral application. In addition, participants in the experimental group rated their perceptions of the intervention's main design components: key identified behaviors, knowledge retention questions, behavioral application self-assessment, and peer sharing. Four weeks after the e-learning course, all participants completed a post-test. The results of the experiment yielded mixed results. Participants in the experimental group earned significantly higher knowledge retention scores. They also earned higher behavioral application scores, but the difference was not significant. In terms of their perceptions of the online transfer intervention, participants rated all four design components positively, suggesting the design of the intervention may have supported their ability to transfer the knowledge and skills gained during the training to their work environment. Taken together, the study's findings demonstrate the promise of online transfer interventions to support the transfer of workplace training. In addition, the study offers potential design suggestions for transfer interventions that may, in turn, help trainees make sense of their learning and find ways to apply it to their on-the-job responsibilities. The study ends by demonstrating how data collected from an online transfer intervention might be analyzed to provide organizations with an overview of training quality and how training transfer might be supported at scale. Future research is needed to better understand the impact of online transfer interventions and how they might be designed to maximize transfer opportunities across topics and settings.

Abstract: This dissertation investigates the problem of how variations in the intensity of three selected constructs--multimedia signaling, speed and pacing, and cognitive engagement prompts--affect attention and learning outcomes in online learning environments. The study explores the intersecting cognitive theories of cognitive load, higher order thinking skills, and Mayer's principles of multimedia learning, with specific focus on his signaling principle. Through the use of eye-tracking technology, the study measures focal attention, while immediate and delayed knowledge retention tests assess learning outcomes. Employing a robust experimental design, the research utilizes eye-tracking technology to directly measure focal attention, alongside both immediate and delayed knowledge retention tests to evaluate learning outcomes. The methodological framework modulates the intensity of selected constructs across low, optimal, and high conditions, enabling a comprehensive assessment of their impacts. The findings reveal statistically significant effects for multimedia richness and speed, indicating optimal levels that enhance learner engagement. This research concludes that carefully calibrated multimedia signals can substantially benefit online learning environments, offering educators and content creators actionable insights for designing more effective and engaging educational experiences.

Abstract: It is of great significance to study the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between the new and the veteran employees within enterprises for promoting sustainable innovation from the perspective of innovation quality management. However, few studies have examined the impact of innovation quality on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between the new and veteran employees. In addition, knowledge of how reward and punishment incentives affect the effectiveness of knowledge transfer in innovation quality management remains insufficient. Since the amount of knowledge transfer is an important aspect of the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, this paper constructs a Stackelberg game model with an innovation-quality-oriented threshold of the knowledge transfer amount and investigates the amount of knowledge transfer between new and veteran employees in the collaborative innovation of research and development (R&D) projects within enterprises. A case study was used to reveal that the innovation-quality-oriented threshold for the knowledge transfer amount can effectively promote the amount of knowledge transfer between the new and the veteran employees in collaborative innovation. Moreover, reward is more effective than punishment in promoting the amount of knowledge transfer to exceed the innovation-quality-oriented threshold. This study enriches the theories of knowledge transfer games under quality management. By virtue of end-to-end project management strategies, modern multimedia technologies, and reward incentives this study can be used to conduct quality control during project execution, to promote knowledge retention in R&D projects, the innovation quality of projects, and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The research methodology employed in this paper was limited to a case study, and the data utilized are not empirical data.

Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to assess lifeguards’ knowledge retention of airway management, oxygen administration, and ventilation interventions following certification and employer-provided training. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey administered between February and May 2024. A total of 1322 responses from Canadian lifeguards certified in airway management and oxygen administration were deemed eligible for analysis. The survey included 15 knowledge assessment questions, with data analyzed based on lifeguard experience and the date of last certification or in-service training. Results: The mean knowledge assessment score was 10.4 ± 2.2 (69.3 ± 14.6%), with the highest scores in the airway management category and the lowest in the oxygen administration category. Lifeguard experience significantly increased knowledge retention, whereas recertification showed no significant impact, and employer-provided training significantly decreased knowledge retention. Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of lifeguarding experience in knowledge retention among lifeguards. Optional airway management and oxygen administration recertification, coupled with inconsistent in-service training, have created significant gaps in lifeguard education. This study identifies the need for regular, competency-based training delivered by qualified facilitators. Addressing these gaps is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of lifeguards in emergency response and ensuring high-quality care for drowning victims.

Abstract: Medical educators strive to improve their curricula to enhance the student learning experience. The use of high-fidelity simulation within basic and clinical medical science subjects has been one of these initiatives. However, there is paucity of evidence on using simulation for teaching pharmacology, especially in the Middle East and North Africa region, and the effectiveness of this teaching modality, relative to more traditional ones, have not been sufficiently investigated. Accordingly, this study compares the effects of high-fidelity simulation, which is designed in alignment with adult and experiential learning theories, and traditional case-based tutorial sessions on the performance and perception of undergraduate Year 2 medical students in pharmacology in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Accordingly, this study compares the effects of high-fidelity simulation, which is designed in alignment with adult and experiential learning theories, and traditional case-based tutorial sessions on the performance and perception of undergraduate Year 2 medical students in pharmacology in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.This study employed a convergent mixed methods approach. Forty-nine medical students were randomly assigned to one of two groups during the 16-week pharmacology course. Each group underwent one session delivered via high-fidelity simulation and another via a case-based tutorial. A short multiple-choice question quiz was administered twice (immediately upon completion of the respective sessions and 5 weeks afterwards) to assess knowledge retention. Furthermore, to explore the students' perceptions regarding the two modes of learning delivery (independently and in relation to each other), an evaluation survey was administered following the delivery of each session. Thereafter, the iterative joint display analysis was used to develop a holistic understanding of the effect of high-fidelity simulation in comparison to traditional case-based tutorial sessions on pharmacology learning in the context of the study.

Yet, students expressed a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation, describing the corresponding sessions as more varied, better at reinforcing learning, and closer to reality. As such, the meta-inferences led to expansion of the overall understanding around students' satisfaction, to both confirmation and expansion of the systemic viewpoint around students' preferences, and lastly to refinement in relation to the perspective around retained knowledge.

Nonetheless, students demonstrated a greater preference for high-fidelity simulation. The study advocates caution in adapting high-fidelity simulation, where careful appraisal can lend itself to identifying contexts where it is most effective.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/classroom-forest-analysis-outdoor-learning/docview/3093350211/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: This dissertation examines the impact of outdoor learning, including constructivist theories on student development in natural resource curricula. It highlights the importance of experiential, hands-on learning that connects students with nature. This approach challenges traditional methods by exploring active participation and sensory-rich experiences to enhance comprehension, critical thinking, and knowledge retention capabilities. The research explores the practical benefits of integrating nature-centric pedagogical approaches into a natural resource-based curriculum. Empirical evidence shows that outdoor environments, like forests, can alleviate stress, boost creativity, and foster a deeper connection with nature. These settings enhance student motivation, engagement, and material retention while aiding personal development in decision-making, teamwork, and leadership. This study focuses on the Idaho Natural Resources Camp (NRC), an immersive program educating youth about natural resource management through hands-on experiences. Using pre- and post-assessments over seven years, the study evaluates the camp's effectiveness in enhancing participants' knowledge and retention. The findings show significant improvements in understanding and skills, indicating that extended, immersive outdoor programs positively impact environmental knowledge and behavior. Early exposure to nature is crucial in shaping environmental perspectives and behaviors. Nature-based outdoor education programs are vital for nurturing environmentally literate individuals. This research highlights outdoor education's transformative potential to foster holistic development and environmental appreciation. Extended experiential programs like the NRC are essential for cultivating environmentally conscious citizens and future leaders in natural resource management.

Abstract: Despite growing efforts to increase diversity in recruitment and to teach principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), representation of individuals underrepresented in medicine continues to fall short. This demonstrates a need for efforts that target the work environment and culture to increase retention alongside existing recruitment initiatives. We designed this interactive allyship workshop with a focus on building skills necessary for being an ally that has been missing in existing allyship curricula. Introduction Despite growing efforts to increase diversity in recruitment and to teach principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), representation of individuals underrepresented in medicine continues to fall short. This demonstrates a need for efforts that target the work environment and culture to increase retention alongside existing recruitment initiatives. We designed this interactive allyship workshop with a focus on building skills necessary for being an ally that has been missing in existing allyship curricula.This workshop was led by multidepartmental faculty with experience in DEI training. Participants engaged in a number of interactive activities to reflect on their own identities and privilege and practiced ways to engage in difficult conversations. Prior to the workshop, participants completed a survey that was repeated at the workshop's completion to evaluate their perspective change and understanding of allyship. We also collected responses to a self-reflective exercise during the workshop. Methods This workshop was led by multidepartmental faculty with experience in DEI training.

Examining the Efficacies of Instructor-Designed Instructional Videos in Flipped Classrooms on Student Engagement and Learning Outcomes: An Empirical Study

Author: Shen, Yan    

Publication info: Shen, Yan. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/examining-efficacies-instructor-designed/docview/3087566895/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: Instructional videos constitute a pivotal component in flipped learning. Despite their significance, there is a dearth of research specifically dedicated to instructional videos within the context of flipped classrooms. This paucity has led to an empirical void in verifying the efficacy of instructional videos in flipped learning environments. Objectives: The present study endeavours to contribute to the extant literature on flipped pedagogical practices by providing empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of instructional videos in flipped learning environments. Methods: This study employs a convergent mixed-methods design. Forty-five instructional videos in three subtypes were administered in two classes over a 15-week semester. Data, both quantitative (log data from the learning management system) and qualitative (from focus group discussions at two time points), were concurrently collected from a flipped class (n = 25) and a blended class (n = 28) with the aim of gauging student engagement and learning outcomes in the flipped class and understanding video-viewing features typical of the flipped class. Results: Both datasets corroborated that participants in the flipped class outperformed their counterparts in the blended class in terms of video-watching, peer interaction, knowledge retention, and transfer skills. Conclusions: The instructional videos within the flipped classroom setting serve to enhance student engagement in the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The efficacy of these instructional videos in flipped learning can be further augmented through strategic approaches in both their design and implementation.

Abstract: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of the flipped classroom pedagogical approach on computer-based technology education in higher education. Grounded in Bloom’s revised taxonomy, this quasi-experimental study aimed to enhance students’ engagement, knowledge retention, and overall learning outcomes. Over thirteen weeks, a tailored program utilized prerecorded lectures and collaborative in-class activities. Pretest and posttest scores from computer skills tests were analyzed for instructional videos, with only one group of students using SPSS and Jamovi software. The experimental group showed a statistically significant increase in average scores compared to the control group. The research indicates that training significantly enhances the effectiveness of integrating flipped learning in classrooms. Furthermore, students who receive instruction using these tools demonstrate a stronger understanding of scientific concepts. The flipped classroom approach therefore has a positive influence. This study recommends further research in diverse educational contexts to highlight the potential applicability of this approach in fostering effective and dynamic learning environments.

Abstract: [...]the purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between knowledge management practices, specifically knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, knowledge creation, knowledge codification and knowledge retention on academicians' well-being. Four Malaysian private universities have been listed in the QS World University Rankings of 2020 (QS Asia University Rankings, 2020). [...]the purpose of this study will be to investigate the relationship between knowledge management and employee well-being among academicians in Malaysia's private higher education sector. 2. Physical well-being, material well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, and development and activity are the five dimensions of well-being (Kefeli et al., 2017). Since this study focuses on employee well-being, it is perceived as workplace well-being or quality of working life (Chan and Wyatt, 2007).

Abstract: Continual Federated Learning (CFL) is a distributed machine learning technique that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their data, while also adapting to new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Currently, there are limited evaluation models and metrics for measuring fairness in CFL, and ensuring fairness over time can be challenging as the system evolves. To address this, our study explores temporal fairness in CFL, examining how the fairness of the model can be influenced by the selection and participation of clients over time. We introduce novel fairness metrics—Delta Accuracy Fairness (DAF) and Delta Forgetting Fairness (DFF)—specifically designed to ensure temporal fairness in a CFL context. Additionally, we propose a set of client selection strategies that enhance the temporal fairness of the CFL model by addressing disparities in knowledge retention. Through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that while no single strategy guarantees perfect temporal fairness, the Low Participation and Low Average strategies consistently outperform others in terms of stability and equity. Furthermore, our findings underscore the adaptability of the Dynamic strategy, which shows significant promise in certain tasks. These insights pave the way for refining client selection strategies, enhancing CFL’s fairness, and fostering more equitable learning environments.

Na Wai Ke Ola: Examination of Freshwater Resources as They (In)Form Kanaka Maoli Identity and Governance

Abstract: This research centers on freshwater and its impacts on identity and governance in Hawaiʻi. Specifically, it explores how changes in water management and usage have impacted, and continue to impact, Kanaka Maoli identity and governance in pre- and post-contact Hawaiʻi. To understand the relationships among freshwater, governance, and identity to Kānaka Maoli, this study employed an ethnographic approach following the actions of two Maui taro farmers, Steven Hookano and Kimo Day of Wailuanui. This ethnography utilizes a video filmed by Hookano and Day as they assert their water access rights. Using a theory and methodology of interpretation as a framework, this study interprets the comments of two cultural practitioners within the physical contexts of their lives as kalo growers. The main findings from this study are as follows: Streams are held in high esteem by the communities built around them. Additionally, these communities have had an unbroken relationship with these streams since time immemorial. When diverting a stream, the concern extends to the whole community in several ways. First and foremost is the loss of wetland taro farming, gathering practices, community space, and even the loss of a part of the community. Second, there is also a concern regarding the loss of knowledge and traditions and the loss of the intergenerational transfer of said knowledge and traditions. Finally, large profit-focused corporations, during this writing, work ceaselessly to prevent the return of water to the streams, with the tacit complicity of the State of Hawaiʻi. This is illustrative of the shift from traditional Kanaka Maoli governance towards a more western and capitalistic society that places more importance on the extrinsic value of the resource than its intrinsic value.

School-Based Suicide Prevention and Postvention: School Psychologists' Knowledge of Ethics, Laws, and Best Practices

Author: Milito, Veronica Lynn

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/school-based-suicide-prevention-postvention/docview/3077645033/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Suicide is preventable, however suicide rates among children and adolescents are continuing to rise (Curtin & Heron, 2019). As such it is imperative that school psychologists who have an opportunity to impact the incidence of suicidal behaviors amongst students are properly trained in suicide prevention, postvention, laws, and ethics (Miller, 2014). However, there is little known about the efficacy of certain training approaches in suicide for school psychologists that may overcome barriers to implementation such as cost and time consumption (Dunn et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2013). The present study sought to create a measure encompassing school psychologists’ objective knowledge of suicide prevention/postvention best practices, laws, and ethics and their accuracy in implementing best practices, and sought to utilize this measure to evaluate the efficacy of a one-session, virtual, expert-led workshop. The knowledge segment comprised true/false questions regarding suicide prevention, postvention, laws and ethics. The accuracy portion encompassed hypothetical prevention and postvention situations with relevant evidence-based or nonevidence-based practices that were rated by likelihood of implementation on a 5-point scale. Upon review from experts in child/adolescent suicide and piloting of this measure with school psychologists, 50 practicing school psychologists completed the knowledge measure and vignettes before, one week after, and four weeks after attending a workshop. Their ages ranged from 26-65 with majority of participants being White women who work primarily in a public school setting. Knowledge measure and vignette scores significantly increased from pre-test to post-test time point and were maintained from post-test to follow up. Overall, this study highlights the efficacy of one session, virtual, expert-led workshops in increasing knowledge and application of knowledge. Past knowledge was found to be predictive of knowledge retention upon attending the workshop. Taken together these findings suggest that this format of training can be utilized for school psychologists in the field to remain current on best practices and follow up on prior knowledge to facilitate knowledge retention. As this training was only one hour and delivered in a virtual format, training in suicide can be more approachable and accessible to school psychologists. Other implications for practice and future research are discussed.

Abstract: Blended education in English combines traditional face-to-face teaching methods with online learning components, offering students a dynamic and flexible educational experience. It integrates technology into classroom instruction, providing access to digital resources, interactive learning platforms, and multimedia content. This approach allows for personalized learning experiences tailored to individual student needs while promoting collaboration, critical thinking, and digital literacy skills. Blended education in English fosters a conducive learning environment that combines the benefits of both traditional and online learning, enhancing student engagement and outcomes in English language acquisition and comprehension. This paper explores the potential of Cooperative Optimized Blended Education (COBE) to enhance interdisciplinary knowledge integration within English-blended education settings. Drawing upon theoretical frameworks such as game theory and optimization strategies, alongside empirical analyses and simulation results, the study elucidates the effectiveness of COBE in fostering collaborative learning outcomes. Through the utilization of digital resources, personalized learning paths, collaborative projects, blended assessment methods, and teacher training programs, COBE offers a dynamic and engaging approach to pedagogical innovation. Empirical findings and student performance data underscore the significance of COBE in promoting student engagement, knowledge retention, and interdisciplinary understanding. Furthermore, the paper highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment to support student academic achievement within СОВЕ. OBE resulted in a mean increase of 10% in student engagement, a 15% improvement in knowledge retention, and a 20% enhancement in interdisciplinary understanding.

Abstract: Aim/Purpose: To conduct a needs assessment and subsequently create micro-storytelling media aimed at enhancing the Digital Intelligence Quotient (DQ) skills of young individuals. Background: In today's digital society, DQ has emerged as a vital skill that elevates individuals in all aspects of life, from daily living to education. To empower Thai youth, this study seeks to innovate DQ content by adapting it into a digital format known as micro-storytelling. This unique approach combines the art of storytelling with digital elements, creating engaging and effective micro-learning media. Methodology: The methodology comprises three phases: 1) assessing the need for digital micro-storytelling development; 2) developing digital micro-storytelling; and 3) evaluating the DQ skills among young individuals. The sample group consisted of 55 higher education learners for needs assessment and 30 learners in the experiment group. Data analysis involves PNI modified, mean, and standard deviation. Contribution: This research contributes by addressing the urgent need for DQ skills in the digital era and by providing a practical solution in the form of digital micro-storytelling, tailored to the preferences and needs of Thai youth. It serves as a valuable resource for educators and policymakers seeking to empower young learners with essential digital competencies. Findings: The findings demonstrate three significant outcomes: 1) The learners wanted to organize their own learning experience with self-paced learning in a digital landscape, and they preferred digital media in the form of video. They were most interested in developing DQ to enhance their understanding of digital safety, digital security, and digital literacy; 2) according to a consensus of experts, digital micro-storytelling has the greatest degree of quality in terms of its development, content, and utilization, with an overall average of 4.86; and 3) the overall findings of the assessment of DQ skills indicate a favorable level of proficiency. Recommendations for Practitioners: Align materials with micro-learning principles, keeping content concise for effective knowledge retention. Empower students to personalize their digital learning and promote self-paced exploration based on their interests. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers should continuously assess and update digital learning materials to align with the evolving digital landscape and the changing needs of students and investigate the long-term effects of DQ improvement, especially in terms of online safety and digital literacy in students' future lives and careers. Impact on Society: This study's impact on society is centered around fostering a DQ, promoting innovative educational approaches, and elevating Thai youth with essential digital skills. It contributes to a safer, more informed, and digitally literate generation prepared for the challenges of the digital era. Future Research: Undertake comparative studies to analyze the effectiveness of different digital learning formats and methodologies. Comparing micro-storytelling with other approaches can help identify the most efficient and engaging methods for enhancing DQ.

Abstract: Experiential learning is widely used at the post-secondary level, but it requires intentional curricular planning, and proper facilitation from the instructor. The effects of experiential learning in agricultural education settings at the higher education level have not been tested extensively. Therefore, additional examination is needed to inform the practice of college faculty, especially those who wish to implement effective experiential learning in their teaching. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of reflection mode (peer verbal or written journal reflection) and transfer level (same, near, or far transfer) on students' post-course knowledge retention in an undergraduate, animal science, laboratory course. In total, 114 students were divided among six treatment groups using a quasi-experimental, two-way, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) design. There was no statistically significant interaction effect between reflection mode and transfer level on students' post course retention, nor were there statistically significant differences for theses main effects. While no treatment group was statistically significant, this does not mean that the mode of reflection or level of transfer were not effective practices. Rather, no reflection mode, transfer level, or combination thereof was more effective than the others. Practitioners of experiential education should seek to implement holistic models of experiential learning, which includes the facilitation of learner reflection and application, in order to foster an educative experience.

Abstract: Physical experiments in classrooms have many benefits for student learning, including increased student interest, participation and knowledge retention. While experiments are common in engineering and physics classes, they are seldom used in first-year calculus, where the focus is on solving problems analytically and, occasionally, numerically. In this paper, we detail a three-pronged lesson introducing differential equations using analytical, numerical and experimental approaches in a large first-year differential calculus course. Presenting the three approaches in succession allows students to evaluate advantages and disadvantages. The lesson incorporates software and programming and provides opportunities for active, experiential, team-based learning.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of short virtual reality (VR) exercises on knowledge retention for adult learners at a contractor safety training organisation supporting the energy industry who took computer-based training (CBT) courses. The intent was to simulate a delay period similar to that experienced by contractors who support work in the energy industry to determine if traditional CBT can be made more effective for stimulating greater transfer of learning with the addition of VR exercises. The experimental group was exposed to CBTs augmented by VR exercises that reinforced the CBT course learning objectives. The control group for this research took the same CBT course without short VR exercises. A quantitative analysis was performed on data collected from a course exam provided immediately after the course delivery and from a separate follow-up quiz delivered 3 days after the course(s) completion. Data from these testing instruments were analysed to determine the participant's likelihood of remembering content from the CBT courses and if there was greater knowledge retention of the course learning objectives and procedures within the experimental group than within the control group. The results found a non-statistically significant relationship between the two groups; however, trends between the groups show that there are benefits for transfer of learning when using short VR exercises compared to those groups without short VR exercises.

Abstract: Upon examining the historical trajectory of literature, it becomes evident that literary works often incorporate terminology shaped by contemporary age and technological advancements. An essential consideration lies in understanding the influence of technology on language skill development, learner achievement, attitudes, and motivation in literature education, particularly regarding the introduction of new terms. This study investigates the impact of modern teaching technologies on the instruction of new terms in Kazakhstan literature, analyzing its effects on students' achievements, attitudes, and knowledge retention. Employing a quasi-experimental design with a control group pre-test post-test model, the study involved 63 students in a literature department at a Kazakh university. The experimental group was taught new terms through the MoodleCloud program, while the control group received traditional instruction. Experimental applications in the study lasted 6 weeks. The research findings underscore a significant enhancement in students' achievements, attitudes, and retention when utilizing modern teaching technologies for literature instruction.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to implement the Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) approach employing online games for English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teaching and learning. The participants were 53 EFL Ecuadorian university students, 17 males and 36 females, who were enrolled in an English Major and a TEFL Master program. Their proficiency level corresponded to B2 according to the Common European Framework of Reference. The study followed a mixed-method approach, which involved the administration of a diagnostic survey, an online perceptions questionnaire, an interview, and an observation checklist. Games designed in Quizizz, Kahoot, Genially, and Socrative were implemented for 8 weeks so that the participants could access them to practice the content of each lesson. The findings revealed that the CLIL approach through games improves language learning and communication.

Abstract: This study examined the impact of a pedagogy that is culturally influenced and laced with technological and contextual elements known as the culturo-techno-contextual approach (CTCA) on promoting knowledge retention of biology concepts. The research design was mixed methods, and the sample consisted of 88 senior secondary school II students selected from two Lagos State educational district V schools in Nigeria. Quantitative data was collected using the Variation and Evolution Achievement Test with a reliability value of 0.79, while qualitative data was collected using the Students' Perception of CTCA Interview Guide. All students in the two sample schools used for the experimental and control groups took a pretest before treatment, a posttest at the end of the treatment phase, and a retention test four weeks later. The ANCOVA output demonstrated a statistically significant difference in knowledge retention [F (1,85) = 134.50; p < 0.05]. This suggests that experimental students retained more.

Introductory Chemistry Student Success: Evaluating Peer-Led Team Learning and Understanding Sense of Belonging

Abstract: Identifying approaches that make science and engineering education broader and more inclusive is core to discipline based education research. Both fundamental and applied research are important in advancing a STEM education that retains the necessary scientists of the U.S.'s future. Thus, the major goal of this work was to evaluate and describe efforts that promote student success within introductory STEM courses. This began with applied research by utilizing quantitative analyses like case-matching, logistic regression, independent sample t-tests, and repeated measures while evaluating the efficacy of peer-led team learning (PLTL). Later, this work delves into qualitative approaches to answer fundamental research questions. Grounded theory is used to construct a chemistry-specific theory of students' sense of belonging. The research topics and research methodologies that encompass this work are broad. However, these topics and methodologies all contribute to the larger goal of creating both fundamental and applied research that contribute to a broader and more inclusive science and engineering education starting in our undergraduate chemistry courses. This work quantitatively advanced applied work that seeks to bring more scientists and engineers into society via active learning. The first quantitative study sought to evaluate PLTL's effect on students' performance and persistence. Exam scores and persistence data was collected from online General Chemistry II courses which were taught either using online-didactic pedagogy or online-PLTL pedagogy (Chapter III). Using case comparison, t-tests, and logistic regressions, the evaluation demonstrated that students engaging in online-PLTL performed notably better across exams than those engaging with the online-didactic approach. Additionally, those involved in online PLTL exhibited a higher probability of securing a passing grade, resulting in fewer instances of failure and course withdrawals. These outcomes strongly suggest that PLTL is an efficacious educational method in an online learning environment. Next, a different study sought to evaluate PLTL's effect on students' knowledge retention. Measuring student knowledge repeatedly for one year following enrollment in general chemistry and for a different cohort while they were enrolled in analytical chemistry (Chapter IV). In both studies, a repeated measures design was employed, revealing no discernible impact of teaching methods on the sustained retention of information. This discovery, coupled with insights from prior research, suggests that PLTL enhances student achievement and aids in retaining knowledge in a manner that is comparable to didactic pedagogy. Furthermore, this work created fundamental research through qualitative methodology. The first study used grounded theory to advance a chemistry-specific theory of sense of belonging (Chapter V). The study was important given there are many potential threats to belonging during the transition to college in introductory STEM courses. 19 postsecondary students from introductory chemistry were interviewed with a semi-structured approach. Grounded theory was used as a qualitative analysis to conceptualize sense of belonging. Belonging can be situational, dependent on the occurrences within the setting, or dispositional, representing long-standing tendencies. It is also acceptance-based, such as friendships and support, or value-based, where contributions are recognized or acted upon. These traits are combined into four dimensions: Situational Acceptance, Dispositional Acceptance, Situational Value, and Dispositional Value. This nuanced understanding can guide instructional and research efforts to improve students' sense of belonging.

Abstract: Introduction: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted virus affecting around 13 million people yearly in the United States. HPV is a causative factor for various types of cancers, including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. HPV vaccination prevents these related cancers by preventing the infections that cause them. The purpose of this study is to determine if increased knowledge about HPV impacts dental students’ willingness to discuss HPV and HPV vaccination with patients in the dental setting. Methods: This quasi-experimental study recruited participants from second year predoctoral dental students at Nova Southeastern University, College of Dental Medicine. Participants received a pre-intervention assessment of their knowledge and attitudes about HPV. The participants then received an educational intervention about HPV and HPV prevention, after which they completed a post-intervention assessment to examine changes in knowledge level and attitudes about HPV. Lastly, participants completed a one-month follow-up knowledge assessment to evaluate the level of knowledge retention. Descriptive statistics were calculated, t-tests were used to assess changes in knowledge level, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to assess changes in attitudes related to HPV. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between HPV knowledge and willingness of dental students to discuss HPV and HPV vaccination with patients in the dental setting. Results: Results indicate a significant, 11.4% increase in mean knowledge between pre-lecture (15.68, SD = 2.03) and post-lecture (17.47, SD = 2.51) scores; p < .001. Attitude items, “I am able to provide accurate and compelling information about HPV and the HPV vaccine to patients to aid in making the decision to vaccinate” and “I believe my patients will be comfortable discussing HPV and HPV vaccination with their dentist” showed a significant increase in levels of agreement; p < .001. The remaining items from the Attitude Assessment showed no significant changes in levels of agreement. Additionally, no significant association was found between knowledge level and scores for the four items related to willingness to discuss HPV and HPV vaccination, time spent discussing HPV, or referral of patients for vaccination before and after the intervention. There was no significant difference between the mean post-intervention knowledge score immediately following the intervention (18.17, SD = 2.94) and the mean knowledge score at 1-month follow-up (18.17, SD = 3.03); p = 1.00. Conclusions: This study highlights the successes and challenges in improving dental students' knowledge and attitudes regarding HPV and HPV vaccination. While the intervention increased knowledge and certain attitudes, willingness to discuss HPV or HPV vaccination with patients did not change significantly as a result of the intervention. As evidenced by the pre-lecture assessment, second-year students demonstrated a predisposition to discuss HPV with patients, likely attributed to their level of education and altruistic tendencies towards patient care. Gaps in HPV understanding persist, highlighting a need for targeted education. Addressing stigma and providing communication training can likely enhance discussions about HPV in dental settings, fostering better overall understanding.

An Experiential Account of Semantic Category Organization in the Brain

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/experiential-account-semantic-category/docview/3074668995/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: There have been extensive efforts to understand how concepts are represented in the brain. One phenomenon that has received much attention is the loss of knowledge seemingly restricted to a single category of items. This clinical observation, combined with many functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that find differential activation across the cortex depending on the category of the stimuli, has led to a general view of category related functional organization across the cortex. One class of models put forward to explain this phenomenon are experiential models of cognition. Experiential models, like the one examined in this dissertation, propose that, ultimately, all semantic knowledge is grounded in what is experienced. They posit that those regions of the cortex involved in experiencing an object (e.g., perceiving an object) are also involved in representing semantic knowledge about the object. Thus, the idea that different kinds of experiential information (e.g., color, sound, shape, touch, etc.) are differentially important across categories of concepts, combined with the fact that some regions of the brain preferentially process a particular type of experiential information, is hypothesized as a potential explanation for observed category organization. However, the ability of experiential models to explain category organization has hitherto not been empirically examined. This dissertation tests for a shared representational basis, consisting of experiential features, across all semantic categories, as implied by experiential models of semantics. Throughout this dissertation, experiential information is operationalized as human ratings for concepts along different features. FMRI is used to derive neural representations of concepts from participants as they read words and perform a semantic decision task. Using these data, this dissertation also tests the hypotheses that semantic features are hierarchically organized, and that accessing semantic information involves activation of relevant perceptual regions of cortex. This dissertation first describes and validates an fMRI dataset that is well suited for addressing the mentioned predictions of experiential models of semantic cognition. Following data validation, evidence for the categorical organization of the semantic system was found via both mass univariate and multivoxel pattern analyses. Then, encoding models constructed for each point on the cortical surface demonstrated that experiential features could predict activation category contrasts as well as activation patterns for individual stimuli across categorical boundaries. The subsequent chapter examines a relatively understudied yet distinctly represented category of concepts: body parts. We found that a robust network of regions was significantly more involved in the representation of body part concepts compared to concepts from other concrete noun categories. The implicated set of areas was shown to be predicted by experiential features using several analysis techniques. Lastly, using the neural activity patterns induced from participants reading words, feature sensitivity maps across the cortex were generated for a set of 14 experiential features. These maps were observed to hierarchically converge as the distance from canonical primary sensory cortices increased. The maps are also individually discussed with reference to prior literature. Results were mixed with regard to how well individual feature maps matched expectations derived from prior literature, and possible reasons for this are discussed. Taken together, the results of this dissertation offer strong support for the proposed explanation of category-related organization posited by an experiential model of concept representation.

Abstract: - Virtual simulation technology, a cornerstone of modern innovation, revolutionizes the way we interact with virtual environments, offering immersive experiences across various fields. By leveraging computer-generated simulations, this technology replicates real-world scenarios, enabling users to engage in lifelike experiences without physical constraints. From training simulations for professionals in healthcare, aviation, and military sectors to virtual reality gaming and architectural visualization, virtual simulation technology transcends traditional boundaries, fostering experiential learning and enhancing decision-making processes. Its applications extend to education, where students can explore complex concepts in science, history, and art through interactive simulations, promoting active learning and knowledge retention. As technology continues to evolve, virtual simulation remains at the forefront, continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in immersive experiences. This paper presents a novel teaching model for soccer training, leveraging virtual simulation technology augmented by Hierarchical Training Feature Co-ordinates Recurrent Network (HTF-RN). The proposed model aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of soccer training programs by providing immersive and interactive experiences in virtual environments. Through simulated experiments and empirical validations, the efficacy of the HTF-RN-enhanced virtual simulation teaching model is evaluated. Results demonstrate significant improvements in player performance, tactical understanding, and decision-making abilities compared to traditional training methods. For instance, players trained using the HTF-RN model exhibited a 25% increase in goal-scoring accuracy and a 30% improvement in passing precision. Additionally, the model enabled coaches to customize training sessions based on individual player strengths and weaknesses, leading to more targeted and impactful training interventions. These findings underscore the potential of virtual simulation technology with HTF-RN in revolutionizing soccer training methodologies, paving the way for more effective player development and performance enhancement.

Abstract: The transfer of training from learning environments to workplace environments has been a major concern for training professionals and researchers for decades. How should organizations evaluate the effectiveness of their training programs and what impacts are those programs having on their employees’ on-the-job performance? These questions are particularly relevant in an age of e-learning courses because many organizations are looking for practical ways to support the transfer of the knowledge and skills employees learn during training to real-world contexts. To address this issue, an experimental study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of an online transfer intervention (Transfer e-Booster) designed to measure and promote training transfer. A total of 53 volunteers (control n = 25, experimental n = 28) at a non-profit organization participated in the study by completing an e-learning course about emergency preparedness. Following the e-learning course, participants in the experimental group interacted with an online transfer intervention and completed an experience survey. The study measured two aspects of training transfer: knowledge retention and behavioral application. In addition, participants in the experimental group rated their perceptions of the intervention’s main design components: key identified behaviors, knowledge retention questions, behavioral application self-assessment, and peer sharing. Four weeks after the e-learning course, all participants completed a post-test. The results of the experiment yielded mixed results. Participants in the experimental group earned significantly higher knowledge retention scores. They also earned higher behavioral application scores, but the difference was not significant. In terms of their perceptions of the online transfer intervention, participants rated all four design components positively, suggesting the design of the intervention may have supported their ability to transfer the knowledge and skills gained during the training to their work environment. Taken together, the study’s findings demonstrate the promise of online transfer interventions to support the transfer of workplace training. In addition, the study offers potential design suggestions for transfer interventions that may, in turn, help trainees make sense of their learning and find ways to apply it to their on-the-job responsibilities. The study ends by demonstrating how data collected from an online transfer intervention might be analyzed to provide organizations with an overview of training quality and how training transfer might be supported at scale. Future research is needed to better understand the impact of online transfer interventions and how they might be designed to maximize transfer opportunities across topics and settings.

Na Wai Ke Ola: Examination of Freshwater Resources as They (In)form Kanaka Maoli Identity and Governance

Abstract: This research centers on freshwater and its impacts on identity and governance in Hawaiʻi. Specifically, it explores how changes in water management and usage have impacted, and continue to impact, Kanaka Maoli identity and governance in pre- and post-contact Hawaiʻi. To understand the relationships among freshwater, governance, and identity to Kānaka Maoli, this study employed an ethnographic approach following the actions of two Maui taro farmers, Steven Hookano and Kimo Day of Wailuanui. This ethnography utilizes a video filmed by Hookano and Day as they assert their water access rights. Using a theory and methodology of interpretation as a framework, this study interprets the comments of two cultural practitioners within the physical contexts of their lives as kalo growers. The main findings from this study are as follows: Streams are held in high esteem by the communities built around them. Additionally, these communities have had an unbroken relationship with these streams since time immemorial. When diverting a stream, the concern extends to the whole community in several ways. First and foremost is the loss of wetland taro farming, gathering practices, community space, and even the loss of a part of the community. Second, there is also a concern regarding the loss of knowledge and traditions and the loss of the intergenerational transfer of said knowledge and traditions. Finally, large profit-focused corporations, during this writing, work ceaselessly to prevent the return of water to the streams, with the tacit complicity of the State of Hawaiʻi. This is illustrative of the shift from traditional Kanaka Maoli governance towards a more western and capitalistic society that places more importance on the extrinsic value of the resource than its intrinsic value.

Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this paper is to explore how the involvement of workplace teams in experimenting with changes in their work practices through short, time-boxed, experiments (STBEs) can support organizational learning. It is explored how staffs’ experiences with experimental practices give rise to shared knowledge and how this is supported by the design of the STBE-procedure. Also explored is how the STBEs support knowledge retainment. Design/methodology/approach: The study builds on the authors’ participation in a research and development project across seven financial enterprises in Denmark. Qualitative material was developed as part of the experiments. Theoretically emphasizing experience, knowledge creation through dialogue and knowledge retention, the material was analyzed, focusing on participants’ experiences and interactions, as well as on procedures. Findings: The STBEs occasioned direct experience with new work practices for managers and employees. Supported by the STBE-procedure, these experiences generated new knowledge individually, collectively and on an organizational level. The procedure also created routines that can underpin the retainment of the new practices and knowledge related to incorporating it in the organization. Research limitations/implications: The study implicates experience with changes in work practices to be understood as predominantly mindful in opposition to simple, even when the changes appear to be simple. Practical implications: The STBEs are applicable when working with organizational learning related to new work practices. Procedures supporting dialogue and mindful processes appear to be advantageous in relation to learning from experiments. Originality/value: Based on an original research and development project and unique qualitative material, the study adds to discussions on how to best conduct and learn from experiments in organizations.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) and emotionally resonant videos on knowledge retention for adult learners at a contractor safety training organization supporting the energy industry. The intent of this research was to determine if traditional computer-based training (CBT) can be made more effective with the addition of VR exercises with emotionally resonant videos. The two experimental groups were exposed to either CBTs augmented by VR exercises that reinforced the CBT course learning objectives and included work-relevant videos designed to arouse an emotional response or CBTs with VR exercises without videos. The control group for this research took the same CBT course without VR exercises and without videos. A quantitative analysis was performed on data collected from a follow-up quiz delivered three days after the completion of the course(s). Data from this follow-up quiz was analyzed to determine if there was greater knowledge retention of the course learning objectives and procedures among the experimental groups than among the control group. The results found a non-statistically significant relationship between the groups, however, trends between the groups show that there are benefits for transfer of learning when using VR and VR with emotionally resonant videos compared to those groups without these tools. Additionally, a deeper analysis of the results, when considering aspects of the participants' demographic and experience variables, suggests that the recall quiz results may have been affected by an increased cognitive load on younger and inexperienced participants.

Reconceptualizing Civic Education: Local Knowledge for Civic Competence

Abstract: Scholars and educators tout the benefits of civic education for civic competence, the ability to act on and complete meaningful political tasks. However, researchers debate which educative approaches make competent and engaged citizens. In this dissertation, I use multiple methods to examine how curriculum and pedagogy shape political knowledge, self-efficacy, and trust, all crucial ingredients for civic competence. I argue we need to reconceptualize civic education by incorporating local knowledge about diverse lived political experiences into curricula. In the first of three papers, I analyze data from focus groups with 162 students and show that young people from ideologically, racially, and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds all want to learn more local and relevant political content. They believe this would increase their ability and desire to be politically engaged. Does learning local political content really improve political outcomes associated with civic competence? I examine this question in two additional papers. In paper 2, I test the relationship between local content and political outcomes by teaching a minicourse using engaged pedagogy to 23 youth randomized into two learning cohorts. Treatment group students ( n =12) received content about local civic education, while control group students ( n =11) learned about national civics. Using pre- and post-surveys, observations, and an exit focus group, I find all students increased their political knowledge and self-efficacy through enrollment in the engaged pedagogy experience, and students in the local curriculum classroom had higher levels of knowledge retention alongside greater increases in knowledge and self-efficacy. In paper 3, I analyze a novel survey that again tests the impact of local curricular content on student civic outcomes. Students ( n =586) randomly received one of four newspaper articles about local political and/or policy relevant content. I find small curricular changes that include local and relevant information improve youth civic outcomes that are associated with participatory political behavior, a primary goal of civics education. I contribute to the future of civic education research by leveraging rigorous mixed methods and community-engaged scholarship to reconceptualize how we define and measure civic competence in a pluralist United States. These findings are valuable for interdisciplinary civic education scholarship, policymakers, and educators.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel transfer learning regularization method based on knowledge distillation. Recently, transfer learning methods have been used in various fields. However, problems such as knowledge loss still occur during the process of transfer learning to a new target dataset. To solve these problems, there are various regularization methods based on knowledge distillation techniques. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning regularization method based on feature map alignment used in the field of knowledge distillation. The proposed method is composed of two attention-based submodules: self-pixel attention (SPA) and global channel attention (GCA). The self-pixel attention submodule utilizes both the feature maps of the source and target models, so that it provides an opportunity to jointly consider the features of the target and the knowledge of the source. The global channel attention submodule determines the importance of channels through all layers, unlike the existing methods that calculate these only within a single layer. Accordingly, transfer learning regularization is performed by considering both the interior of each single layer and the depth of the entire layer. Consequently, the proposed method using both of these submodules showed overall improved classification accuracy than the existing methods in classification experiments on commonly used datasets.

Abstract: Firearm injuries are the leading cause of death in the United States for children aged 1-19. Shootings at schools have increased in incidence and have resulted in many children dying. The purpose of this project is to implement “Stop the Bleed” (STB) training for school nurses in an urban midwestern school district. STB education was provided to 22 registered school nurses in an on-site training session with a pre-and post-test. A five-month follow-up to evaluate knowledge retention was completed in January 2024. A statistically significant increase in participant knowledge occurred between pre- and post-training tests, and knowledge was retained at five months. This paper adds to the literature by demonstrating that implementing STB increases school nurse preparedness. Further, the author suggests ways to expand the training program beyond school nurses.

Abstract: This dissertation investigates the problem of how variations in the intensity of three selected constructs—multimedia signaling, speed and pacing, and cognitive engagement prompts—affect attention and learning outcomes in online learning environments. The study explores the intersecting cognitive theories of cognitive load, higher order thinking skills, and Mayer’s principles of multimedia learning, with specific focus on his signaling principle. Through the use of eye-tracking technology, the study measures focal attention, while immediate and delayed knowledge retention tests assess learning outcomes. Employing a robust experimental design, the research utilizes eye-tracking technology to directly measure focal attention, alongside both immediate and delayed knowledge retention tests to evaluate learning outcomes. The methodological framework modulates the intensity of selected constructs across low, optimal, and high conditions, enabling a comprehensive assessment of their impacts. The findings reveal statistically significant effects for multimedia richness and speed, indicating optimal levels that enhance learner engagement. This research concludes that carefully calibrated multimedia signals can substantially benefit online learning environments, offering educators and content creators actionable insights for designing more effective and engaging educational experiences.

Abstract: Poor dietary habits are a leading contributor to premature mortality and increased risk of chronic disease. Due to the deleterious effects of chronic disease on longevity and quality of life, it is a key public health goal to improve the population’s diet. Nutrition education is key to improving the population’s diet. However, the success of this approach has been modest and new methods for understanding how people make food choices are needed to promote better dietary habits. Virtual reality (VR) uses computer-generated scenes to simulate real world environments. There is evidence showing virtual behavior largely corresponds with actual behavior in personal computer (PC) application studies. Participant engagement with the virtual immersive environment allows the opportunity to present realistic life situations that can be manipulated to reflect the natural setting. At present, it has not been determined if an immersive virtual reality (IVR) application is more effective than conventional study methods.  A key aspect of IVR is its ability to create a sense of presence. Presence causes the user to suspend disbelief and believe they are present in the IVR environment and respond to stimuli as they would in the real world. Crucially, the sense of presence is correlated with the effectiveness of IVR to engage learning, establish new behaviors, and promote long-term knowledge retention. The goal of this exploratory study was to determine (1) the sense of presence experienced in two food related IVR scenes and (2) if the applications are viable to utilize as tools for understanding behavior in relationship to food decisions. Two three-dimensional (3D), computer generated environments (a supermarket and restaurant) were created for this study. The scenes were displayed using a head mounted display or standard PC monitor. Participants were allowed to move around each scene to interact with various elements and obtain nutrition information about selected foods. Thirty-one adults were recruited and randomized to complete the study with four separate visits. Methods to evaluate the sense of presence included physiological measures of heart rate variability and skin conductance changes, as well as subjective measures obtained through questionnaires regarding their experiences within each scene. Participants reported a higher sense of presence in the IVR scenes as compared to the PC monitor (p<0.0001). The IVR scenes also created a greater sense that the participant was actually in the scene (p<0.0001). There was no difference in the participant’s ability to complete tasks or feelings of nausea in the different scenes. The participant’s heart rate was significantly higher in the IVR treatment (p<0.0001). This study provides data to support the feasibility of developing IVR in a food-related setting to evaluate how food decisions are made. Further research is required to develop IVR as a tool to better understand nutrition education interventions.

Abstract: Organizational processes have been recognized as valuable knowledge assets. Situational Method Engineering (SME) processes are particularly valuable as they are used for engineering other processes: SME processes help construct bespoke Software Development Methodologies (SDMs) for specific software-engineering project situations. Every SDM has a Software Development Process (SDP) at its heart, which specifies the activities that should be performed throughout the project, the products that should be produced, and the people that should be involved. Existing SME methods suffer from certain weaknesses that are rooted in loss of knowledge within their processes; for instance, the method engineers' experience, which is a kind of tacit knowledge, is not properly captured and utilized in these processes. Managing SME process knowledge helps alleviate these weaknesses through reusing the software developers' experience and maintaining the method engineers' knowledge. We propose an evaluation framework that can be used for assessing an SME method's ability to manage process knowledge. We also provide a model that guides the improvement of existing SME methods in their support for Knowledge Management (KM), and also helps engineer new SME methods that provide adequate KM support. We have assessed the applicability of the proposed evaluation framework and improvement model by using them to enhance eight prominent SME methods, and also by applying them to four industrial case studies.

Abstract: The capitalisation on and transfer of technological, engineering and scientific knowledge associated with empirical know-how is an important issue for the sustainability and development of manufacturing. Indeed, certain sectors of industry are facing the increasing ageing of the labour force, recruitment difficulties and high staff turnover, leading to a loss of knowledge and know-how. In a context of numerical and digital transition and the migration of processes to industry 4.0, one of major challenges manufacturers face today is their capacity to build intelligent platforms for acquiring, storing and transferring their know-how and knowledge. It is crucial to create new media and tools for staff training and development capable of capturing knowledge and reusing it to create a project history through expertise and data collection. This paper presents the methodology and guidelines for implementing electronic knowledge books (eK-Books), along with their uses. The eK-Book is a semantic web-based hypertext medium (channel) allowing stakeholders to capitalise on, structure and transfer knowledge by using concept maps, process maps, influence graphs, downloadable documents, web pages and hypermedia knowledge sheets. They are intended for engineers, expert or novice technicians, manufacturers, sector coordinators and plant managers, as well as trainers and learners. They are usable and manageable in all types of environments and with different levels of accessibility. This paper highlights (1) the transfer knowledge capacity of eK-Books and (2) their usability in two agri-food sectors namely (1) the cheese sector with protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI), and (2) the butchery and cold meat sectors.The capitalisation on and transfer of technological, engineering and scientific knowledge associated with empirical know-how is an important issue for the sustainability and development of manufacturing. Indeed, certain sectors of industry are facing the increasing ageing of the labour force, recruitment difficulties and high staff turnover, leading to a loss of knowledge and know-how. In a context of numerical and digital transition and the migration of processes to industry 4.0, one of major challenges manufacturers face today is their capacity to build intelligent platforms for acquiring, storing and transferring their know-how and knowledge. It is crucial to create new media and tools for staff training and development capable of capturing knowledge and reusing it to create a project history through expertise and data collection. This paper presents the methodology and guidelines for implementing electronic knowledge books (eK-Books), along with their uses. The eK-Book is a semantic web-based hypertext medium (channel) allowing stakeholders to capitalise on, structure and transfer knowledge by using concept maps, process maps, influence graphs, downloadable documents, web pages and hypermedia knowledge sheets. They are intended for engineers, expert or novice technicians, manufacturers, sector coordinators and plant managers, as well as trainers and learners. They are usable and manageable in all types of environments and with different levels of accessibility. This paper highlights (1) the transfer knowledge capacity of eK-Books and (2) their usability in two agri-food sectors namely (1) the cheese sector with protected designation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI), and (2) the butchery and cold meat sectors.

Abstract: Identifying approaches that make science and engineering education broader and more inclusive is core to discipline based education research. Both fundamental and applied research are important in advancing a STEM education that retains the necessary scientists of the U.S.’s future. Thus, the major goal of this work was to evaluate and describe efforts that promote student success within introductory STEM courses. This began with applied research by utilizing quantitative analyses like case-matching, logistic regression, independent sample t-tests, and repeated measures while evaluating the efficacy of peer-led team learning (PLTL). Later, this work delves into qualitative approaches to answer fundamental research questions. Grounded theory is used to construct a chemistry-specific theory of students’ sense of belonging. The research topics and research methodologies that encompass this work are broad. However, these topics and methodologies all contribute to the larger goal of creating both fundamental and applied research that contribute to a broader and more inclusive science and engineering education starting in our undergraduate chemistry courses. This work quantitatively advanced applied work that seeks to bring more scientists and engineers into society via active learning. The first quantitative study sought to evaluate PLTL’s effect on students’ performance and persistence. Exam scores and persistence data was collected from online General Chemistry II courses which were taught either using online-didactic pedagogy or online-PLTL pedagogy (Chapter III). Using case comparison, t-tests, and logistic regressions, the evaluation demonstrated that students engaging in online-PLTL performed notably better across exams than those engaging with the online-didactic approach. Additionally, those involved in online PLTL exhibited a higher probability of securing a passing grade, resulting in fewer instances of failure and course withdrawals. These outcomes strongly suggest that PLTL is an efficacious educational method in an online learning environment. Next, a different study sought to evaluate PLTL’s effect on students’ knowledge retention. Measuring student knowledge repeatedly for one year following enrollment in general chemistry and for a different cohort while they were enrolled in analytical chemistry (Chapter IV). In both studies, a repeated measures design was employed, revealing no discernible impact of teaching methods on the sustained retention of information. This discovery, coupled with insights from prior research, suggests that PLTL enhances student achievement and aids in retaining knowledge in a manner that is comparable to didactic pedagogy. Furthermore, this work created fundamental research through qualitative methodology. The first study used grounded theory to advance a chemistry-specific theory of sense of belonging (Chapter V). The study was important given there are many potential threats to belonging during the transition to college in introductory STEM courses. 19 postsecondary students from introductory chemistry were interviewed with a semi-structured approach. Grounded theory was used as a qualitative analysis to conceptualize sense of belonging. Belonging can be situational, dependent on the occurrences within the setting, or dispositional, representing long-standing tendencies. It is also acceptance-based, such as friendships and support, or value-based, where contributions are recognized or acted upon. These traits are combined into four dimensions: Situational Acceptance, Dispositional Acceptance, Situational Value, and Dispositional Value. This nuanced understanding can guide instructional and research efforts to improve students’ sense of belonging.

Abstract: Clinical reasoning is the core of healthcare professionals' clinical practice and allows practitioners to make responsible and informed clinical decisions for patients. Physical therapists require higher-order thinking, adaptability, and clinical reasoning skills to provide quality care to patients with increasing complexity in the evolving and dynamic healthcare system. The Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education and the American Physical Therapy Association have standards and guiding documents identifying developing and assessing clinical reasoning as essential components of physical therapy education. Lastly, the guide to physical therapy practice provides descriptions and projections of clinical reasoning related to diagnosis, prognosis, development, and management of the care plan. There is a lack of research that supports and validates clinical reasoning instruction in doctor of physical therapy (DPT) programs. An investigation was warranted to discern the most effective teaching strategies in DPT education programs to improve the clinical reasoning skills of DPT students across the continuum of physical therapy education. Despite finding clinical teaching strategies that are beneficial to the development of clinical reasoning skills, the findings of this literature expose that clinical studies identifying the best clinical teaching strategies to develop clinical reasoning skills are in their infancy yet provide a framework for selecting and implementing a DPT educational program. Higher doses of experiential learning are associated with increased selfperceived clinical reasoning and self-efficacy among healthcare students. Although students may prefer different types of simulation experiences, they positively impact cognitive processes, patient care performance, and clinical decision-making skills. Cased-based learning may not outperform other clinical teaching strategies. However, it is a valuable tool to improve healthcare students' critical thinking, clinical reasoning, and knowledge retention. Lastly, the combination of early exposure to clinical reasoning concepts, integration of technology-enhanced learning tools, and implementation of active learning processes, such as problem-based learning, are effective in enhancing students’ clinical reasoning skills and self-efficacy.

Abstract: In rural western Kenya, community health promoters (CHPs) serve to address access to health care for women and infants in their local communities. They do this by conducting home visits to offer health education, assistance, and referrals during the postpartum and neonatal period. Despite this and other health care initiatives, maternal and infant morbidity and mortality rates were increasing in this area. A quality improvement project was established to address the CHPs’ knowledge that supports their care. The objectives of this quality improvement project were to establish CHPs’ baseline understanding regarding the signs and symptoms of deteriorating maternal and newborn health during the postpartum period and to improve CHP knowledge regarding the criteria for referring cases to health clinics or hospitals. A culturally sensitive one-day educational workshop was designed for CHPs, incorporating key content identified by county health officials and consistent with health care standards. This content focused on enabling CHPs to recognize when a postpartum woman or neonate requires transfer to a hospital. The workshop utilized interactive discussions, case scenarios, and small group activities, supported by evidence from the literature. Pre-test and post-test assessments were conducted to gauge baseline knowledge and knowledge acquisition. Two workshops were held in different regions, with a total of 43 CHPs in attendance. To assess knowledge retention, a 1-month post-test was administered to participants. Repeated measure ANOVA demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge from pre-test to post-test. Paired t test demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge from pre-test to 1-month post-test. Interactive education methodologies increased CHP knowledge during a one-day workshop. The knowledge change was sustained from post-education intervention to 1 month post, and scores were significant from pre-test scores. Workshops for CHPs to build and sustain knowledge are essential to address maternal and newborn health. The outcome of this pilot project will be used to revise the workshop content and tests for future workshops.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of short virtual reality (VR) exercises on knowledge retention for adult learners at a contractor safety training organisation supporting the energy industry who took computer-based training (CBT) courses. The intent was to simulate a delay period similar to that experienced by contractors who support work in the energy industry to determine if traditional CBT can be made more effective for stimulating greater transfer of learning with the addition of VR exercises. The experimental group was exposed to CBTs augmented by VR exercises that reinforced the CBT course learning objectives. The control group for this research took the same CBT course without short VR exercises. A quantitative analysis was performed on data collected from a course exam provided immediately after the course delivery and from a separate follow-up quiz delivered 3 days after the course(s) completion. Data from these testing instruments were analysed to determine the participants likelihood of remembering content from the CBT courses and if there was greater knowledge retention of the course learning objectives and procedures within the experimental group than within the control group. The results found a non-statistically significant relationship between the two groups; however, trends between the groups show that there are benefits for transfer of learning when using short VR exercises compared to those groups without short VR exercises.

Abstract: Background: Dalmatian Zagora has experienced significant depopulation trends over recent decades. The area is very interesting because of its rich biodiversity of species as well as its history of the use of wild foods. Since there is a danger of permanent loss of knowledge on the use of wild edibles, we focused our research on recording traditions local to this area. Methods: We conducted interviews with 180 residents. Results: A record was made of 136 species of wild food plants and 22 species of edible mushrooms gathered in the area. The most frequently collected species are Rubus ulmifolius Schott, Cornus mas L., Portulaca oleracea L., Asparagus acutifolius L., Sonchus spp., Morus spp., Taraxacum spp., Amaranthus retroflexus L., Cichorium intybus L., and Dioscorea communis (L.) Caddick & Wilkin. Conclusions: The list of taxa used is typical for other (sub-)Mediterranean parts of Croatia; however, more fungi species are used. The most important finding of the paper is probably the recording of Legousia speculum-veneris (L.) Chaix, a wild vegetable used in the area.

Abstract: Background: Education is, after gaming, the second largest sector embracing augmented reality (AR) at an accelerated pace, yet studies on AR's potential as an efficient learning environment had mixed results. Objectives: This study's primary objective is to test students' interaction with graphical 3D elements in AR and its impact on information retention. The second objective is to compare information retention from AR engagement with information retention from exposure to identical 3D content delivered via instructional video. Finally, the third objective explores students' perceptions of AR as a learning environment. Methods: Sixty-five college students participated in a two-arm experiment followed by semi-structured interviews. Results and Conclusion: AR can efficiently deliver a meaningful learning experience and promotes information retention. Nevertheless, AR's interactive features and novelty may distract learners while they engage with the virtual environment. Objective data obtained through eye tracking and video monitoring showed similar levels of engagement with a 3D model for both environments. While both AR and video groups showed significant knowledge gain from pre to post-intervention, the video format was overall significantly more effective than AR in increasing topic-related information retention. However, participants preferred the AR learning environment significantly more than the video. Takeaways: Although effective, AR is still a distracting instructional environment. Designing learning experiences tailored explicitly for AR environments requires additional research to ensure its successful deployment as a learning tool.

Abstract: Aim/Purpose: This paper addresses the effectiveness of flipped learning and teaching as a didactic innovation in math instruction. We are interested in comparing traditional and flipped learning and teaching in terms of acquired knowledge and retention and students' perceptions of flipped learning and teaching. Background: Traditional lessons, in which frontal instruction prevails, cannot sufficiently address all students, especially in more complex subjects where it is necessary to follow the didactic principle of learning differentiation and individualization. Flipped learning and teaching is a didactic innovation with a high potential for implementing the said didactic principle, as it can be adapted to the students' needs to a greater extent. There is no single mode of implementation for flipped learning and teaching, which means that the effects depend largely on the specific learning activities, resulting in the fact that previous research does not report conclusive results. Thus, it is important to continue to examine this innovation to provide a better and more detailed understanding of it. Methodology: We present a study in which 13-year-old primary school students took part in a pedagogical experiment in mathematics instruction. In the control group (n = 26), lessons were taught in the traditional way, while in the experimental group (n = 26), lessons were taught according to the principle of flipped learning and teaching. After the experiment, the same posttest was administered to both groups to assess the students' knowledge of the subject matter after the treatment. Another posttest was administered after three months to determine whether the knowledge acquired through flipped learning and teaching was permanent. All three tests consisted of 13 tasks, with the first 6 tasks relating to the perimeter of polygons and the second 6 tasks relating to the area of polygons. The last task focused on the perimeter and area of polygons. A short survey was also conducted to find out how the students in the experimental group perceived this didactic innovation in terms of motivation to learn, interest in the subject matter, level of knowledge acquired, and so forth. Contribution: Our research on flipped learning and teaching focusing on primary schools is significant as previous research on the topic has often been conducted on a sample of high school students and even more often on university students. Our particular contribution is the fact that we tested not only the students' immediate knowledge after the intervention but also the retention of knowledge after a period of three months, which provides an additional perspective on the effectiveness of flipped learning and teaching. Findings: With this research, we have answered three research questions. First, we found that there are no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of acquired knowledge. Thus, we found that both the traditional approach and the flipped learning and teaching approach were equally successful in transferring knowledge to the students. In addition, we found that there were differences between the two groups in terms of retention of knowledge. The group taught with the flipped learning and teaching approach showed higher levels of knowledge retention than the group taught with the traditional approach. Finally, it was found that the students were quite satisfied with this approach and would like to see such innovations in the future. Recommendations for Practitioners: The results suggest better knowledge retention when using flipped teaching and learning, so based on our findings, we recommend teachers try this innovation in their classrooms. However, all innovation should be implemented with thorough consideration and gradually; thus, we believe that training courses on flipped learning and teaching should be organized for teachers to learn about this innovation, find out about its effectiveness, and reflect on how they can incorporate it into their own practice. Recommendation for Researchers: We recommend that research in the future focus more on primary school students, with particular attention to experimental design. We suggest that researchers focus on investigating the contribution of the different learning activities with the flipped instructional design to the overall effectiveness of the innovation. Impact on Society: The results of our research thus represent an important contribution to the field of pedagogy and general didactics at primary and lower secondary levels. Based on our findings on knowledge retention in the experimental group, we consider flipped learning and teaching to be an effective innovation that could contribute to a higher quality of teaching and, thus, to better student knowledge. Future Research: Future research would be important to determine which factor ensures a higher level of knowledge retention in a flipped learning and teaching approach than in a traditional learning and teaching approach. It would also be important to determine the effects of flipped learning and teaching in other subject matters in the mathematics classroom, in other age groups of students, and in other subjects in primary school.

Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this paper is to explore how the involvement of workplace teams in experimenting with changes in their work practices through short, time-boxed, experiments (STBEs) can support organizational learning. It is explored how staffs' experiences with experimental practices give rise to shared knowledge and how this is supported by the design of the STBE-procedure. Also explored is how the STBEs support knowledge retainment. Design/methodology/approach: The study builds on the authors' participation in a research and development project across seven financial enterprises in Denmark. Qualitative material was developed as part of the experiments. Theoretically emphasizing experience, knowledge creation through dialogue and knowledge retention, the material was analyzed, focusing on participants' experiences and interactions, as well as on procedures. Findings: The STBEs occasioned direct experience with new work practices for managers and employees. Supported by the STBE-procedure, these experiences generated new knowledge individually, collectively and on an organizational level. The procedure also created routines that can underpin the retainment of the new practices and knowledge related to incorporating it in the organization. Research limitations/implications: The study implicates experience with changes in work practices to be understood as predominantly mindful in opposition to simple, even when the changes appear to be simple. Practical implications: The STBEs are applicable when working with organizational learning related to new work practices. Procedures supporting dialogue and mindful processes appear to be advantageous in relation to learning from experiments. Originality/value: Based on an original research and development project and unique qualitative material, the study adds to discussions on how to best conduct and learn from experiments in organizations.

Abstract: Employee turnover introduces several risks, including loss of knowledge, delayed timelines, reduced productivity, quality issues, and reduced morale. When team members leave, they take their expertise and knowledge with them. This can be especially problematic if they were vital contributors to the project or had specialized skills. When team members leave, productivity may decrease due to the need to train new team employees, adjust to changes in team dynamics, and deal with the administrative tasks associated with turnover. A follow-on consequence is that new team members may have a different experience or understanding of the project requirements than those working on the project for an extended period. This can lead to quality issues and errors in the final product. A work environment with frequent turnover can lead to low morale among remaining team members, who may feel overworked or uncertain about the project's future. The impacts of these risks lead to increased costs in the product life cycle trickling down to the customer or impacting the business financials directly. Turnover can result in increased costs, such as hiring and training new team members or paying for overtime to make up for lost time to mitigate these risks. It is essential to have a solid plan for managing turnover, including documenting processes and procedures, cross-training team members, and developing a knowledge management strategy.

Abstract: Aim . To assess the efficacy of a low-cost haemorrhage-control task simulator integrated in a high-fidelity simulation scenario to facilitate knowledge and practical skills acquisition, as well as self-efficacy in haemorrhage control among nursing students. Design . A quasiexperimental before-after design was conducted at the University of Almeria. Methods . A one-group preintervention, immediate postintervention, and a third assessment at three months were performed, with the Stop the Bleed Education Assessment Tool used to evaluate knowledge of haemorrhage control, as well as a 5-point Likert scale used to evaluate perceived self-efficacy. The success of controlling exsanguinating bleeding was determined by quantifying the millilitres lost during the intervention and calculating the time required to control the haemorrhaging. The data were reported using the TREND guidelines. Results . One hundred and three final-year nursing students participated in this study. Significant improvements ( p < 0.001 ) were observed in pre- and posttest total scores on knowledge of bleeding control, self-efficacy, as well as time is taken and volume loss to control the haemorrhage. Similar results were observed between preassessment and three months postassessment with significant improvements ( p < 0.001 ) in all measures. Conclusions . The use of a haemorrhage-control task simulator within a high-fidelity simulation scenario resulted in noteworthy improvements in nursing students’ practical skills, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy. After three months, performance decreased but remained greater than pretraining levels. Thus, broadening the use of this task-training simulator would be of great value to further develop a first responder training approach with healthcare professionals and other laypersons, allowing for greater knowledge distribution and reaching a larger audience. Implications for Nursing Management . The findings underscore the potential efficacy of this simulator as a valuable resource for nursing educators and supervisors to train nursing students and professionals in terms of practical skills, knowledge retention, and self-efficacy in haemorrhage control, fostering a train-the-trainer cascade approach to reach a wider audience and enhance bleeding control proficiency among professionals.

Abstract: Keywords: professionalism, medical education, clinical clerkship, medical student, curriculum Introduction Considering the complexity of healthcare systems, the increasing demands for high-quality healthcare require the complete readiness of medical doctors who have sufficient knowledge, skills and attitudes for medical practice. [...]medical schools must ensure the attainment of these competencies, which require dynamic adaptation in educating and training future fit-for-practice medical doctors and lifelong learners (1). [...]professional development programmes in medical school curricula have focused more on professionalism lapses, remediation (12, 13), and knowledge retention of the concept of professionalism rather than its practice (14). [...]arguably, teaching humanism and professionalism should be conducted explicitly during clinical years when professional values maybe compromised (14). By sharing their experiences and perspectives on learning, students have identified situational challenges and suggested solutions and innovations for the curriculum (16, 17). [...]this study aims to explore how medical students perceive learning professionalism in clinical settings. Data Collection and Analysis Three FGDs were conducted online for about 1 h to 1.5 h for each FGD in Bahasa Indonesia.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/evaluation-model-students-english-learning/docview/2937273381/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Students’ English learning ability depends on the knowledge and practice provided during the teaching sessions. Besides, language usage improves the self-ability to scale up the learning levels for professional communication. Therefore, the appraisal identification and ability estimation are expected to be consistent for different English learning levels. This paper introduces Performance Data-based Appraisal Identification Model (PDAIM) to support such reference. This proposed model is computed using fuzzy logic to identify learning level lags. The lag in performance and retains in scaling-up are identified using different fuzzification levels. The study suggests a fuzzy logic model pinpointing learning level gaps and consistently evaluating performance across various English learning levels. The PDAIM model gathers high and low degrees of variance in the learning process to give students flexible learning knowledge. Based on the student’s performance and capacity for knowledge retention, it enables scaling up the learning levels for professional communication. The performance measure in the model is adjusted to accommodate the student’s diverse grades within discernible assessment boundaries. This individualized method offers focused education and advancement to students’ unique requirements and skills. The model contains continuous normalization to enhance the fuzzification process by employing prior lags and retentions. Several indicators, including appraisal rate, lag detection, number of retentions, data analysis rate, and analysis time, are used to validate the PDAIM model’s performance. The model may adjust to the various performance levels and offer pertinent feedback using fuzzification. The high and low variation levels in the learning process are accumulated to provide adaptable learning knowledge to the students. Therefore, the performance measure is modified to fit the student’s various grades under distinguishable appraisal limits. If a consistent appraisal level from the fuzzification is observed for continuous sessions, then the learning is scaled up to the next level, failing, which results in retention. This proposed model occupies constant normalization for improving the fuzzification using previous lags and retentions. Hence the performance of this model is validated using appraisal rate, lag detection, number of retentions, data analysis rate, and analysis time.

Abstract: The lack of succession plans can lead to organizational knowledge loss. Small business leaders are concerned with succession planning, which can lead to company closures. Grounded in Woodworth and Thorndike’s knowledge transfer for succession planning theory, the purpose of this qualitative single case study was to explore strategies small business leaders use to develop and implement succession plans. The participants were two small business owners of a health sector organization in the Midwestern United States who implemented succession plans to prevent organization knowledge loss. Data were collected using the Baldrige Excellence Framework, semistructured interviews, and a review of organizational documents. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis; three themes emerged: (a) employee and leadership audits, (b) career mapping for succession planning, and (c) shadowing, training, developing, and strategic depth. A key recommendation is for organizational leaders to develop career maps for employees. The implications for positive social change include the potential for employees to fulfill organizational sustainability leadership roles, employee job retention, and thus, employee economic contribution to the community.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Micro-learning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students' accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.

Abstract: Paleontological site monitoring in National Park Service units can deviate from the recommended cyclical protocol because of unique challenges each unit may face. These challenges include staffing limitations or turnover, difficulty accessing remote sites, and high work volume. Insufficient monitoring of fossil sites might result in the loss of knowledge or data due to degradation or loss of resources. New monitoring protocols were tested at the Copper Canyon ichnofossil locality in Death Valley National Park (DEVA) to address the highlighted management challenges. The monitoring protocol presented here was designed to be streamlined and simple, to be utilized by paleontologists and non-paleontologists alike, and to overcome challenges, thereby, improving undermanaged sites. The monitoring protocol included baseline evaluation and imaging of the 78 track localities within Copper Canyon. Each site was assigned a sensitivity status; identifying its recommended monitoring cyclicity of high, moderate, or low. It was determined that monitors could take as few as two held trips to Copper Canyon per year and monitor between five to ten sites each trip. This could be accomplished by DEVA's resources management, interpretation, or law enforcement staff, or a volunteer. Monitors use a portable device, pre-loaded with site-specific paleontological data, to interactively record changes at a site and complete a short seven question form with their observations. Data are stored on the device and later transferred to a central paleontological database. Through this protocol, DEVA can utilize a community-based approach to better manage fossil resources, one which could be replicated by other National Park Service units that grapple with similar monitoring challenges.

Abstract: Background Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory skin condition that is associated with poor acne health literacy. Diminished acne health literacy leads to delays in the access of health care, resulting in mismanagement, disfigurement, and psychosocial morbidity. This study evaluates the potential role of early acne education in young adolescent populations to improve acne health literacy and facilitate help‐seeking behavior. Methods The Acne Education Project is a Canadian medical student‐led initiative founded to create evidence‐based resources to increase acne health literacy. A 45‐min interactive Zoom presentation on acne was created and delivered to 2292 students ages 9–13 in British Columbia, Canada. A quality improvement survey was administered pre‐intervention, immediate post‐intervention, and 1‐month post‐intervention to evaluate baseline acne knowledge and knowledge retention to guide presentation and resource development. Results Responses from 676 unique individuals were collected. Analysis using linear mixed‐effects models demonstrated that respondents were significantly more confident in their general knowledge of acne, strategies to prevent acne, identification of psychosocial sequelae of acne, and more willing to seek help immediately post‐intervention ( p  < .001). Differences in scores were not fully preserved in magnitude at the 1‐month post‐intervention assessment. However, students still scored significantly higher in all categories compared to the pre‐intervention baseline ( p  < .001). Conclusion Our findings suggest that early acne education can improve acne health literacy and promote help‐seeking behavior . Given the potential long‐term implications, further research is needed to explore the long‐term impact of early acne education and the benefit of integrating acne education into the public education curriculum in Canada.

Abstract: This study examines the effects of implementing a Flipped Mobile-Based Microlearning (FMM) approach on postgraduate students’ accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and academic achievement. A quantitative multiple methods approach was employed, utilising a two-group quasi-experimental design and a survey questionnaire to gather data. The results suggest that the FMM approach may have positive effects on accessibility, engagement, knowledge retention, overall learning experience and final exam scores when compared to the traditional learning approach. The findings support the efficacy of integrating FMM, highlighting its potential for enhancing the learning process and academic outcomes. These results have implications for educational practice and research, emphasising the value of technology-enhanced learning approaches, active and interactive learning experiences and the promotion of student motivation and attitudes towards learning. This study underscores the broader applicability of FMM and suggests its potential for improving educational outcomes across different educational levels and subject areas.

Abstract: Orientation: South African state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are facing a perpetual struggle of institutional tacit knowledge loss, which poses a risk to these entities and threatens their sustainability. The research project endeavoured to tackle these challenges from knowledge management (KM) and human resource management (HRM) perspectives and proposes a plethora of integrated knowledge-driven HRM processes to mitigate risks associated with loss of tacit knowledge. Research purpose: The study provides an integrated understanding of the issues relating to the causes of enterprise tacit knowledge loss and extent to which there is recognition of company knowledge loss in selected SOEs in South Africa. Motivation for the study: There is limited research that provides an integrated approach to tacit knowledge loss from KM and HRM standpoints. Research approach/design and method: The exploratory sequential mixed-methods research design was used in this study. In the qualitative phase of this research, data were collected from the annual reports of the SOEs and unstructured interviews with 20 purposively selected human resource (HR) managers, which was subsequently analysed thematically using ATLAS.ti software. The quantitative data from 145 out of 585 respondents were analysed statistically using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS). Main findings: The study revealed that organisational tacit knowledge loss is largely caused by voluntary and involuntary employee turnover and a lack of retention strategies. This adversely affects the knowledge base and the knowledge absorptive and protective capacities of the SOEs. Practical implications/managerial implications: The study concludes that the journey for ensuring effective knowledge transfer and retention of valuable enterprise knowledge starts with the appreciation of knowledge as a key firm-specific strategic issue. Contribution/value-add: This study offers an integrated understanding of the causes of tacit knowledge loss for effective management in SOEs researched interdependently from KM and HRM perspectives.

Abstract: Background: The study argues that managing tacit knowledge (TKM) would reduce small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operational discontinuity and knowledge loss in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. Objectives: The article examined the strategies put in place by SMEs for tacit knowledge management (TKM) practices and to develop a framework that will promote TKM for SMEs. Method: The study adopted a quantitative research method and targeted 326 SMEs using Google Forms. One hundred and eighty (180; 55.2%) useful responses were obtained and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Results: Most of the SME owners are aware and affirmed that there is a particular tacit knowledge that is of importance to business. The most common methods of capturing tacit knowledge among SMEs are monitoring, practical sessions, in-house training programmes, and brainstorming. Tacit knowledge is shared during meetings (such as project teams) and when dialoguing. The study also revealed that electronic files in computers are the major tools for storing the collected tacit knowledge. Conclusion: The study concluded that TKM among SMEs in KZN required improvement and recommended improving teams and informal networks and making information and communication technology tools available to preserve tacit knowledge. The SMEs that can afford it can consider employing the services of consultant knowledge management officers to conduct periodic knowledge audits to identify knowledge gaps for proactive solutions. Contribution: The study contributed to knowledge management, tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, and TKM.

Abstract: Purpose The aim of this paper is to explore how the involvement of workplace teams in experimenting with changes in their work practices through short, time-boxed, experiments (STBEs) can support organizational learning. It is explored how staffs’ experiences with experimental practices give rise to shared knowledge and how this is supported by the design of the STBE-procedure. Also explored is how the STBEs support knowledge retainment. Design/methodology/approach The study builds on the authors’ participation in a research and development project across seven financial enterprises in Denmark. Qualitative material was developed as part of the experiments. Theoretically emphasizing experience, knowledge creation through dialogue and knowledge retention, the material was analyzed, focusing on participants’ experiences and interactions, as well as on procedures. Findings The STBEs occasioned direct experience with new work practices for managers and employees. Supported by the STBE-procedure, these experiences generated new knowledge individually, collectively and on an organizational level. The procedure also created routines that can underpin the retainment of the new practices and knowledge related to incorporating it in the organization. Research limitations/implications The study implicates experience with changes in work practices to be understood as predominantly mindful in opposition to simple, even when the changes appear to be simple. Practical implications The STBEs are applicable when working with organizational learning related to new work practices. Procedures supporting dialogue and mindful processes appear to be advantageous in relation to learning from experiments. Originality/value Based on an original research and development project and unique qualitative material, the study adds to discussions on how to best conduct and learn from experiments in organizations.

Abstract: The objectives of this research were to educate those who consume an inadequate amount of dairy (less than 3 servings of dairy per day) about various topics related to dairy nutrition, test retention of information, and motivate purchasing and consumption of dairy products. Twenty-four nominal focus group (NFG) sessions were conducted (Ames, IA: April 2021, 10, n = 94; Manhattan, KS: 6 in July 2021 and 8 in October 2021, n = 101). The NFG were randomly assigned into control or treatment groups. The control only received a nutrition facts panel (NFP) label lesson. Treatment groups received the NFP label lesson, plus one of 3 different educational messages (EM; lactose maldigestion, 9 essential nutrients, and prebiotics and probiotics). Identical scripts were followed, except for the EM and infographics. Participants completed surveys at the beginning (pre-survey) and end (post-survey) of the NFG, and 1 mo later (follow-up). A total of 195 participants completed the NFG and pre- and post-surveys; 185 of those completed the follow-up survey. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were run to determine if individuals learned and retained information and if they changed purchasing or consumption. Participants learned about dairy nutrition topics (validated by correct responses in survey questions) and increased their consumption and purchasing of cheese, ice cream, milk, and yogurt by at least 20% after participating in an NFG. Consumption did not increase enough for those who consume an inadequate amount of dairy to meet the recommended 21 servings of dairy per week. Adjustments to the EM and infographics may improve learning, knowledge retention, and more meaningfully increase dairy purchasing and consumption.The objectives of this research were to educate those who consume an inadequate amount of dairy (less than 3 servings of dairy per day) about various topics related to dairy nutrition, test retention of information, and motivate purchasing and consumption of dairy products.

Abstract: Increasing age diversity in the workplace has led to growing research attention to the knowledge transfer between older and younger employees. The existing literature on age‐diverse knowledge exchange has mostly focused on knowledge transfer from older to younger employees as a means of knowledge retention. In this study, we change perspectives by aiming to understand how and when older employees' knowledge seeking from younger coworkers is related to their successful aging at work (i.e., the motivation and ability to continue working). Grounded in the self‐regulatory process model of successful aging at work, we predict two countervailing pathways: a positive self‐enhancing path via perceived learning and a negative self‐protective path via embarrassment. In a time‐lagged study with 764 older employees, we found that their knowledge seeking from younger coworkers was positively related to motivation to continue working and workability via perceived learning and negatively related to workability via embarrassment. We further examined older employees' positive intergenerational affect as a boundary condition and found a buffering effect on the negative path to workability. This research shows that knowledge transfer from younger to older employees is a net contributor to successful aging at work and embarrassment can be mitigated by positive intergenerational affect.

Abstract: Purpose This paper aims to propose an innovative method for deploying a personalized instructor-created software-aided assessment system, that will disrupt traditional learning environments by allowing students to confidentially and with indirect supervision from the instructor, assess their knowledge and ability to achieve the course outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Through empirical evaluation in real-world educational settings, the authors examine the impact of augmenting human activity in the classroom with an innovative software platform to transform the learning process. Findings Findings indicate that this software-aided assessment system effectively augments human interactivity by providing timely instructor-designed feedback to increase knowledge retention and skillsets. Practical implications This study has shown that incorporating disruptive innovation through the use of software-aided assessment systems increases the effectiveness of the faculty in the classroom and enhances student learning and retention. Thus, a transformative software-aided assessment system design that incorporates artificial intelligence into the learning pathway should be pursued. These software-aided assessments are disruptive innovation as they are formative, frequent and require little direct involvement from the instructor. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to incorporate artificial intelligence into the assessment process by analyzing results of pilot programs at several universities. The results demonstrate how using software-aided transformative assessments in various courses have helped instructors assess students’ preparedness and track their learning progress. These software-aided systems are the first step in bringing disruptive innovation to the classroom as these software-aided assessment instruments rapidly assess learners’ knowledge and skills based on short, easily created, multiple-choice tests, with little direct engagement from the faculty.

Abstract: Purpose The paper aims to explore “content” factors influencing consumptive and contributive use of enterprise social networking within UK higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The methodology uses genre analysis and grounded theory to analyse empirical data from posts obtained through Microsoft Yammer and a focus group. Findings The findings reveal the motivators-outcomes-strategies and the barriers-outcomes-strategies of users. Motivators (M) include feature value, Information value, organizational requirement and adequate organizational and technical support. Barriers (B) include six factors, including resisting engagement on the online platform, emotional anxiety, loss of knowledge, the lack of organizational pressure, lack of content quality and lack of time. An Outcomes (O) framework reveals benefits and dis-benefits and strategies (S) relating to improving user engagement. Practical implications The research method and resultant model may serve as guidelines to higher educational establishments interested in motivating their staff and scholars around the use of enterprise social network (ESN) systems, especially during face-to-face restrictions. Originality/value This research study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic which provides a unique setting to examine consumptive and contributive user behaviour of ESN’s. Furthermore, the study develops a greater understanding of “content” factors leading to the benefits or dis-benefits of ESN use, drawing on user motivators, barriers and strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK education.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate a framework for knowledge retention to support business continuity in cross-border mergers of the telecommunications industry in Lesotho. Design/methodology/approach This study applied a qualitative case study, with data collected through interviews from a purposively selected sample of staff members who held managerial positions. Information in this study was partially extracted from the PhD thesis of Dr Tseole ET supervised by Prof Ngulube P at the University of South Africa completed in 2021. Findings The study discovered that a considerable amount of knowledge may have been lost because employees who either left the organisation or those who were apparently forced to resign during the process had left without any proper knowledge retention arrangements. Research limitations/implications The framework proposed in this study may be used in framing future studies as a theoretical framework. The study also provides new literature for review and discussion of background in future related studies. Practical implications The framework provided in the study may be used as a benchmark in the knowledge management industry and/or organisations for policy development or improvements and implementation of knowledge retention strategies. Social implications Through recommendations and framework provided by this study, organisations will be able to improve their services to their sphere of influence in the surrounding communities. So, community will be receiving an improved and good service at all the times. Originality/value A framework for facilitating knowledge retention in the cross-border mergers of the telecommunications industry is therefore proposed and the researchers believe it will be helpful to the organisation for improving knowledge retention going forward, particularly in the merger process.

Abstract: Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory skin condition that is associated with poor acne health literacy. Diminished acne health literacy leads to delays in the access of health care, resulting in mismanagement, disfigurement, and psychosocial morbidity. This study evaluates the potential role of early acne education in young adolescent populations to improve acne health literacy and facilitate help-seeking behavior. BACKGROUND Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory skin condition that is associated with poor acne health literacy. Diminished acne health literacy leads to delays in the access of health care, resulting in mismanagement, disfigurement, and psychosocial morbidity. This study evaluates the potential role of early acne education in young adolescent populations to improve acne health literacy and facilitate help-seeking behavior.The Acne Education Project is a Canadian medical student-led initiative founded to create evidence-based resources to increase acne health literacy. A 45-min interactive Zoom presentation on acne was created and delivered to 2292 students ages 9-13 in British Columbia, Canada. A quality improvement survey was administered pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention to evaluate baseline acne knowledge and knowledge retention to guide presentation and resource development. METHODS The Acne Education Project is a Canadian medical student-led initiative founded to create evidence-based resources to increase acne health literacy. A 45-min interactive Zoom presentation on acne was created and delivered to 2292 students ages 9-13 in British Columbia, Canada. A quality improvement survey was administered pre-intervention, immediate post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention to evaluate baseline acne knowledge and knowledge retention to guide presentation and resource development.Responses from 676 unique individuals were collected. Analysis using linear mixed-effects models demonstrated that respondents were significantly more confident in their general knowledge of acne, strategies to prevent acne, identification of psychosocial sequelae of acne, and more willing to seek help immediately post-intervention (p < .001). Differences in scores were not fully preserved in magnitude at the 1-month post-intervention assessment. However, students still scored significantly higher in all categories compared to the pre-intervention baseline (p < .001). RESULTS Responses from 676 unique individuals were collected.

Abstract: Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) is an uncommon but potentially lifesaving procedure that warrants familiarity with anatomy, instruments, and indications necessary for completion. To address this need, we developed a low-cost EDT trainer. The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a low-cost EDT trainer to teach emergency department thoracotomy with a discussion-based teaching session. Secondary objective was to study the face validity of the low-cost EDT trainer.

To address this need, we developed a low-cost EDT trainer. The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of a low-cost EDT trainer to teach emergency department thoracotomy with a discussion-based teaching session. Secondary objective was to study the face validity of the low-cost EDT trainer.A prospective 2-phase randomized control study was conducted. Participants were randomly divided into two groups. In phase one, baseline medical knowledge for both groups was assessed using a multiple-choice question pretest. In Group 1, each participant was taught EDT using a one-on-one discussion with a trauma surgeon, whereas Group 2 used the EDT trainer and debriefing for training. In phase 2 (1 month later), all participants completed a knowledge retention test and performed a videoed EDT using our EDT trainer, the video recordings were later reviewed by content experts blinded to the study participants using a checklist with a maximum score of 22. The participants also completed a reaction survey at the end of phase 2 of the study. DESIGN A prospective 2-phase randomized control study was conducted.

SETTING OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital, an urban tertiary care academic hospital in Columbus, Ohio.Nine senior surgery residents from training years 3 to 5. PARTICIPANTS Nine senior surgery residents from training years 3 to 5.The mean score for the performance of the procedure for the simulation-based (Group 2) was significantly higher than that of the discussion-based (Group 1) (Rater 1: 21.2 ± 0.8 vs. 19.0 ± 2.0, p = 0.05, Rater 2: 20.4 ± 1.5 vs. 18.3±1.0, p = 0.04). Group 2 also was quicker than Group 1 in deciding to start the procedure by approximately 56 seconds. When comparing the mean pretest knowledge score to the mean knowledge retention score 30 days after training, the discussion-based group improved from 58.33% to 81.25% (p = 0.01); the simulation-trained group's scores remained at 68.33%. All the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the simulator provided a realistic opportunity to perform EDT and improved their confidence. RESULTS The mean score for the performance of the procedure for the simulation-based (Group 2) was significantly higher than that of the discussion-based (Group 1) (Rater 1: 21.2 ± 0.8 vs. 19.0 ± 2.0, p = 0.05, Rater 2: 20.4 ± 1.5 vs. 18.3±1.0, p = 0.04). Group 2 also was quicker than Group 1 in deciding to start the procedure by approximately 56 seconds. When comparing the mean pretest knowledge score to the mean knowledge retention score 30 days after training, the discussion-based group improved from 58.33% to 81.25% (p = 0.01); the simulation-trained group's scores remained at 68.33%. All the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the simulator provided a realistic opportunity to perform EDT and improved their confidence.The results of this pilot study support our hypothesis that using a low-cost EDT trainer effectively improves general surgery residents' confidence and procedural skills scores in a simulated environment. Further training with low-cost simulators may provide surgical residents with deliberate practice opportunities and improve performance when learning low-frequency procedures. CONCLUSIONS The results of this pilot study support our hypothesis that using a low-cost EDT trainer effectively improves general surgery residents' confidence and procedural skills scores in a simulated environment. Further training with low-cost simulators may provide surgical residents with deliberate practice opportunities and improve performance when learning low-frequency procedures.

Abstract: Increasing age diversity in the workplace has led to growing research attention to the knowledge transfer between older and younger employees. The existing literature on age‐diverse knowledge exchange has mostly focused on knowledge transfer from older to younger employees as a means of knowledge retention. In this study, we change perspectives by aiming to understand how and when older employees' knowledge seeking from younger coworkers is related to their successful aging at work (i.e., the motivation and ability to continue working). Grounded in the self‐regulatory process model of successful aging at work, we predict two countervailing pathways: a positive self‐enhancing path via perceived learning and a negative self‐protective path via embarrassment. In a time‐lagged study with 764 older employees, we found that their knowledge seeking from younger coworkers was positively related to motivation to continue working and workability via perceived learning and negatively related to workability via embarrassment. We further examined older employees' positive intergenerational affect as a boundary condition and found a buffering effect on the negative path to workability. This research shows that knowledge transfer from younger to older employees is a net contributor to successful aging at work and embarrassment can be mitigated by positive intergenerational affect.

Abstract: Background: While progress has been made to decrease mortality in children under age five, there continues to be a need for improvement in the treatment of children with congenital heart disease. Many of these patients require surgical correction and live in areas without the expertise of surgical teams. Research has shown that appropriate training is critical to ensure the best clinical outcomes. The Ethiopian government has identified the need for increased training of health care professionals as a method to improve hospital outcomes. Methods: Twenty-five cardiac critical nurses participated in a remote didactic education curriculum over the course of multiple months. We used a pre- and post-test model to evaluate knowledge acquisition and retention after the curriculum. Nurses completed post-tests at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals to monitor knowledge retention over time. Results: We found a significant increase in nursing knowledge that was retained over the course of 12 months. Nursing knowledge on pre- and post-tests was impacted by experience level. However, after completion of the curriculum experience was not a significant factor. Conclusion: Virtual curriculum delivered via remote didactic education is an inexpensive and effective way to increase nursing knowledge in cardiac critical care. It encourages bidirectional learning and allows the sharing of expertise from individuals who may otherwise be limited by travel or finances. Our approach is generalizable and further research needs to be done to evaluate the effectiveness of this type of curriculum in other environments.Background: While progress has been made to decrease mortality in children under age five, there continues to be a need for improvement in the treatment of children with congenital heart disease.
