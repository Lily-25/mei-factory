Abstract: This study aims to explore GP residents' knowledge retention and residents' and clinical teachers' perception on the learning value of a dermatology E-learning programme. OBJECTIVES This study aims to explore GP residents' knowledge retention and residents' and clinical teachers' perception on the learning value of a dermatology E-learning programme.The study used a mixed-method design with a convergent parallel collection of data. GP residents (n=21) were selected through purposive sampling and were randomized to an E-learning group (n=12) or a traditional teaching methods group (n=9). The pre-and post-intervention knowledge tests of the E-learning group were compared using paired-samples t-tests. Post-knowledge tests scores of both groups were compared using independent t-tests. Cronbach's coefficient α was used to calculate the internal consistency of the questions used in the knowledge tests. Individual semi-structured interviews and clinical teachers (n=16) were conducted and analyzed using King's template analysis.

Cronbach's coefficient α was used to calculate the internal consistency of the questions used in the knowledge tests. Individual semi-structured interviews and clinical teachers (n=16) were conducted and analyzed using King's template analysis.The E-learning group showed a significant increase in mean knowledge test scores from 58.92% (SD=9.55%) to 64.92% (SD=13.65%) (t (11) =2.258, p=0.045, Cohen's d=0.51). The pre-knowledge test consisted of 46 items (Alpha=0.78), and the post-knowledge tests consisted of 45 items (Alpha=0.90). Interview data showed that the E-learning programme aided GP trainees' learning process and favoured a mixed-method teaching design, in which E-learning is used in parallel to the traditional teaching methods. RESULTS The E-learning group showed a significant increase in mean knowledge test scores from 58.92% (SD=9.55%) to 64.92% (SD=13.65%) (t(11)=2.258, p=0.045, Cohen's d=0.51).

The key users' perceptions, both residents and clinical teachers, indicated that E-learning was feasible and helpful for learning processes. Further research is required to evaluate the implementation of E-learning programmes in parallel to regular teaching programs.

Abstract: Many schools raise children with significantly lower levels of academic achievement who flourish in disadvantaged communities. Early in children's lives, even before kindergarten, these educational shortcomings arise and develop through childhood. This research observed some directions that affect cognitive development in early years to 5 years using family socioeconomic position (SEP). In this research, upbringing, fitness, wellbeing, and family relationships are examined and referred to as the early childhood care system. Such factors have been rarely tested in massive datasets together to preclude a systematic scientific study of their position as predictors and effects of adverse child outcomes. The study aims to explore the cognitive development framework (CDF) for early cognizance and shows that several sources have effects: earnings, childcare, the home atmosphere, and the neighborhood of single parenthood. As part of this research, researchers looked at the cognitive development framework (CDF) for early cognizance. They found that several factors impacted, including incomes, daycare, home environment, and neighborhood. The income seems to be a significant independent indicator of the gradient of cognitive growth. The most critical influence is the effect of “length of exposure” and “intensity” based on poverty depth. The whole research enables us to recognize the relative strengths of the most potent health consequences, giving valuable information into how they're being tackled. The CDF enhance outcomes of successful children cognitive development ratio of 97.1%, high-performance analysis ratio of 98.5%, improve reliability ratio of 92.1%, improve probability ratio of 98.7%, knowledge retention ratio of 93.1%, improve learning ability skill ratio of 91.9%, prediction ratio of 98.5%, and enhance critical thinking ratio of 94.2% when compared to research methods.

Abstract: ABSTRACT The study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the trends, impacts, and challenges of mobile microlearning (MML) research. Using five academic databases from the fields of social science, engineering, and medical science as search sources, 26 scholarly articles, published between 2015 and 2020, were retrieved. The study applied a content analysis method to analyze and synthesize the data with three focal points: (a) research purposes and publication sources; (b) research settings, including learning domains, contexts, research methods, measures, and participants; and (c) research outcomes, advantages, and challenges of MML based on the reviewed literature. Results indicated that the mixed-method approach has become a trend in MML studies and MML has been widely applied in both formal and informal settings, especially in the just-in-time workplace learning. In terms of advantages, MML not only enhanced learners’ achievement and motivation but also improved skills and knowledge retention. Some deficiencies of MML that were identified included the need for further investigation on meaningful designs of microcontents to fit into small screen mobile devices and issues of usability. The paper discusses implications for researchers and practitioners. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Information learned over a longer period of time has been shown to result in better long-term knowledge retention than information learned over a shorter period of time. In order to address multiple curricular goals, the timing and spacing of anatomy content within the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program at our institution recently changed from a very spaced to a very compressed format. The purpose of the present study was to assess differences in anatomy knowledge retention that might have been impacted by this change. The research hypothesis was that students receiving spaced instruction would have significantly better anatomy knowledge retention than students receiving massed instruction. BACKGROUND Information learned over a longer period of time has been shown to result in better long-term knowledge retention than information learned over a shorter period of time. In order to address multiple curricular goals, the timing and spacing of anatomy content within the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program at our institution recently changed from a very spaced to a very compressed format. The purpose of the present study was to assess differences in anatomy knowledge retention that might have been impacted by this change. The research hypothesis was that students receiving spaced instruction would have significantly better anatomy knowledge retention than students receiving massed instruction.Participants consisted of two cohorts of DPT students that both received 45 contact hours of anatomy lecture and 90 contact hours of anatomy lab. The LONG cohort experienced anatomy through a lecture and lab taught over a 30-week, 2 semester period as separate courses. In contrast, the SHORT cohort took their anatomy lecture and lab concurrently over one 10-week semester. A pre-test was administered on the first day of their anatomy lecture course, and a post-test was administered to each cohort 18 months after completion of their last anatomy exam. METHODS Participants consisted of two cohorts of DPT students that both received 45 contact hours of anatomy lecture and 90 contact hours of anatomy lab. The LONG cohort experienced anatomy through a lecture and lab taught over a 30-week, 2 semester period as separate courses. In contrast, the SHORT cohort took their anatomy lecture and lab concurrently over one 10-week semester. A pre-test was administered on the first day of their anatomy lecture course, and a post-test was administered to each cohort 18 months after completion of their last anatomy exam.After controlling for age-related differences in the two groups, no significant differences in mean pre-test, post-test, or percentage improvement were found between cohorts (p = 0.516; 0.203; and 0.152, respectively). RESULTS After controlling for age-related differences in the two groups, no significant differences in mean pre-test, post-test, or percentage improvement were found between cohorts (p = 0.516; 0.203; and 0.152, respectively).These findings refute the hypothesis and show that both spaced and massed instruction in these cohorts resulted in the same level of long-term anatomy knowledge retention. CONCLUSION These findings refute the hypothesis and show that both spaced and massed instruction in these cohorts resulted in the same level of long-term anatomy knowledge retention.

Abstract: Homemade herbal preparations from the East of Spain are the witness of traditional medicine inherited from the ancient complex formulas of herbal teas and medicinal wines. In this study, we document the use of traditional alcoholic beverages, identify their ingredients, almost exclusively botanical, record the local medicinal uses of these mixtures, and discuss patterns of distribution of this knowledge in regions of eastern Spain, the Balearic Islands and Andorra. We determine marker species and relevant patterns of herbal formulas in the different regions of the territory. Homemade liquors and liqueurs are consumed for their digestive and tonic-restorative properties but they also play in some cases an important social role. The elderly remember other medicinal uses such as aperitif, emmenagogue, or antidiarrheal, for some of the most popular preparations. The herbal liqueur formulas include predominantly Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae, and Apiaceae species. Herbs (58%), fruits (28%), and mixtures of both (12%) are ingredients of liquors and wines, being the aerial parts the most frequent in terms of species (30%) and records (49%). Dictamnus hispanicus, Santolina villosa, Salvia blancoana subsp. mariolensis , Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, and Clinopodium serpyllifolium subsp. fruticosum are the species most frequently used. Others species used to a lesser extent as Polygonatum odoratum, Thymus moroderi, and Saxifraga longifolia are restricted to locally homemade preparations because their collection and uses require special knowledge of the rare or endemic flora. Sustainability of these practices is strongly limited by the overall loss of local traditional knowledge and by the limited availability of most of the wild species; some of them are endangered or threatened mainly by the loss of their natural habitats. Cultivation and domestication are a promising alternative to collecting from wild populations. The cultivation of Thymus moroderi in the province of Alicante and Polygonatum odoratum in the province of Teruel are good examples. There is a notable decrease in the complexity of the formulas registered throughout the nearly 15 years of the study. This is interpreted as a consequence of a loss of knowledge, less accessibility to wild resources, and changes in traditions and preferences.

Abstract: Introduction With cancelled student placements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a shift towards non-patient-facing methods to deliver medical education. The aim was to design, deliver and evaluate an ENT course for undergraduate medical students. Method A three-part simulation course on common and emergency ENT conditions was delivered by ENT trainees to undergraduate medical students (n = 50). It involved theoretical and hands-on experience with otoscopy on head models; nasoendoscopy and epistaxis management with upper airway head models and nasal packing kits; and management of compromised airways using critical airway models, airway adjuncts, intubation and cricothyroidotomy kits. Delegates were given pre- and post-course questionnaires, with another at six-weeks to test knowledge retention. Results were statistically analysed using paired and independent sample t-tests. Results A statistically significant improvement in post-test knowledge of 55% ( p <0.01) was observed. Delegates also demonstrated a sustained improvement of 51% ( p <0.01) six-weeks later compared to baseline knowledge. 76% and 80% reported improved confidence managing epistaxis and performing intubation respectively; 46% reported increased interest in pursuing ENT as a potential career. Conclusions This study demonstrated statistically significant and sustained improvements in knowledge about common and emergency ENT concepts. ENT simulation therefore represents an efficacious mechanism for teaching key ENT concepts and improving confidence in undergraduate medical students, whilst improving interest in pursuing ENT as a career. Additionally, simulation is an invaluable educational adjunct that may foster more realistic, impactful, and safer educational experiences for medical students whilst exposure to patients is minimised due to the current pandemic.

Abstract: Introduction Alongside declining ST3 applications, cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) is underrepresented in the medical curriculum with 90% of medical students reporting no exposure to the specialty in medical school placements. This may result in clinicians having difficulties recognising emergency presentations, with subsequent referrals made inappropriately. Method A simulation course involving teaching around common CTS conditions and procedures was delivered by CTS trainees to undergraduate medical students (n = 50). This involved both theory and high-fidelity simulations of coronary anastomoses using cardiac surgical equipment on porcine hearts and ureters. Delegates were given pre and post-test questionnaires, and another at six-weeks to test knowledge retention. Results were statistically analysed using paired and independent sample t-tests. Results Delegates demonstrated significant improvements in post-test knowledge of 56% ( p <0.01), and sustained improvement of 51% ( p <0.01) six-weeks later compared to baseline. 64% of delegates reported an increased interest in pursuing CTS as a career; 40% reported improved confidence performing a coronary anastomosis. Conclusions Immediate and long-term knowledge retention of key CTS concepts and ability to assess common CTS pathological scenarios were demonstrated in this study. CTS simulation therefore represents an effective mechanism by which key concepts can be taught to undergraduate medical students, whilst enhancing interest in pursuing CTS as a career. As an educational adjunct, simulation can help bridge the gap between taught theory and applied practice, with the potential to empower future doctors to make more informed referrals and management decisions.

Abstract: We trace the evolution of research on organizational learning. As organizations acquire experience, their performance typically improves at a decreasing rate. Although this learning-curve pattern is found in many industries, organizations vary in the rate at which they learn. In order to understand this variation, we separate organizational learning into four processes: search, knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer. Within each process, we present research on how dimensions of experience and of the organizational context affect learning processes and outcomes. Our goals are to describe major findings and to identify opportunities for future research. The article concludes with a discussion of research directions that are likely to be productive in the future. These directions include investigating how new technological and organizational developments are likely to affect organizational learning.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important research area in cognitive computation—thus, in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are necessary. At present, rich-resource data-based SA has been well-developed, while the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e., a target-domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom studied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of supervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts), and the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the distinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private knowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain adaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based shared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain-common features and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In the second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared-private architecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first mechanism is a selective domain adaptation ( SDA ) method, which transfers knowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a target-oriented ensemble ( TOE ) method, in which knowledge is transferred through a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations verify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is that transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade the target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose proper source domains to transfer from.

Abstract: Based on theories of learning that suggest that repetition is important for knowledge retention and application, this article hypothesized that sending farmers reminders about cereal management information received during face-to-face training has impact on the adoption of recommended practices and related agricultural outcomes over and above what could be realized after receiving training alone. We provide a test of this hypothesis using a randomized controlled trial in Sikasso, Mali. Farmers in 99 villages received face-to-face training, after which 44 villages received mobile phone voice messages that reinforced the training recommendations. This setup allowed us to evaluate the impact of the voice SMS reminders on selected indicators. Our results show that the reminders significantly induced timely harvesting, reduced on-farm cereal losses, increased uptake of improved grain storage technology, and increased the likelihood of pre-harvest sales contracting. However, we found no overwhelming evidence that the reminders increased yields, and no evidence of impact on revenues were detected. We draw lessons for development policy and practice.

Abstract: We trace the evolution of research on organizational learning. As organizations acquire experience, their performance typically improves at a decreasing rate. Although this learning-curve pattern is found in many industries, organizations vary in the rate at which they learn. In order to understand this variation, we separate organizational learning into four processes: search, knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer. Within each process, we present research on how dimensions of experience and of the organizational context affect learning processes and outcomes. Our goals are to describe major findings and to identify opportunities for future research. The article concludes with a discussion of research directions that are likely to be productive in the future. These directions include investigating how new technological and organizational developments are likely to affect organizational learning.

Organizational forgetting in local governments: a study from rural India

Abstract: Purpose The aim of this paper is to develop a theory of organizational forgetting in the context of local governments from the paradigmatic lens of existing research orchestrated in management literature. The paper empirically explores how and why local governments forget and discusses the role of local politics in promoting memory loss in organizations. Design/methodology/approach The authors do an ethnographic study in a Village Panchayat, the lowest tier of the local government in rural India, in West Bengal, a state in eastern India. Data are collected through participant observation and informal interviews. Findings The paper argues that the existing framework on modes of organizational forgetting developed in the management literature is not sufficient in understanding the types of knowledge loss that occur in local governments. It shows that as a consequence of “memory decay” and “failure to capture,” local governments involuntary lose past knowledge and critical sources of expertise. The study also acknowledges the role of politics in deliberately endorsing organizational forgetting in local governments to eliminate failure and ethical lapses of elected representatives. Originality/value By exploring the phenomenon of organizational forgetting in local governments in the context of grassroots politics, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion of organizational forgetting in a hitherto understudied area of how, and under what circumstances, public organizations such as local governments undergo forgetting, unlearning or loss of knowledge.

Evaluating a recorded appointment service for individual research consultations between librarians and allied health students

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/evaluating-recorded-appointment-service/docview/2607100930/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Purpose Research consultations are a long-established means of providing support to students undertaking research activities (Stapleton et al. , 2020). The literature on research consultations consistently reports high levels of satisfaction and that students value the individual, bespoke advice received via one-on-one librarian tuition. However, research consultations are resource-intensive and maximising the learning potential of consultations is a priority to justify the expenditure of time and ensure the sustainability of services. This study reports on the outcomes of a service development where students attending research consultations were offered a screencast recording of their appointment to support retention and application of information literacy skills and research processes covered in the research consultation. The study explored student use and perceptions of the service and how the recording of the appointment was integrated into research practices. Design/methodology/approach The study used a mixed-method approach including a questionnaire and interviews. Quantitative elements explored if and how students engaged with recordings made during research consultations while qualitative elements investigated students' perceptions of the service and how content from the recordings was used to complete research activities. Findings Findings indicated a high degree of positive feedback on the service and reveal complex user behaviours when using appointment recordings. The study demonstrates that the addition of multimedia recording during individual research consultations (IRCs) may offer significant benefits to students by improving knowledge retention and application and for librarians by reducing follow-up enquiries and increased engagement with the service. Practical implications The findings of this study give an evidential basis for library and reference services interesting in incorporating synchronous recording into a research consultation service. Originality/value This study is believed to be the first to investigate the perceptions and use of synchronous recording of research consultations between librarians and students.

Abstract: The successful implementation of knowledge management (KM) in a company enables the processing, interpretation and use of information about market trends and directions. Orientation in the market using KM may also lead to a competitive advantage and enhance the market position of a company. Knowledge remains one of the main resources creating a company's competitive advantage because it is valuable, rare, and difficult to imitate. The ability to manage knowledge is a core competency of an organization as it facilitates the use of various resources and forms the foundation of a business model for success and profitability. The company must be market-oriented, which means the company should not only create, acquire, share, and use knowledge and avoid knowledge loss, but also do it taking into account the requirements of customers, market opportunities and threats, rival's actions, and so on. Knowledge can enhance the ability of a company to understand the market and to anticipate changes and trends, leading companies to a better market position. To make marketing decisions, the company receives information about customers from the retailers, consumer knowledge from market research, and market knowledge from third parties. Using these three sources, a company may create an appropriate image and take a better market position. This study explores the relationship between knowledge management and market position and provides a framework of interaction between the company and customer to obtain meaningful knowledge. The sample used in the research is made up of companies that achieved higher revenue in 2020 (based on the ranking list of Fortune 500 global corporations). We highlight different approaches from the most profitable companies on how to strengthen market position through knowledge management, especially through customer knowledge.

Abstract: Purpose: Knowledge risks are increasingly becoming a great challenge to a variety of organizations. At the same time, academic research on such types of risks, their consequences, and potential ways of overcoming them is still scarce and fragmented. To fill this gap, the paper aims to find out do companies manage their knowledge risks, what are the possible knowledge risks they face and have they observed an increase of knowledge risks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper is aimed to present insights on different types of knowledge risks that organizations face, and the ways organizations handle them. The paper also proposes some potential countermeasures organizations might use to mitigate the consequences of knowledge risks. Methodology: The study presents the results of a quantitative survey performed among 60 professionals dealing with management and knowledge risks in organizations. In the study, the authors also have examined what tools and methods are used to manage these risks. The study also explores the level of readiness organizations have to address potential knowledge risks. Findings: The theoretical study has allowed us to identify a variety of knowledge risks, which can bear severe consequences for organizations, such as knowledge loss, knowledge leaking, knowledge hiding, or risks related to cybercrime. All these risks may potentially reduce the productivity in organizations, thus leading to the degradation of organizational performance. Research limitations: Research results are limited to the convenience sample that was selected for the study and thus may not give a comprehensive overview of the state of the art. Practical implications: The study provides useful insights for managers and owners of organizations in need of dealing with the knowledge risks in their organizations. The paper is enriched with a number of sample solutions that they may apply for the sake of their organization. Originality/value: The paper lays the ground for a better understanding of the knowledge risks that organizations need to face nowadays. As such, the paper offers food for thought for researchers dealing with the topic of knowledge risks, knowledge management, and organizational risk management in general.

Abstract: We trace the evolution of research on organizational learning. As organizations acquire experience, their performance typically improves at a decreasing rate. Although this learning-curve pattern is found in many industries, organizations vary in the rate at which they learn. In order to understand this variation, we separate organizational learning into four processes: search, knowledge creation, knowledge retention, and knowledge transfer. Within each process, we present research on how dimensions of experience and of the organizational context affect learning processes and outcomes. Our goals are to describe major findings and to identify opportunities for future research. The article concludes with a discussion of research directions that are likely to be productive in the future. These directions include investigating how new technological and organizational developments are likely to affect organizational learning.

Abstract: Based on theories of learning that suggest that repetition is important for knowledge retention and application, this article hypothesized that sending farmers reminders about cereal management information received during face‐to‐face training has impact on the adoption of recommended practices and related agricultural outcomes over and above what could be realized after receiving training alone. We provide a test of this hypothesis using a randomized controlled trial in Sikasso, Mali. Farmers in 99 villages received face‐to‐face training, after which 44 villages received mobile phone voice messages that reinforced the training recommendations. This setup allowed us to evaluate the impact of the voice SMS reminders on selected indicators. Our results show that the reminders significantly induced timely harvesting, reduced on‐farm cereal losses, increased uptake of improved grain storage technology, and increased the likelihood of pre‐harvest sales contracting. However, we found no overwhelming evidence that the reminders increased yields, and no evidence of impact on revenues were detected. We draw lessons for development policy and practice.

Abstract: Objectives The objective of the present study was to investigate to which extent preparatory self‐study can be improved by encouraging students to engage in individual self‐explanations or dyadic explanations (ie in pairs). Individual self‐explanations refer to an act of metacognition in which students, after having processed a certain amount of information, attempt to explain their understanding to themselves of what was just learned. Dyadic explanations refer to the same process, but instead of explaining to oneself, the student explains his/her understanding to another student. Method An experiment was conducted in which 120 medical students studied a video‐recorded lecture on the role of protein synthesis inhibition on memory reconsolidation. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: (1) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture once; (2) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture twice; (3) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide self‐explanations individually; and (4) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide dyadic explanations. Participants’ knowledge regarding the topic was measured three times: at the start and end of the experiment, and one week after the experiment to determine knowledge retention. Data were analysed by means of a 2 × 2 and 4 × 3 repeated‐measures ANOVA. Results The results suggest that participants who engaged in individual self‐ or dyadic explanations significantly outperformed participants in the two control conditions in terms of learning and retention (F = 5.67, Wilks Λ = 0.94, P  = .019, η 2  = 0.05). Moreover, the results suggest that dyadic explanations were more effective than individual self‐explanations (F = 3.70, Wilks Λ = 0.83, P  = .002, η 2  = 0.09). Conclusions These outcomes suggest that encouraging students to work in pairs or in small teams to prepare for a learning event results in superior preparation and learning.

Abstract: Disaster medicine education is an important but often neglected part of Emergency Medicine (EM) specialty trainees' curriculum. It is especially neglected in limited resource environments (1), which, owing to poor infrastructure generally, are more likely to be affected by disasters than better resourced environments. Disaster medicine cannot be taught solely in a classroom and various methods are required to teach practical concepts. This study aims to look at Emergency specialty trainees' perception of high-fidelity simulation and their needs with regards to Disaster Medicine Education. INTRODUCTION Disaster medicine education is an important but often neglected part of Emergency Medicine (EM) specialty trainees' curriculum. It is especially neglected in limited resource environments (1), which, owing to poor infrastructure generally, are more likely to be affected by disasters than better resourced environments. Disaster medicine cannot be taught solely in a classroom and various methods are required to teach practical concepts. This study aims to look at Emergency specialty trainees' perception of high-fidelity simulation and their needs with regards to Disaster Medicine Education.This was a prospective cross-sectional cohort study involving 27 EM specialty trainees from the University of the Witwatersrand, who, participated in a high-fidelity simulation and were given a questionnaire before and after the exercise. The questionnaire consisted of theory questions relating to disaster medicine as well as Emergency Specialty trainee's perception and needs towards disaster medicine education. METHODS This was a prospective cross-sectional cohort study involving 27 EM specialty trainees from the University of the Witwatersrand, who, participated in a high-fidelity simulation and were given a questionnaire before and after the exercise. The questionnaire consisted of theory questions relating to disaster medicine as well as Emergency Specialty trainee's perception and needs towards disaster medicine education.High fidelity simulation does not increase theoretical knowledge of Disaster Medicine but it does increase perceived confidence. EM specialty trainees seek yearly training, beginning in their first year and choose high fidelity simulation as their preferred method of training. RESULTS High fidelity simulation does not increase theoretical knowledge of Disaster Medicine but it does increase perceived confidence. EM specialty trainees seek yearly training, beginning in their first year and choose high fidelity simulation as their preferred method of training.High fidelity simulation is crucial to increasing the confidence of EM specialty trainees during their training. More research is needed to develop core competencies and methods of evaluating training. CONCLUSION High fidelity simulation is crucial to increasing the confidence of EM specialty trainees during their training. More research is needed to develop core competencies and methods of evaluating training.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis (SA) is an important research area in cognitive computation—thus, in-depth studies of patterns of sentiment analysis are necessary. At present, rich-resource data-based SA has been well-developed, while the more challenging and practical multi-source unsupervised SA (i.e., a target-domain SA by transferring from multiple source domains) is seldom studied. The challenges behind this problem mainly locate in the lack of supervision information, the semantic gaps among domains (i.e., domain shifts), and the loss of knowledge. However, existing methods either lack the distinguishable capacity of the semantic gaps among domains or lose private knowledge. To alleviate these problems, we propose a two-stage domain adaptation framework. In the first stage, a multi-task methodology-based shared-private architecture is employed to explicitly model the domain-common features and the domain-specific features for the labeled source domains. In the second stage, two elaborate mechanisms are embedded in the shared-private architecture to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains. The first mechanism is a selective domain adaptation (SDA) method, which transfers knowledge from the closest source domain. And the second mechanism is a target-oriented ensemble (TOE) method, in which knowledge is transferred through a well-designed ensemble method. Extensive experiment evaluations verify that the performance of the proposed framework outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art competitors. What can be concluded from the experiments is that transferring from very different distributed source domains may degrade the target-domain performance, and it is crucial to choose proper source domains to transfer from.

Abstract: The objective of the present study was to investigate to which extent preparatory self-study can be improved by encouraging students to engage in individual self-explanations or dyadic explanations (ie in pairs). Individual self-explanations refer to an act of metacognition in which students, after having processed a certain amount of information, attempt to explain their understanding to themselves of what was just learned. Dyadic explanations refer to the same process, but instead of explaining to oneself, the student explains his/her understanding to another student. OBJECTIVES The objective of the present study was to investigate to which extent preparatory self-study can be improved by encouraging students to engage in individual self-explanations or dyadic explanations (ie in pairs). Individual self-explanations refer to an act of metacognition in which students, after having processed a certain amount of information, attempt to explain their understanding to themselves of what was just learned. Dyadic explanations refer to the same process, but instead of explaining to oneself, the student explains his/her understanding to another student.An experiment was conducted in which 120 medical students studied a video-recorded lecture on the role of protein synthesis inhibition on memory reconsolidation. Participants were randomly allocated to one of four conditions: (1) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture once; (2) a control condition in which they listened to the lecture twice; (3) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide self-explanations individually; and (4) an experimental condition in which they had to listen to the lecture and provide dyadic explanations. Participants' knowledge regarding the topic was measured three times: at the start and end of the experiment, and one week after the experiment to determine knowledge retention. Data were analysed by means of a 2 × 2 and 4 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA.

Data were analysed by means of a 2 × 2 and 4 × 3 repeated-measures ANOVA.The results suggest that participants who engaged in individual self- or dyadic explanations significantly outperformed participants in the two control conditions in terms of learning and retention (F = 5.67, Wilks Λ = 0.94, P = .019, η 2  = 0.05). Moreover, the results suggest that dyadic explanations were more effective than individual self-explanations (F = 3.70, Wilks Λ = 0.83, P = .002, η 2  = 0.09).

CONCLUSIONS These outcomes suggest that encouraging students to work in pairs or in small teams to prepare for a learning event results in superior preparation and learning.

Abstract: The Haitian Annual Assembly of Orthopaedic Trauma (HAAOT) is an annual continuing medical education (CME) conference for Haitian orthopedists and trainees converted to a pilot virtual format in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated this virtual format's effectiveness at teaching, facilitating bilingual discussion, and encouraging cross-cultural exchange of experiences - all aimed at improving orthopedic knowledge in a low-resource country like Haiti. OBJECTIVE The Haitian Annual Assembly of Orthopaedic Trauma (HAAOT) is an annual continuing medical education (CME) conference for Haitian orthopedists and trainees converted to a pilot virtual format in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated this virtual format's effectiveness at teaching, facilitating bilingual discussion, and encouraging cross-cultural exchange of experiences - all aimed at improving orthopedic knowledge in a low-resource country like Haiti.Planned collaboratively between North American and Haitian colleagues, the conference involved 4 bilingual weekly Zoom meetings comprised of 4 to 6 prerecorded presentations and live-translated discussion. Pre- and postmeeting knowledge assessments in French (Haitian language of medical instruction) were administered weekly with results compared via 2-sample t-tests. An online postconference survey evaluated attendee satisfaction with the virtual format. DESIGN Planned collaboratively between North American and Haitian colleagues, the conference involved 4 bilingual weekly Zoom meetings comprised of 4 to 6 prerecorded presentations and live-translated discussion. Pre- and postmeeting knowledge assessments in French (Haitian language of medical instruction) were administered weekly with results compared via 2-sample t-tests. An online postconference survey evaluated attendee satisfaction with the virtual format.Virtual. SETTING Virtual.Weekly attendance involved approximately 50 Haitian orthopedists and trainees, with 20 to 25 completing pre- and postmeeting assessments. PARTICIPANTS Weekly attendance involved approximately 50 Haitian orthopedists and trainees, with 20 to 25 completing pre- and postmeeting assessments.Statistically significant increases between pre/post scores were seen during 3 of 4 sessions. Session-wide significant score increases occurred for residents and attending surgeons with <10 years of experience. 85.7% of attendees reported the virtual platform exceeded expectations and 100% indicated likely or extremely likely participation in further virtual events. RESULTS Statistically significant increases between pre/post scores were seen during 3 of 4 sessions. Session-wide significant score increases occurred for residents and attending surgeons with <10 years of experience. 85.7% of attendees reported the virtual platform exceeded expectations and 100% indicated likely or extremely likely participation in further virtual events.The pilot virtual HAAOT was extremely well received with high desire for future sessions. Beyond short-term knowledge retention among attendees, nonmeasurable benefits included collaboration between orthopedists and trainees in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Haiti, and Burkina Faso. As COVID-19 spurs online learning in high-income nations, the successful low-resource context adjustments and local partnership underlying this model attest that travel restrictions need not impede delivery of virtual CME conferences in lower-income nations. Attendee learning and the decreased cost and travel requirements allude to this platform's sustainability and reproducibility in facilitating future international education and capacity building. Further studies will assess long-term retention of presented material. CONCLUSIONS The pilot virtual HAAOT was extremely well received with high desire for future sessions.

Abstract: In the last few decades, the need to change the curriculum of basic medical science has been further emphasized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of teaching integrated course of physical examination and radiological anatomy in practical limb anatomy on medical students' learning outcomes. BACKGROUND In the last few decades, the need to change the curriculum of basic medical science has been further emphasized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of teaching integrated course of physical examination and radiological anatomy in practical limb anatomy on medical students' learning outcomes.This was an experimental study. Medical students (of the 4th semester of medical education) were divided into intervention and control groups. Related topics of physical examination and radiological anatomy were added to the practical limb anatomy courses of the intervention group. Practical knowledge of anatomy, clinical applications of anatomical knowledge, students 'satisfaction, and students' attitude toward the anatomy course were assessed at the end of the study. Knowledge retention was assessed three months after the semester. METHODS This was an experimental study. Medical students (of the 4th semester of medical education) were divided into intervention and control groups. Related topics of physical examination and radiological anatomy were added to the practical limb anatomy courses of the intervention group. Practical knowledge of anatomy, clinical applications of anatomical knowledge, students 'satisfaction, and students' attitude toward the anatomy course were assessed at the end of the study. Knowledge retention was assessed three months after the semester.The intervention group scored significantly higher mean scores in practical knowledge of anatomy test, clinical applications of anatomical knowledge test and knowledge retention test (P-value < 0.05). In evaluating students' satisfaction with the course, the intervention group was satisfied with the course and teacher performance and had appropriate attitude (Mean˃4, Max score = 5) towards the application of anatomy in medicine. RESULTS The intervention group scored significantly higher mean scores in practical knowledge of anatomy test, clinical applications of anatomical knowledge test and knowledge retention test (P-value < 0.05). In evaluating students' satisfaction with the course, the intervention group was satisfied with the course and teacher performance and had appropriate attitude (Mean˃4, Max score = 5) towards the application of anatomy in medicine.The findings of this study showed that teaching practical anatomy with a clinical integrated approach can improve the practical knowledge of anatomy, knowledge retention, and clinical applications of anatomical knowledge. In addition, an integrated approach was associated with greater student satisfaction and it makes students have appropriate attitude towards the application of anatomy in medicine. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study showed that teaching practical anatomy with a clinical integrated approach can improve the practical knowledge of anatomy, knowledge retention, and clinical applications of anatomical knowledge. In addition, an integrated approach was associated with greater student satisfaction and it makes students have appropriate attitude towards the application of anatomy in medicine.

Abstract: Active learning improves learner engagement and knowledge retention. The application of continuous quality improvement methodologies, such as the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) framework, may be useful for optimizing medical education, including active learning sessions. We aimed to enhance student satisfaction and achievement of learning outcomes by applying the PDSA framework to an antibiotic utilization curriculum for medical students. BACKGROUND Active learning improves learner engagement and knowledge retention. The application of continuous quality improvement methodologies, such as the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) framework, may be useful for optimizing medical education, including active learning sessions. We aimed to enhance student satisfaction and achievement of learning outcomes by applying the PDSA framework to an antibiotic utilization curriculum for medical students.Guided by the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework, between February 2017 and July 2019, we developed, implemented, and revised an active learning session for medical students, focused on appropriate utilization of antibiotics during their Internal Medicine clerkship. METHODS Guided by the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework, between February 2017 and July 2019, we developed, implemented, and revised an active learning session for medical students, focused on appropriate utilization of antibiotics during their Internal Medicine clerkship.Across twelve sessions, 367 students (83.4%) completed the post-evaluation survey. Although baseline ratings were high (97% of respondents enjoyed the "active learning" format), constructive comments informed iterative improvements to the session, such as modifying session timing, handouts and organization of the gaming component. Intervention 3, the last improvement cycle, resulted in more favorable ratings for the active learning format (p = 0.015) improvement in understanding antibiotics and their clinical application (p = 0.001) compared to Baseline ratings. RESULTS Across twelve sessions, 367 students (83.4%) completed the post-evaluation survey. Although baseline ratings were high (97% of respondents enjoyed the "active learning" format), constructive comments informed iterative improvements to the session, such as modifying session timing, handouts and organization of the gaming component. Intervention 3, the last improvement cycle, resulted in more favorable ratings for the active learning format (p = 0.015) improvement in understanding antibiotics and their clinical application (p = 0.001) compared to Baseline ratings.This intervention suggests that active learning, with regular incorporation of student feedback vis-à-vis a PDSA cycle, was effective in achieving high student engagement in an Internal Medicine core clerkship session on antibiotic therapy. Iterative interventions based on student feedback, such as providing an antibiotic reference table and answer choices for each case, further improved student receptivity and perceived educational value. The study findings have potential implications for medical education and suggest that the application of the PDSA cycle can optimize active learning pedagogies and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This intervention suggests that active learning, with regular incorporation of student feedback vis-à-vis a PDSA cycle, was effective in achieving high student engagement in an Internal Medicine core clerkship session on antibiotic therapy.

Abstract: Teaching histology as an image-intensive discipline is a major challenge to medical teachers. We compared knowledge retention and student preference after performing comparison-based and traditional methods of teaching practical histology. BACKGROUND Teaching histology as an image-intensive discipline is a major challenge to medical teachers. We compared knowledge retention and student preference after performing comparison-based and traditional methods of teaching practical histology.We performed a crossover randomized controlled trial. Eighty nine first-year and 37 second-year medical students were randomly assigned to comparison-based or traditional classes in which PowerPoint slides were used. Each teaching approach was then switched to another group for a second tissue set. Quantitative assessment was performed using multiple-choice questions and a questionnaire. METHODS We performed a crossover randomized controlled trial. Eighty nine first-year and 37 second-year medical students were randomly assigned to comparison-based or traditional classes in which PowerPoint slides were used. Each teaching approach was then switched to another group for a second tissue set. Quantitative assessment was performed using multiple-choice questions and a questionnaire.The first-year students' overall examination scores were significantly higher in the comparison-based approach compared to the traditional approach for both tissue sets, with a large effect size. Interestingly, even for the second-year students, a significantly higher overall score for one set of tissue samples was observed in the comparison-based approach compared to the traditional approach. The students' responses to all the elements in the questionnaire were significantly in favor of the comparison-based approach. RESULTS The first-year students' overall examination scores were significantly higher in the comparison-based approach compared to the traditional approach for both tissue sets, with a large effect size. Interestingly, even for the second-year students, a significantly higher overall score for one set of tissue samples was observed in the comparison-based approach compared to the traditional approach. The students' responses to all the elements in the questionnaire were significantly in favor of the comparison-based approach.Our findings indicate that the simple implementation of a few histopathology examples can yield a tremendous improvement in first-year medical students' understanding, enjoyment, and engagement in practical histology classes. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that the simple implementation of a few histopathology examples can yield a tremendous improvement in first-year medical students' understanding, enjoyment, and engagement in practical histology classes.

Abstract: Purpose > Premature departure of highly skilled and experienced soldiers is detrimental to the excellence of a military organisation. The organisation can achieve knowledge superiority over adversaries, only if it acknowledges the organisation’s critical knowledge and undertakes necessary steps to preserve it. The purpose of this paper is to find out the critical types of knowledge loss in military organisations when a soldier departs. Design/methodology/approach > This study uses grounded theory methodology with purposive/theoretical sampling of experts from the Indian Air Force, coding and constant comparative analysis to construct different knowledge categories. ATLAS.ti 8 was used for data coding and analysis. Findings > This paper identifies eight types of knowledge categories in a military organisation and specifies the criticality of each category. Research limitation/implication > This study has been piloted on a single organisation with a limited number of samples. However, the results can be used in future research on exploring generalisation. This study is unique in providing useful insights into the types of critical knowledge loss in a military organisation. Research infuses theoretical rigour to the knowledge management (KM) literature and provides impetus to study various aspects of KM in a military organisation. Practical implication > This study provides the first set of guidelines for the leaders in military organisations to develop a KM strategy for knowledge loss. Research lists specific and actionable areas of knowledge for the commanders to act with considerable savings to exchequer, time and effort. The result could be reasonably generalised for other military setups in the world. Originality/value > This paper is highly innovative and would significantly contribute to the under-explored area of KM in military organisations and the KM literature.

Abstract: Purpose This study aims to assess knowledge retention of the graduates of the online graduate certificate on local development planning, land use management and disaster risk management (PDLOTGR, the abbreviation of the certificate's Spanish title). The certificate was offered to practitioners and faculty members of Latin American countries since 2016. Design/methodology/approach The authors reviewed the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) method to develop a specific approach, which included the preparation of a KAP survey, a composite KAP index and three sub-indices. The survey targeted two groups: (1) experimental group, composed of the certificate's 76 graduates, and (2) control group, comprised of 25 certificate's candidates, who had not yet undergone the training/intervention. The statistical analysis included a one-way multivariate analysis of variance to compare the mean scores on the KAP index and sub-indices for individuals in the experimental and control groups. Findings The study results showed significant differences in the knowledge sub-index between those who had completed the PDLOTGR training and those who had not, while the attitudes and practices sub-indices did not show significant differences. When using the KAP index, a statistically significant difference was also observed between the two groups. Originality/value Perceived knowledge assessment offers an acceptable and non-intimidating option for evaluating continuing education and professional development programs associated to disaster risk. It is particularly helpful in determining whether an intervention or program has a lasting impact. It is not, however, a substitute for direct knowledge assessment, and the use of other methods to evaluate the performance of a capacity building program's graduates.

Abstract: The use and knowledge of medicinal plants play an essential role in community health in rural Mexico. Medicinal plants are part of the local heritage and provide a source of economic income. Nevertheless, knowledge of their use has declined due to factors like accelerated urbanization. Some authors have proposed that by reducing natural spaces, urbanization generates changes that impact the recognition, use, and management of natural resources. Here, we evaluate how urbanization affects the knowledge, use, and perception of medicinal plants in a Biosphere Reserve in Mexico. BACKGROUND The use and knowledge of medicinal plants play an essential role in community health in rural Mexico. Medicinal plants are part of the local heritage and provide a source of economic income. Nevertheless, knowledge of their use has declined due to factors like accelerated urbanization. Some authors have proposed that by reducing natural spaces, urbanization generates changes that impact the recognition, use, and management of natural resources. Here, we evaluate how urbanization affects the knowledge, use, and perception of medicinal plants in a Biosphere Reserve in Mexico.Using a mixed methodology including quantitative and qualitative analyses, we generated a list of medicinal plants, methods of preparation, prevalence of illness, and use in two communities with different degrees of urbanization. METHODS Using a mixed methodology including quantitative and qualitative analyses, we generated a list of medicinal plants, methods of preparation, prevalence of illness, and use in two communities with different degrees of urbanization.A total of 217 medicinal plants were identified. The more urbanized community had greater knowledge of, and used, a larger number of introduced plant species, while the less urbanized community used and had more knowledge about wild plants. One of the factors explaining these differences was occupation, with people who work outdoors showing greater knowledge of wild plants. RESULTS A total of 217 medicinal plants were identified. The more urbanized community had greater knowledge of, and used, a larger number of introduced plant species, while the less urbanized community used and had more knowledge about wild plants. One of the factors explaining these differences was occupation, with people who work outdoors showing greater knowledge of wild plants.Urbanization can lead to a loss of knowledge of the use and management of local wild species, with implications for the conservation of biocultural heritage. Substitution of native medicinal plants by introduced species shows disinterest and disuse in the local medicinal flora, which could be reflected in their ecosystems. CONCLUSIONS Urbanization can lead to a loss of knowledge of the use and management of local wild species, with implications for the conservation of biocultural heritage. Substitution of native medicinal plants by introduced species shows disinterest and disuse in the local medicinal flora, which could be reflected in their ecosystems.

Abstract: It was recently shown that novice medical students could be trained to demonstrate the speed-to-diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy typical of System-1-type reasoning. However, the effectiveness of this training can only be fully evaluated when considering the extent to which knowledge transfer and long-term retention occur as a result, the former of which is known to be notoriously difficult to achieve. This study aimed to investigate whether knowledge learned during an online training exercise for chest X-ray diagnosis promoted either knowledge transfer or retention, or both. Second year medical students were presented with, and trained to recognise the features of four chest X-ray conditions. Subsequently, they were shown the four trained-for cases again as well as different representations of the same conditions varying in the number of common elements and asked to provide a diagnosis, to test for near-transfer (four cases) and far-transfer (four cases) of knowledge. They were also shown four completely new conditions to diagnose. Two weeks later they were asked to diagnose the 16 aforementioned cases again to assess for knowledge retention. Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy and time-to-diagnosis. Thirty-six students volunteered. Trained-for cases were diagnosed most accurately and with most speed (mean score = 3.75/4, mean time = 4.95 s). When assessing knowledge transfer, participants were able to diagnose near-transfer cases more accurately (mean score = 2.08/4, mean time = 15.77 s) than far-transfer cases (mean score = 1.31/4, mean time = 18.80 s), which showed similar results to those conditions previously unseen (mean score = 0.72/4, mean time = 19.46 s). Retention tests showed a similar pattern but accuracy scores were lower overall. This study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully promote knowledge transfer and retention in Year 2 medical students, using an online training exercise involving diagnosis of chest X-rays, and is one of the few studies to provide evidence of actual knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Kentucky experiences the highest overall cancer incidence and mortality rates in the USA with the greatest burden in the eastern, Appalachian region of the state. Cancer disparities in Kentucky are driven in part by poor health behaviors, poverty, lack of health care access, low education levels, and low health literacy. Individuals with inadequate health literacy are less likely to participate in preventive measures such as obtaining screenings and making healthy lifestyle choices, thus increasing their chances of developing and dying from cancer. By increasing cancer literacy among youth and adults, it may be possible to decrease cancer disparities across Kentucky. This study aimed to establish connections with middle and high schools in Kentucky that would facilitate pilot implementation of a brief cancer education intervention and assessment of cancer health literacy among these student populations. A baseline pretest cancer literacy survey consisting of 10 items was given to 349 participants, followed by the delivery of a cancer education presentation. Immediately following the presentation, participants were given a posttest with identical items to the pretest. Participants were primarily Caucasian (89.4%), female (68.7%), and in 10th through 12th grade (80.5%). Significant ( p < 0.0001) increases in both average and median percent of correctly marked items were observed between the pretest and posttest (average, pretest = 56% versus posttest = 85%; median, pretest = 60% versus posttest = 90%). The scores for all individual items increased after the brief intervention. The results demonstrated a significant increase in cancer literacy levels immediately after the pilot educational intervention. We suggest that it may be possible to improve cancer literacy rates in Kentucky by integrating cancer education into middle and high school science and/or health education curricula. This could ultimately drive changes in behaviors that may help lower cancer incidence and mortality rates. Plans for future interventional studies measuring long-term cancer knowledge retention and resultant behavioral changes among middle and high school students as well as the feasibility of integrating cancer education into middle and high school curricula are also discussed.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Soemarwoto R, Iskandar J. 2021. Plant knowledge richness in the Sundanese upland village: A case study in Sindangsari, West Java, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 3722-3735. According to ecological history, Sundanese people of West Java, Indonesia, have highly rich knowledge of plants. However, due to population increase, rapid development of market economy, and rapid change of rural ecosystem, the local plants knowledge has tended to decrease rapidly. This research’s objective is to elucidate the plant knowledge richness of the Sundanese. The study was undertaken in the upland village of Sindangsari, West Java, using mixed-method with ethnobotanical approach, from July to August 2017, and March 2018. The study found 204 landraces which consisted of 181 species, representing 161 genera, and 70 families. The use of plants could be classified into food, spices, medicine, construction, ornament, cosmetic, commercial plants, fodder, industry, food color, erosion control, and social function. The highest secondary citations, that is plants for food and medicine, were known by less than 50% of respondents; other plants were hardly known, recognized only by 0.1% to 0.5% of respondents. The results showed little practical knowledge among the younger generation. The intensive mobility of young population between the village and the city induces intergenerational transfer of knowledge between old and young generations mainly through oral narratives. This study concludes that it is important to consider population mobility of the young generation to predict knowledge loss.

Abstract: Individuals’ knowledge activity is essential for knowledge circulation in organizations. To examine the relationship between knowledge-based psychological ownership and knowledge hiding, we conducted a three-wave online survey with 310 knowledge workers in China. We used the bootstrapping method for mediation effects analysis and found that loss of knowledge power mediated the effect of knowledge-based psychological ownership on knowledge hiding. The results of a conditional process analysis further indicate that emotional intelligence attenuated the indirect impact of knowledge-based psychological ownership on knowledge hiding through the mediator of loss of knowledge power. Our findings enhance understanding of why workers refuse to share their knowledge, and how to decrease knowledge-hiding behaviors in organizations by developing employees’ emotional competency.

Abstract: This study modifies a popular business simulation game, Monopoly, to assess its effectiveness as a learning and teaching tool for helping high school accounting students acquire and apply foundational accounting concepts. The study compares an accounting-focused, Modified Monopoly simulation game with two other instructional methods. Using a quasi-experimental approach that involves three learning groups with random assignment of treatments based on school/class, a sample of 144 accounting students was obtained. This study found students using Modified Monopoly showed significantly greater improvement between their pre- and post-test scores than students in Computer-assisted instruction (CAI), but significantly less improvement than a paper-based extended accounting problem (EAP). However, students using Modified Monopoly, similar to CAI students, did not suffer the same significant decay in knowledge as students in EAP. These results offer evidence for the significant and more enduring learning benefits that Modified Monopoly can produce in students' higher-order thinking skills.

Abstract: The letter presents a study on the efficiency and effectiveness of geriatric drug infographics. Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), authors sought to develop geriatric drug infographics (GDIs) and evaluate their potential to improve clinician pharmacotherapy learning to mitigate ADEs in older, medically complex, and frail adults. This is the first study describing the development and evaluation of infographics to facilitate clinician learning about pharmacotherapy for older adults. Combining text and graphic depictions of information stems from dual-coding and cognitive load theories and improve knowledge retention.9,10 GDIs enhanced retrieval and retention of clinically relevant prescribing information compared to usual resources; however, the time required varied considerably, and may reflect the unfamiliarity with the novel infographics’ iconography, or the possibility of insufficient study power. With repeated use or explanatory aides (e.g., legend), the time required may decrease. Limitations include using clinical scenarios with multiple choice and very short answer questions rather than observing actual clinical practice due to feasibility. We were also unable to detect or prevent contamination between groups. Although we developed the GDIs and set the knowledge tests, they reflected real-world clinical questions, and were validated by external clinicians from multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Introduction Adolescents and young people comprise a growing proportion of new HIV infections globally, yet current approaches do not effectively engage this group, and adolescent HIV‐related outcomes are the poorest among all age groups. Providing psychosocial interventions incorporating psychological, social, and/or behavioural approaches offer a potential pathway to improve engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes among adolescents and young people living with HIV (AYPLHIV). Methods A systematic search of all peer‐reviewed papers published between January 2000 and July 2020 was conducted through four electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus). We included randomized controlled trials evaluating psychosocial interventions aimed at improving engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes of AYPLHIV aged 10 to 24 years. Results and discussion Thirty relevant studies were identified. Studies took place in the United States (n = 18, 60%), sub‐Saharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe) and Southeast Asia (Thailand). Outcomes of interest included adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART knowledge, viral load data, sexual risk behaviours, sexual risk knowledge, retention in care and linkage to care. Overall, psychosocial interventions for AYPLHIV showed important, small‐to‐moderate effects on adherence to ART (SMD = 0.3907, 95% CI: 0.1059 to 0.6754, 21 studies, n = 2647) and viral load (SMD = −0.2607, 95% CI −04518 to −0.0696, 12 studies, n = 1566). The psychosocial interventions reviewed did not demonstrate significant impacts on retention in care (n = 8), sexual risk behaviours and knowledge (n = 13), viral suppression (n = 4), undetectable viral load (n = 5) or linkage to care (n = 1) among AYPLHIV. No studies measured transition to adult services. Effective interventions employed various approaches, including digital and lay health worker delivery, which hold promise for scaling interventions in the context of COVID‐19. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of psychosocial interventions in improving health outcomes in AYPLHIV. However, more research needs to be conducted on interventions that can effectively reduce sexual risk behaviours of AYPLHIV, as well as those that can strengthen engagement in care. Further investment is needed to ensure that these interventions are cost‐effective, sustainable and resilient in the face of resource constraints and global challenges such as the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Abstract: A pediatric and adolescent gynecology curriculum was implemented for obstetrics/gynecology residents at a single institution in Hawai'i. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) formal curriculum in improving knowledge. Twelve residents at the University of Hawai'i completed the curriculum during their second year of training. Of these, 6 residents completed an examination assessing knowledge both before and immediately after the curriculum. Five of these residents completed the examination 1-2 years after completing the curriculum. Average pre-rotation examination scores were 57%, which increased significantly immediately after the curriculum to 87% ( P =.003) and remained significantly higher after 1-2 years with average scores of 71% ( P =.025). A secondary objective was to assess resident comfort and confidence levels in the subject. All residents who completed the curriculum completed surveys assessing comfort in their pediatric and adolescent gynecology training and both perceived confidence and competence in this area. Despite completing the curriculum, 7 of 12 (58%) did not feel comfortable evaluating pediatric gynecology patients, and 5 of 12 (42%) did not feel prepared nor competent to care for pediatric and adolescent patients. A formal pediatric and adolescent gynecology curriculum increased examination performance, which suggests knowledge retention. However, despite curriculum completion, residents still desired more training in the subject area. Residency programs should consider innovative ways to incorporate inpatient and outpatient educational experiences, periodic testing, and feedback longitudinally throughout residency training to improve long-term retention, confidence, and competence in providing gynecologic care in the pediatric and adolescent gynecology population.A pediatric and adolescent gynecology curriculum was implemented for obstetrics/gynecology residents at a single institution in Hawai'i.

Abstract: It was recently shown that novice medical students could be trained to demonstrate the speed-to-diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy typical of System-1-type reasoning. However, the effectiveness of this training can only be fully evaluated when considering the extent to which knowledge transfer and long-term retention occur as a result, the former of which is known to be notoriously difficult to achieve. This study aimed to investigate whether knowledge learned during an online training exercise for chest X-ray diagnosis promoted either knowledge transfer or retention, or both. Second year medical students were presented with, and trained to recognise the features of four chest X-ray conditions. Subsequently, they were shown the four trained-for cases again as well as different representations of the same conditions varying in the number of common elements and asked to provide a diagnosis, to test for near-transfer (four cases) and far-transfer (four cases) of knowledge. They were also shown four completely new conditions to diagnose. Two weeks later they were asked to diagnose the 16 aforementioned cases again to assess for knowledge retention. Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy and time-to-diagnosis. Thirty-six students volunteered. Trained-for cases were diagnosed most accurately and with most speed (mean score = 3.75/4, mean time = 4.95 s). When assessing knowledge transfer, participants were able to diagnose near-transfer cases more accurately (mean score = 2.08/4, mean time = 15.77 s) than far-transfer cases (mean score = 1.31/4, mean time = 18.80 s), which showed similar results to those conditions previously unseen (mean score = 0.72/4, mean time = 19.46 s). Retention tests showed a similar pattern but accuracy scores were lower overall. This study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully promote knowledge transfer and retention in Year 2 medical students, using an online training exercise involving diagnosis of chest X-rays, and is one of the few studies to provide evidence of actual knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Adolescents and young people comprise a growing proportion of new HIV infections globally, yet current approaches do not effectively engage this group, and adolescent HIV-related outcomes are the poorest among all age groups. Providing psychosocial interventions incorporating psychological, social, and/or behavioural approaches offer a potential pathway to improve engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes among adolescents and young people living with HIV (AYPLHIV). INTRODUCTION Adolescents and young people comprise a growing proportion of new HIV infections globally, yet current approaches do not effectively engage this group, and adolescent HIV-related outcomes are the poorest among all age groups. Providing psychosocial interventions incorporating psychological, social, and/or behavioural approaches offer a potential pathway to improve engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes among adolescents and young people living with HIV (AYPLHIV).A systematic search of all peer-reviewed papers published between January 2000 and July 2020 was conducted through four electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus). We included randomized controlled trials evaluating psychosocial interventions aimed at improving engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes of AYPLHIV aged 10 to 24 years. METHODS A systematic search of all peer-reviewed papers published between January 2000 and July 2020 was conducted through four electronic databases (Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus). We included randomized controlled trials evaluating psychosocial interventions aimed at improving engagement in care and health and behavioural outcomes of AYPLHIV aged 10 to 24 years.Thirty relevant studies were identified. Studies took place in the United States (n = 18, 60%), sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe) and Southeast Asia (Thailand). Outcomes of interest included adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART knowledge, viral load data, sexual risk behaviours, sexual risk knowledge, retention in care and linkage to care. Overall, psychosocial interventions for AYPLHIV showed important, small-to-moderate effects on adherence to ART (SMD = 0.3907, 95% CI: 0.1059 to 0.6754, 21 studies, n = 2647) and viral load (SMD = -0.2607, 95% CI -04518 to -0.0696, 12 studies, n = 1566). The psychosocial interventions reviewed did not demonstrate significant impacts on retention in care (n = 8), sexual risk behaviours and knowledge (n = 13), viral suppression (n = 4), undetectable viral load (n = 5) or linkage to care (n = 1) among AYPLHIV. No studies measured transition to adult services. Effective interventions employed various approaches, including digital and lay health worker delivery, which hold promise for scaling interventions in the context of COVID-19. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Thirty relevant studies were identified. Studies took place in the United States (n = 18, 60%), sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe) and Southeast Asia (Thailand). Outcomes of interest included adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART knowledge, viral load data, sexual risk behaviours, sexual risk knowledge, retention in care and linkage to care. Overall, psychosocial interventions for AYPLHIV showed important, small-to-moderate effects on adherence to ART (SMD = 0.3907, 95% CI: 0.1059 to 0.6754, 21 studies, n = 2647) and viral load (SMD = -0.2607, 95% CI -04518 to -0.0696, 12 studies, n = 1566). The psychosocial interventions reviewed did not demonstrate significant impacts on retention in care (n = 8), sexual risk behaviours and knowledge (n = 13), viral suppression (n = 4), undetectable viral load (n = 5) or linkage to care (n = 1) among AYPLHIV. No studies measured transition to adult services. Effective interventions employed various approaches, including digital and lay health worker delivery, which hold promise for scaling interventions in the context of COVID-19.This review highlights the potential of psychosocial interventions in improving health outcomes in AYPLHIV. However, more research needs to be conducted on interventions that can effectively reduce sexual risk behaviours of AYPLHIV, as well as those that can strengthen engagement in care. Further investment is needed to ensure that these interventions are cost-effective, sustainable and resilient in the face of resource constraints and global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS This review highlights the potential of psychosocial interventions in improving health outcomes in AYPLHIV.

Further investment is needed to ensure that these interventions are cost-effective, sustainable and resilient in the face of resource constraints and global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Kentucky experiences the highest overall cancer incidence and mortality rates in the USA with the greatest burden in the eastern, Appalachian region of the state. Cancer disparities in Kentucky are driven in part by poor health behaviors, poverty, lack of health care access, low education levels, and low health literacy. Individuals with inadequate health literacy are less likely to participate in preventive measures such as obtaining screenings and making healthy lifestyle choices, thus increasing their chances of developing and dying from cancer. By increasing cancer literacy among youth and adults, it may be possible to decrease cancer disparities across Kentucky. This study aimed to establish connections with middle and high schools in Kentucky that would facilitate pilot implementation of a brief cancer education intervention and assessment of cancer health literacy among these student populations. A baseline pretest cancer literacy survey consisting of 10 items was given to 349 participants, followed by the delivery of a cancer education presentation. Immediately following the presentation, participants were given a posttest with identical items to the pretest. Participants were primarily Caucasian (89.4%), female (68.7%), and in 10th through 12th grade (80.5%). Significant ( p  < 0.0001) increases in both average and median percent of correctly marked items were observed between the pretest and posttest (average, pretest = 56% versus posttest = 85%; median, pretest = 60% versus posttest = 90%). The scores for all individual items increased after the brief intervention. The results demonstrated a significant increase in cancer literacy levels immediately after the pilot educational intervention. We suggest that it may be possible to improve cancer literacy rates in Kentucky by integrating cancer education into middle and high school science and/or health education curricula. This could ultimately drive changes in behaviors that may help lower cancer incidence and mortality rates. Plans for future interventional studies measuring long-term cancer knowledge retention and resultant behavioral changes among middle and high school students as well as the feasibility of integrating cancer education into middle and high school curricula are also discussed.

Abstract: To describe the design of an application-based calculations review module, determine retention of skills learned in a calculations course, determine student ability to identify information necessary to solve calculations, and evaluate student perceptions. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE To describe the design of an application-based calculations review module, determine retention of skills learned in a calculations course, determine student ability to identify information necessary to solve calculations, and evaluate student perceptions.Three student cohorts completed the calculations application-based review module. All students passed a required pharmaceutical calculations course previously (17 months prior for Cohort 1 and nine months prior for Cohorts 2 and 3). The activity included seven themed stations each with three questions. Each question was categorized by calculation type. Students utilized stock bottles and patient chart information to solve problems. For select stations, necessary information was missing, and students had to request it. Each student completed an activity evaluation form. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING Three student cohorts completed the calculations application-based review module. All students passed a required pharmaceutical calculations course previously (17 months prior for Cohort 1 and nine months prior for Cohorts 2 and 3). The activity included seven themed stations each with three questions. Each question was categorized by calculation type. Students utilized stock bottles and patient chart information to solve problems. For select stations, necessary information was missing, and students had to request it. Each student completed an activity evaluation form.Two hundred ninety students completed the module (90, 102, and 98 in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Two hundred eighty students (97%) completed the activity assessment form. The overall average score was 85.1%, which did not differ significantly among the cohorts. Cohort 1 performed significantly lower on dosage, unit conversion, ratio, and milliosmole calculations. Almost all (96.4%) students agreed the activity reinforced lecture material, and 90% agreed the activity improved their ability to perform in future pharmacy practice. Participating students scored significantly higher on a pre-graduation math skills assessment.

Participating students scored significantly higher on a pre-graduation math skills assessment.Some calculation types, such as dosage, unit conversion, ratio, and milliosmoles may warrant more closely spaced reinforcement activities in the curriculum. Inclusion of the review module was associated with increased knowledge retention. SUMMARY Some calculation types, such as dosage, unit conversion, ratio, and milliosmoles may warrant more closely spaced reinforcement activities in the curriculum. Inclusion of the review module was associated with increased knowledge retention.

Abstract: The migration of software is an economically important niche since the daily operations of many business still rely on systems based on legacy technologies. Migration to more recent technologies comes with major technical and management challenges mainly related to knowledge‐loss issues on the specific technology but also on the architecture and design of the legacy. This article presents a method that addresses the reverse/forward engineering tasks as well as some management challenges such as the planning of the migration based on a better understanding of the system. The process relies on the use of models and transformations to create high‐level abstraction views of the legacy. A big challenge with the migration of certain legacy applications is that much of the business logic is inside triggers which are written in the PL/SQL language and scattered across the application layers. Therefore, developers need to know what they need to migrate and where it is. The main contribution of our work is that the abstractions allow developers to understand and plan the migration without the need of having a vast knowledge on the initial technology. Furthermore, our views help developers to decide about the structure and business logic they want to have in the target system. In this article, we describe the application of the method to the Oracle Forms case study. Nevertheless, the approach can be generalized to other technologies through new bridges that transform from said technologies to the abstract views. The article ends by reporting lessons learned from our experience.

Abstract: The term 'infographics' is a blend of the two words "information" and "graphics". Infographics can be described as 'information visualizations', conceived as visual translation of data including text, numbers, graphs, charts, drawings and so on. Visual representations are a fundamental part of scientific communication. They match the need to organize different pieces of information in a coherent and synthetic structure and constitute one of the most effective methods scientists rely on to divulge their findings. In particular, infographics provide an overview of key points regarding specific topics in a form that promotes quick learning and knowledge retention. They can be presented in printed or digital formats, being the latter particularly suitable for a global-scale diffusion via social media or websites.The term 'infographics' is a blend of the two words "information" and "graphics".

Abstract: It was recently shown that novice medical students could be trained to demonstrate the speed-to-diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy typical of System-1-type reasoning. However, the effectiveness of this training can only be fully evaluated when considering the extent to which knowledge transfer and long-term retention occur as a result, the former of which is known to be notoriously difficult to achieve. This study aimed to investigate whether knowledge learned during an online training exercise for chest X-ray diagnosis promoted either knowledge transfer or retention, or both. Second year medical students were presented with, and trained to recognise the features of four chest X-ray conditions. Subsequently, they were shown the four trained-for cases again as well as different representations of the same conditions varying in the number of common elements and asked to provide a diagnosis, to test for near-transfer (four cases) and far-transfer (four cases) of knowledge. They were also shown four completely new conditions to diagnose. Two weeks later they were asked to diagnose the 16 aforementioned cases again to assess for knowledge retention. Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy and time-to-diagnosis. Thirty-six students volunteered. Trained-for cases were diagnosed most accurately and with most speed (mean score = 3.75/4, mean time = 4.95 s). When assessing knowledge transfer, participants were able to diagnose near-transfer cases more accurately (mean score = 2.08/4, mean time = 15.77 s) than far-transfer cases (mean score = 1.31/4, mean time = 18.80 s), which showed similar results to those conditions previously unseen (mean score = 0.72/4, mean time = 19.46 s). Retention tests showed a similar pattern but accuracy scores were lower overall. This study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully promote knowledge transfer and retention in Year 2 medical students, using an online training exercise involving diagnosis of chest X-rays, and is one of the few studies to provide evidence of actual knowledge transfer.It was recently shown that novice medical students could be trained to demonstrate the speed-to-diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy typical of System-1-type reasoning.

Abstract: Kentucky experiences the highest overall cancer incidence and mortality rates in the USA with the greatest burden in the eastern, Appalachian region of the state. Cancer disparities in Kentucky are driven in part by poor health behaviors, poverty, lack of health care access, low education levels, and low health literacy. Individuals with inadequate health literacy are less likely to participate in preventive measures such as obtaining screenings and making healthy lifestyle choices, thus increasing their chances of developing and dying from cancer. By increasing cancer literacy among youth and adults, it may be possible to decrease cancer disparities across Kentucky. This study aimed to establish connections with middle and high schools in Kentucky that would facilitate pilot implementation of a brief cancer education intervention and assessment of cancer health literacy among these student populations. A baseline pretest cancer literacy survey consisting of 10 items was given to 349 participants, followed by the delivery of a cancer education presentation. Immediately following the presentation, participants were given a posttest with identical items to the pretest. Participants were primarily Caucasian (89.4%), female (68.7%), and in 10th through 12th grade (80.5%). Significant (p < 0.0001) increases in both average and median percent of correctly marked items were observed between the pretest and posttest (average, pretest = 56% versus posttest = 85%; median, pretest = 60% versus posttest = 90%). The scores for all individual items increased after the brief intervention. The results demonstrated a significant increase in cancer literacy levels immediately after the pilot educational intervention. We suggest that it may be possible to improve cancer literacy rates in Kentucky by integrating cancer education into middle and high school science and/or health education curricula. This could ultimately drive changes in behaviors that may help lower cancer incidence and mortality rates. Plans for future interventional studies measuring long-term cancer knowledge retention and resultant behavioral changes among middle and high school students as well as the feasibility of integrating cancer education into middle and high school curricula are also discussed.Kentucky experiences the highest overall cancer incidence and mortality rates in the USA with the greatest burden in the eastern, Appalachian region of the state.

Abstract: Medical resident reading and information-seeking behavior is limited by time constraints as well as comfort in accessing and assessing evidence-based resources. Educational technology interventions, as the preferred method for millennial leaners, can reduce these barriers. We implemented an educational web tool, consisting of peer-reviewed articles as well as local and national protocols and policies, built into the daily workflow of a university-based anesthesiology department. We hypothesized that this web tool would increase resource utilization and overall perceptions of the educational environment. BACKGROUND Medical resident reading and information-seeking behavior is limited by time constraints as well as comfort in accessing and assessing evidence-based resources. Educational technology interventions, as the preferred method for millennial leaners, can reduce these barriers. We implemented an educational web tool, consisting of peer-reviewed articles as well as local and national protocols and policies, built into the daily workflow of a university-based anesthesiology department. We hypothesized that this web tool would increase resource utilization and overall perceptions of the educational environment.The goal of this study was to demonstrate that an educational web tool designed and built into the daily workflow of an academic anesthesia department for trainees could significantly decrease barriers to resource utilization, improve faculty-trainee teaching interactions, and improve the perceptions of the educational environment. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to demonstrate that an educational web tool designed and built into the daily workflow of an academic anesthesia department for trainees could significantly decrease barriers to resource utilization, improve faculty-trainee teaching interactions, and improve the perceptions of the educational environment.Following Institutional Review Board approval, a longitudinal cohort survey study was conducted to assess trainee resource utilization, faculty evaluation of trainees' resource utilization, and trainee and faculty perceptions about the educational environment. The survey study was conducted in a pre-post fashion 3 months prior to web tool implementation and 3 months following implementation. Data were deidentified and analyzed unpaired using Student t tests for continuous data and chi-square tests for ordinal data. METHODS Following Institutional Review Board approval, a longitudinal cohort survey study was conducted to assess trainee resource utilization, faculty evaluation of trainees' resource utilization, and trainee and faculty perceptions about the educational environment. The survey study was conducted in a pre-post fashion 3 months prior to web tool implementation and 3 months following implementation. Data were deidentified and analyzed unpaired using Student t tests for continuous data and chi-square tests for ordinal data.Survey response rates were greater than 50% in all groups: of the 43 trainees, we obtained 27 (63%) preimplementation surveys and 22 (51%) postimplementation surveys; of the 46 faculty members, we obtained 25 (54%) preimplementation surveys and 23 (50%) postimplementation surveys. Trainees showed a significant improvement in utilization of peer-reviewed articles (preimplementation mean 8.67, SD 6.45; postimplementation mean 18.27, SD 12.23; P=.02), national guidelines (preimplementation mean 2.3, SD 2.40; postimplementation mean 6.14, SD 5.01; P<.001), and local policies and protocols (preimplementation mean 2.23, SD 2.72; postimplementation mean 6.95, SD 6.09; P=.02). There was significant improvement in faculty-trainee educational interactions (preimplementation mean 1.67, SD 1.33; postimplementation mean 6.05, SD 8.74; P=.01). Faculty assessment of trainee resource utilization also demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all resource categories. Subgroups among trainees and faculty showed similar trends toward improvement.

Subgroups among trainees and faculty showed similar trends toward improvement.Learning technology interventions significantly decrease the barriers to resource utilization, particularly among millennial learners. Further investigation has been undertaken to assess how this may impact learning, knowledge retention, and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Objective : This study compared learning and skill transfer among university aviation students using interactive Augmented Reality (AR) technology versus traditional paper-based instruction. While similar AR use and research in university education exists, this study piloted a comparative method assessing knowledge retention and transfer. Background : AR technology is a popular tool used in technical education. But learner behaviors observed like game play and exploration during this study could impact future learning strategy design as AR use increases. Method : 36 university undergraduate students enrolled in a university aeronautical engineering technology program were divided into AR and paper-based groups and compared on first-time task execution times for starting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing times for task completion was used. Results : Learner task times using AR were consistently faster, replicating similar AR studies, compared to learners using paper-based. However, AR test subjects also took longer interacting with the technology, including gaming-style “play” and exploration of the digital twin AR flight deck environment. This is believed to enhance learner innovation, knowledge retention and transfer, warranting further study. Conclusion : AR users had significantly reduced task execution times. Pre-task “gamification and play” were also observed among the AR users, which could impact how educators and the industry assess and leverage learning strategies when using AR for job task training.

Abstract: Background: Unlike passive didactic teaching, the introduction of innovative active-learning approaches to university nursing curricula aims to address the educational content in an interactive learning environment, improving in turn the learning process and problem-solving skills indispensable for future infection control professionals. One such strategy is the use of educational games, which can motivate students and enhance the degree of their engagement. We appraised the effectiveness of introducing an interactive game based on a popular television quiz show “Who Wants to be a Millionaire?” for educational attainment, exam performance, and course perception in nursing students. Methods: A whole generation of second-year undergraduate nursing students (126 female and 27 male participants; age range, 19–41 years) from a public university in Croatia (University Centre Varazdin, University North) were divided into 2 groups by cluster randomization; one group had received additional hours of game play after core training curriculum in a “Hygiene and Epidemiology” course, while the other had not. Game play was accomplished by employing ‘edutaining’ interactive multimedia approach, and covered primarily hand hygiene, cough etiquette, the use of personal protective equipment, sterilization and disinfection, and safe injection practices. Quantitative results of multiple-choice exams were used to evaluate any differences in the knowledge level of respective groups. A satisfaction opinion survey was used to gauge attitudes of students attending the course. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05 (2-tailed). Results: The mean baseline examination score was 28.30±5.79 points for the game group and 24.65±5.94 points for the control group, demonstrating improved knowledge retention when the interactive game was introduced into the curriculum. The statistically significant improvement in knowledge was observed in the domains of personal protective equipment and safe injection practices. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall scores between male and female students. Students who were subjected to game play expressed more agreement on a Likert scale regarding course enjoyment and innovativeness, albeit they did not differ from control group when assessing the educational merit of the course. Conclusions: Introducing interactive games to university courses that cover infection control may boost student enjoyment and enhance long-term retention of information, as confirmed by this study. Nonetheless, extra care should be taken when specific games that have not been assessed objectively are implemented. Further research in this field will elucidate how this increased knowledge retention in infection control principles translates to quotidian practice, for the benefit of students and (ultimately) patients.

Abstract: Background: The Walking Classroom is an education program that provides students with an opportunity to accumulate physical activity without losing instructional time. Method: This research tests Kuczala’s application of kinesthetic learning theory through measuring knowledge retention, postactivity information processing, and mood in students who engage in a short bout of physical activity while listening to Walking Classroom podcasts about language arts, science, and history, and those who remain seated during a podcast, compared with baseline levels. Students from 9 high-poverty fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms (n = 319) in a North Carolina county comprised the sample. Results: Utilizing multivariate analysis of covariance, the results demonstrate significantly higher levels of learning while walking compared with learning while sitting. Measures of mood utilizing the 10-item version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale also demonstrated a significant effect in predicted directions. Conclusion: The results support that coupling physical activity with instruction leads to increased performance and mood for elementary school students.

Abstract: Medication review is an important service in optimising medicine use and improves clinical outcomes. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of pharmacist-led medication review on patients' knowledge and adherence. For this prospective study, 480 patients were randomly recruited in six primary healthcare clinics in Petaling District Health Office. Patients were interviewed with a questionnaire and validated medication adherence scale during recruitment and at follow-up visit to assess their medication knowledge and adherence. The data was analysed using Chi-square tests and paired t-tests to determine the correlation between medication knowledge and adherence with patient demographics. Among 408 patients that had completed the follow-up, 16.9% of patients showed medication knowledge deficits on recruitment. However, there is a significant improvement in the medication knowledge indices during the follow-up session (p < 0.001). Elderly patients were found to benefit from medication review with better medication knowledge and adherence post-medication review. The study found that the number of good adherers increased by 29.3% after the medication review. A further study demonstrating the effectiveness of medication review in cultivating knowledge retention and sustained adherence in the longer-term is warranted. Future work shall also focus on measuring the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-led medication review implementation in primary healthcare settings. Pharmacist-led medication review is an essential and effective service in primary health care facilities for patients to enhance their knowledge on their medications, and adherence especially in elderly patients on chronic medications.

Abstract: This paper reports on a study on the effects of reading-writing integrated tasks on vocabulary learning and explored the differential roles of creative construction and non-creative construction in promoting lexical learning. Participants were 90 first-year English majors, randomly assigned to two experimental groups (continuation and retelling) and one control group, with 30 students in each group. Results showed that the continuation group generated a substantial amount of creative construction and produced significantly more instances of creative imitation than the retelling group. The continuation group outperformed the retelling group for both receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge gain and retention, but differences were only significant in terms of productive vocabulary retention. Finally, productive vocabulary knowledge retention among the continuation group was significantly and positively correlated with creative imitation (meaning creation coupled with language imitation), but not with linguistic alignment per se. As productive vocabulary knowledge constitutes the learner ’ s ability to use lexical knowledge to express ideas in dynamic contexts, the findings afforded evidence that creative imitation could be the answer to the fundamental issue of L2 learning (i.e., mapping static language onto dynamic idea expression). The pedagogical implications as well as future research directions are also discussed. Alternate abstract: 本文汇报一项研究，考察读写结合任务对词汇学习及保持的作用及创造性构造、非创造性构造 对促进词汇学习的不同作用。受试为 90 名一年级英语专业学生，被随机分配到两个实验组（续写 组、复述组）及一个控制组，每组30人。结果表明，续写组产出了大量的创造性构造，其创造性模仿 产出也显著多于复述组。续写组接受性词汇知识及产出性词汇知识的获得及保持都优于复述组， 两组之间的差异仅就产出性知识的保持来说具有显著差异。续写组产出性词汇知识的保持与创造 性模仿呈显著正相关，而与语言协同本身不显著相关。由于产出性词汇知识构成了学习者在动态 语境中运用词汇知识表达思想的能力，研究结果提供了证据，表明创造性模仿可以解决二语学习的 根本性问题（即将静态语言适配到动态思想表达）。最后本文讨论了本研究对教学的启示及未来研 究的方向。

Abstract: Research has demonstrated that active learning, spaced education, and retrieval-based practice can improve knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and clinical practice. Furthermore, learners prefer active learning modalities that use the testing effect and spaced education as compared to passive, lecture-based education. However, most research has been performed with students and residents rather than practicing physicians. To date, most continuing medical education (CME) opportunities use passive learning models, such as face-to-face meetings with lecture-style didactic sessions. The aim of this study was to investigate learner engagement, as measured by the number of CME credits earned, via two different learning modalities.

The aim of this study was to investigate learner engagement, as measured by the number of CME credits earned, via two different learning modalities.Diplomates of the American Board of Anesthesiology or candidates for certification through the board (referred to colloquially and for the remainder of this article as board certified or board eligible) were provided an opportunity to enroll in the study. Participants were recruited via email. Once enrolled, they were randomized into 1 of 2 groups: web-app-based CME (Webapp CME) or an online interface that replicated online CME (Online CME). The intervention period lasted 6 weeks and participants were provided educational content using one of the two approaches. As an incentive for participation, CME credits could be earned (without cost) during the intervention period and for completion of the postintervention quiz. The same number of CME credits was available to each group.

The same number of CME credits was available to each group.Fifty-four participants enrolled and completed the study. The mean number of CME credits earned was greater in the Webapp group compared to the Online group (12.3 ± 1.4 h versus 4.5 ± 2.3 h, P < .001). Concerning knowledge acquisition, the difference in postintervention quiz scores was not statistically significant (Webapp 70% ± 7% versus Online 60% ± 11%, P = .11). However, only 29% of the Online group completed the postintervention quiz, versus 77% of the Webapp group ( P < .001), possibly showing a greater rate of learner engagement in the Webapp group.

Further research with larger trials is needed to confirm our findings. CONCLUSION In this prospective, randomized controlled pilot study, we demonstrated that daily spaced education delivered to learners through a smartphone web app resulted in greater learner engagement than an online modality.

Abstract: Background : The Walking Classroom is an education program that provides students with an opportunity to accumulate physical activity without losing instructional time. Method : This research tests Kuczala’s application of kinesthetic learning theory through measuring knowledge retention, postactivity information processing, and mood in students who engage in a short bout of physical activity while listening to Walking Classroom podcasts about language arts, science, and history, and those who remain seated during a podcast, compared with baseline levels. Students from 9 high-poverty fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms (n = 319) in a North Carolina county comprised the sample. Results : Utilizing multivariate analysis of covariance, the results demonstrate significantly higher levels of learning while walking compared with learning while sitting. Measures of mood utilizing the 10-item version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale also demonstrated a significant effect in predicted directions. Conclusion : The results support that coupling physical activity with instruction leads to increased performance and mood for elementary school students.

Abstract: Objective This study aims to compare the effect of question-answer and Kahoot method reinforcement on nursing students' success and motivation levels. Materials and methods This quasi-experiment study was carried out with 65 students studying at the nursing department at a state university in Turkey. The research data were obtained between November 2019 and February 2020. The study sample was divided into two groups as question-answer and Kahoot. In the first stage of the research, 8 h of training were given to all 65 students on the subject "Infection Control and Precautions," applying the method of teaching by presentation. Shortly after the training, the Kahoot group was reinforced on the Kahoot platform and the Question-answer group in PowerPoint, using the same questions for 30 min. In the second stage of the study, one day after the training, "Student Information Form" and "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" were filled out, and "Achievement Test 1" was implemented. In the third stage, "Achievement Test 2" was executed two months after the training to test longer term knowledge retention. Results The Kahoot group students had a score of 66.63 ± 11.02 in the "Achievement Test 1" and 67.76 ± 15.62 in the question-answer group. It was determined that the total score average of the students in the Kahoot group "Achievement Test 2" was 51.25 ± 13.42, and the students in the question-answer group were 47.03 ± 12.61. Accordingly, there was no statistically significant difference between the "Achievement Test 1" and "Achievement Test 2" mean scores of the students in the question-answer and Kahoot group (p > 0.05). The total score average of the question-answer group for "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" was 127.88 ± 13.64, while the Kahoot group was 126.28 ± 16.88. It was determined that there was no statistically significant relationship between the "Achievement Test 1", "Achievement Test 2" and the "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" total score and sub-dimensions of the students in the Question-Answer group and Kahoot group (p > 0.05). Conclusion In the study analyzing the effect of reinforcement by the question-answer or Kahoot method on nursing students' success and motivation levels, it was concluded that no method was superior.

Abstract: Importance Manipulatives are hands‐on or virtual displays that facilitate teaching and learning and are interactive and engaging to students during the learning activity. Manipulatives have been shown to be effective teaching tools for a wide range of students. Objective This study examined whether the use of manipulatives in nursing education improved Satisfaction, Learning/Knowledge Retention, Behavior/Transfer of Learning, and Intentions to Change Practice. Underpinning theoretical frameworks included Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation Model and Theory of Planned Behavior. Design, Setting, and Participants A quasi‐experimental design comparing lecture to manipulative training was used with a sample of nursing interns and students. The study manipulative was a hands‐on tool that demonstrated physiologic changes that occur with fluid imbalances. Data were collected using three questionnaires (1) before training, which included demographics and questions on participants' level of comfort with fluid imbalances, (2) immediately following training, which evaluated Satisfaction, Learning, Behavior, and Intentions, and (3) 6–8 weeks after training, which evaluated Learning, Behavior, and Intentions. Measures Independent sample t‐test , Mann–Whitney U test, and repeated‐measure analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. Conclusion Findings revealed significant differences in Intentions to change practice ( p  = 0.014), indicating the manipulative had a greater potential effect on clinical practice compared to the lecture.

Abstract: Background: Medical resident reading and information-seeking behavior is limited by time constraints as well as comfort in accessing and assessing evidence-based resources. Educational technology interventions, as the preferred method for millennial leaners, can reduce these barriers. We implemented an educational web tool, consisting of peer-reviewed articles as well as local and national protocols and policies, built into the daily workflow of a university-based anesthesiology department. We hypothesized that this web tool would increase resource utilization and overall perceptions of the educational environment. Objective: The goal of this study was to demonstrate that an educational web tool designed and built into the daily workflow of an academic anesthesia department for trainees could significantly decrease barriers to resource utilization, improve faculty-trainee teaching interactions, and improve the perceptions of the educational environment. Methods: Following Institutional Review Board approval, a longitudinal cohort survey study was conducted to assess trainee resource utilization, faculty evaluation of trainees’ resource utilization, and trainee and faculty perceptions about the educational environment. The survey study was conducted in a pre-post fashion 3 months prior to web tool implementation and 3 months following implementation. Data were deidentified and analyzed unpaired using Student t tests for continuous data and chi-square tests for ordinal data. Results: Survey response rates were greater than 50% in all groups: of the 43 trainees, we obtained 27 (63%) preimplementation surveys and 22 (51%) postimplementation surveys; of the 46 faculty members, we obtained 25 (54%) preimplementation surveys and 23 (50%) postimplementation surveys. Trainees showed a significant improvement in utilization of peer-reviewed articles (preimplementation mean 8.67, SD 6.45; postimplementation mean 18.27, SD 12.23; P =.02), national guidelines (preimplementation mean 2.3, SD 2.40; postimplementation mean 6.14, SD 5.01; P <.001), and local policies and protocols (preimplementation mean 2.23, SD 2.72; postimplementation mean 6.95, SD 6.09; P =.02). There was significant improvement in faculty-trainee educational interactions (preimplementation mean 1.67, SD 1.33; postimplementation mean 6.05, SD 8.74; P =.01). Faculty assessment of trainee resource utilization also demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all resource categories. Subgroups among trainees and faculty showed similar trends toward improvement. Conclusions: Learning technology interventions significantly decrease the barriers to resource utilization, particularly among millennial learners. Further investigation has been undertaken to assess how this may impact learning, knowledge retention, and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Introduction Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is well described in medical education but there has been little research on its application in simulation-based education (SBE). This exploratory study aimed to determine the perceptions of senior medical students at two universities to teaching and learning in SBE using PAL (PAL-SBE). Methods Ninety-seven medical students at two universities working in small groups with facilitator oversight wrote, ran and debriefed a simulation scenario for their peers. This was a mixed-methods study. Participants completed a written free-text and Likert survey instrument, and participated in a facilitated focus group immediately after the scenario. Thematic analysis was performed on the free-text and focus group transcripts. Results Student-led scenarios ran without major technical issues. Instructor presence was required throughout scenario delivery and debrief, making the exercise resource intensive. Participant responses were more positive regarding learning as peer teachers in simulation than they were regarding participation as a peer learner. Five themes were identified: learning in the simulated environment; teaching in the simulated environment; teaching peers and taking on an educator role; learning from peers; and time and effort expended. Perceived benefits included learning in depth through scenario writing, improved knowledge retention, understanding the patient’s perspective and learning to give feedback through debriefing. Conclusion PAL in SBE is feasible and was perceived positively by students. Perceived benefits appear to be greater for the peer teachers than for peer learners.

Abstract: The Walking Classroom is an education program that provides students with an opportunity to accumulate physical activity without losing instructional time. BACKGROUND The Walking Classroom is an education program that provides students with an opportunity to accumulate physical activity without losing instructional time.This research tests Kuczala's application of kinesthetic learning theory through measuring knowledge retention, postactivity information processing, and mood in students who engage in a short bout of physical activity while listening to Walking Classroom podcasts about language arts, science, and history, and those who remain seated during a podcast, compared with baseline levels. Students from 9 high-poverty fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms (n = 319) in a North Carolina county comprised the sample. METHOD This research tests Kuczala's application of kinesthetic learning theory through measuring knowledge retention, postactivity information processing, and mood in students who engage in a short bout of physical activity while listening to Walking Classroom podcasts about language arts, science, and history, and those who remain seated during a podcast, compared with baseline levels. Students from 9 high-poverty fourth- and fifth-grade classrooms (n = 319) in a North Carolina county comprised the sample.Utilizing multivariate analysis of covariance, the results demonstrate significantly higher levels of learning while walking compared with learning while sitting. Measures of mood utilizing the 10-item version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale also demonstrated a significant effect in predicted directions. RESULTS Utilizing multivariate analysis of covariance, the results demonstrate significantly higher levels of learning while walking compared with learning while sitting. Measures of mood utilizing the 10-item version of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale also demonstrated a significant effect in predicted directions.The results support that coupling physical activity with instruction leads to increased performance and mood for elementary school students. CONCLUSION The results support that coupling physical activity with instruction leads to increased performance and mood for elementary school students.

Abstract: Purpose The high turnover rate of knowledge workers presents a challenge to both organizational and personal knowledge management. Although personal knowledge management plays an important role in organizational knowledge management, empirical research on the practices for its application is underdeveloped. This study aims to examine the role of idiosyncratic job-design practices (i.e. job definition, job autonomy, innovation as a job requirement and lifelong learning orientation) in cultivating personal knowledge management among knowledge workers in organizations, to increase their productivity and safeguard the organization against knowledge loss arising from knowledge workers’ interfirm mobility. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 221 knowledge workers pursuing various knowledge-intensive jobs through a questionnaire survey and were analysed using partial least squares modelling. Findings The results demonstrated that three job-design practices (job definition, innovation as a job requirement and lifelong learning orientation) have a positive impact on personal knowledge management among knowledge workers and thus improve their productivity. However, job autonomy can affect personal knowledge management negatively. Research limitations/implications The findings are confined to a specific context and should be replicated across different contexts for better generalizability in future research. Practical implications Organizational managers should pay attention to (re)designing knowledge-intensive jobs to cultivate personal knowledge management by clearly outlining job responsibilities, offering opportunities to add relevant job activities and drop irrelevant ones, and making innovation and lifelong learning a formal job requirement. In addition, job autonomy should be judiciously provided along with sufficient social and network support to avoid lost opportunities in knowledge creation and sharing, and should be linked to job responsibilities and performance appraisals to avoid negative effects. Originality/value The high turnover rate of knowledge workers presents a challenge to both organizational and personal knowledge management. This study contributes to the literature by addressing the research gap in two aspects. Firstly, based on Drucker’s theory, this study identifies four idiosyncratic job-design practices (job definition, job autonomy, innovation as a job requirement and lifelong learning orientation) that reflect the distinctive characteristics of knowledge-intensive work. Secondly, this study examines whether and how these practices can cultivate personal knowledge management among knowledge workers, which can support their productivity.

Abstract: This study aims to compare the effect of question-answer and Kahoot method reinforcement on nursing students' success and motivation levels. OBJECTIVE This study aims to compare the effect of question-answer and Kahoot method reinforcement on nursing students' success and motivation levels.This quasi-experiment study was carried out with 65 students studying at the nursing department at a state university in Turkey. The research data were obtained between November 2019 and February 2020. The study sample was divided into two groups as question-answer and Kahoot. In the first stage of the research, 8 h of training were given to all 65 students on the subject "Infection Control and Precautions," applying the method of teaching by presentation. Shortly after the training, the Kahoot group was reinforced on the Kahoot platform and the Question-answer group in PowerPoint, using the same questions for 30 min. In the second stage of the study, one day after the training, "Student Information Form" and "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" were filled out, and "Achievement Test 1" was implemented. In the third stage, "Achievement Test 2" was executed two months after the training to test longer term knowledge retention.

In the second stage of the study, one day after the training, "Student Information Form" and "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" were filled out, and "Achievement Test 1" was implemented. In the third stage, "Achievement Test 2" was executed two months after the training to test longer term knowledge retention.The Kahoot group students had a score of 66.63 ± 11.02 in the "Achievement Test 1" and 67.76 ± 15.62 in the question-answer group. It was determined that the total score average of the students in the Kahoot group "Achievement Test 2" was 51.25 ± 13.42, and the students in the question-answer group were 47.03 ± 12.61. Accordingly, there was no statistically significant difference between the "Achievement Test 1" and "Achievement Test 2" mean scores of the students in the question-answer and Kahoot group (p > 0.05). The total score average of the question-answer group for "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" was 127.88 ± 13.64, while the Kahoot group was 126.28 ± 16.88. It was determined that there was no statistically significant relationship between the "Achievement Test 1", "Achievement Test 2" and the "Instructional Materials Motivation Scale" total score and sub-dimensions of the students in the Question-Answer group and Kahoot group (p > 0.05). RESULTS The Kahoot group students had a score of 66.63 ± 11.02 in the "Achievement Test 1" and 67.76 ± 15.62 in the question-answer group. It was determined that the total score average of the students in the Kahoot group "Achievement Test 2" was 51.25 ± 13.42, and the students in the question-answer group were 47.03 ± 12.61.

Abstract: Manipulatives are hands-on or virtual displays that facilitate teaching and learning and are interactive and engaging to students during the learning activity. Manipulatives have been shown to be effective teaching tools for a wide range of students. IMPORTANCE Manipulatives are hands-on or virtual displays that facilitate teaching and learning and are interactive and engaging to students during the learning activity. Manipulatives have been shown to be effective teaching tools for a wide range of students.This study examined whether the use of manipulatives in nursing education improved Satisfaction, Learning/Knowledge Retention, Behavior/Transfer of Learning, and Intentions to Change Practice. Underpinning theoretical frameworks included Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation Model and Theory of Planned Behavior. OBJECTIVE This study examined whether the use of manipulatives in nursing education improved Satisfaction, Learning/Knowledge Retention, Behavior/Transfer of Learning, and Intentions to Change Practice. Underpinning theoretical frameworks included Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation Model and Theory of Planned Behavior.A quasi-experimental design comparing lecture to manipulative training was used with a sample of nursing interns and students. The study manipulative was a hands-on tool that demonstrated physiologic changes that occur with fluid imbalances. Data were collected using three questionnaires (1) before training, which included demographics and questions on participants' level of comfort with fluid imbalances, (2) immediately following training, which evaluated Satisfaction, Learning, Behavior, and Intentions, and (3) 6-8 weeks after training, which evaluated Learning, Behavior, and Intentions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A quasi-experimental design comparing lecture to manipulative training was used with a sample of nursing interns and students. The study manipulative was a hands-on tool that demonstrated physiologic changes that occur with fluid imbalances. Data were collected using three questionnaires (1) before training, which included demographics and questions on participants' level of comfort with fluid imbalances, (2) immediately following training, which evaluated Satisfaction, Learning, Behavior, and Intentions, and (3) 6-8 weeks after training, which evaluated Learning, Behavior, and Intentions.Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and repeated-measure analysis of variance were used to analyze the data. MEASURES Independent sample t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, and repeated-measure analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.Findings revealed significant differences in Intentions to change practice (p = 0.014), indicating the manipulative had a greater potential effect on clinical practice compared to the lecture. CONCLUSION Findings revealed significant differences in Intentions to change practice (p = 0.014), indicating the manipulative had a greater potential effect on clinical practice compared to the lecture.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has a wide variety of potentials for education. Especially 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos can provide immersive educational experiences of otherwise not accessible real-world environments. But what potential do 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos in VR and real VR settings have for teaching? Research into the use of real VR, providing live-learning experience in the classroom is still scarce, which is why this article investigates this issue in the context of a systematic review. We discuss use cases, advantages, and limitations as well as interaction characteristics of the potential of 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos, and also the promises of real VR scenarios. By analyzing 64 articles in-depth, our results suggest that 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos can be used for a wide variety of topics. While only a few articles report technological benefits, there are indicators that 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos can benefit learning processes in terms of performance, motivation, and knowledge retention. Most papers report positive effects on other human factors such as presence, perception, engagement, emotions, and empathy. Furthermore, an open research gap has been identified in use cases for real VR.Virtual reality (VR) has a wide variety of potentials for education.

Abstract: Objective: This study compared learning and skill transfer among university aviation students using interactive Augmented Reality (AR) technology versus traditional paper-based instruction. While similar AR use and research in university education exists, this study piloted a comparative method assessing knowledge retention and transfer. Background: AR technology is a popular tool used in technical education. But learner behaviors observed like game play and exploration during this study could impact future learning strategy design as AR use increases. Method: 36 university undergraduate students enrolled in a university aeronautical engineering technology program were divided into AR and paper-based groups and compared on first-time task execution times for starting an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU). A two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing times for task completion was used. Results: Learner task times using AR were consistently faster, replicating similar AR studies, compared to learners using paper-based. However, AR test subjects also took longer interacting with the technology, including gaming-style “play” and exploration of the digital twin AR flight deck environment. This is believed to enhance learner innovation, knowledge retention and transfer, warranting further study. Conclusion: AR users had significantly reduced task execution times. Pre-task “gamification and play” were also observed among the AR users, which could impact how educators and the industry assess and leverage learning strategies when using AR for job task training.

Abstract: Nephrotic syndrome is a unique clinical disorder, which provides interesting teaching opportunities that connect physiological and pathological aspects to clinical practice. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was not permitted, thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills teaching. A case-based electronic learning (e-learning) activity was designed to replace the traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. e-Learning activities have been shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners' performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with e-learning activities as the sole form of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education. BACKGROUND Nephrotic syndrome is a unique clinical disorder, which provides interesting teaching opportunities that connect physiological and pathological aspects to clinical practice. During the current COVID-19 outbreak, in-person teaching in our institution was not permitted, thus creating a unique challenge for clinical skills teaching. A case-based electronic learning (e-learning) activity was designed to replace the traditional in-person teaching of renal semiology. e-Learning activities have been shown to be effective for knowledge retention and increasing novice learners' performance. However, major knowledge gaps exist concerning the satisfaction of learners with e-learning activities as the sole form of teaching, specifically for undergraduate clinical skills education.Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students' perceptions of and satisfaction with an e-learning activity teaching renal semiology. OBJECTIVE Our study aimed to prospectively assess undergraduate medical students' perceptions of and satisfaction with an e-learning activity teaching renal semiology.All second-year medical students (novice learners) from the medical faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, undertook the e-learning activity and were invited to participate in a nonmandatory, validated web-based survey, comprising questions answered using a 10-point Likert scale and one qualitative open-ended question. For comparison and to provide further insights, 17 fourth- to sixth-year students (advanced learners) were prospectively recruited to participate in both the e-learning activity and the evaluation. A mixed methods analysis was performed. METHODS All second-year medical students (novice learners) from the medical faculty of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, undertook the e-learning activity and were invited to participate in a nonmandatory, validated web-based survey, comprising questions answered using a 10-point Likert scale and one qualitative open-ended question. For comparison and to provide further insights, 17 fourth- to sixth-year students (advanced learners) were prospectively recruited to participate in both the e-learning activity and the evaluation. A mixed methods analysis was performed.A total of 88 (63%) out of 141 novice learners and all advanced learners responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction with the e-learning activity (mean 8.7, SD 1.0 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.8; P<.001), clarity of objectives (mean 9.6, SD 0.8 vs mean 7.7, SD 1.7; P<.001), and attainability of objectives (mean 9.8, SD 0.5 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.3; P<.001). Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of a blended learning approach; however, there was low interest in the activity being the sole means of teaching. RESULTS A total of 88 (63%) out of 141 novice learners and all advanced learners responded to the evaluation survey. Advanced learners reported significantly higher satisfaction with the e-learning activity (mean 8.7, SD 1.0 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.8; P<.001), clarity of objectives (mean 9.6, SD 0.8 vs mean 7.7, SD 1.7; P<.001), and attainability of objectives (mean 9.8, SD 0.5 vs mean 7.3, SD 1.3; P<.001). Both groups showed high interest in the inclusion of the activity as part of a blended learning approach; however, there was low interest in the activity being the sole means of teaching.Case-based e-learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners' satisfaction within a blended teaching instructional design. More research on students' satisfaction with e-learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done. In addition, more effort should be put into finding alternative teaching tools for clinical skills education in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future health crises. CONCLUSIONS Case-based e-learning activities might be better suited for advanced learners and could increase learners' satisfaction within a blended teaching instructional design. More research on students' satisfaction with e-learning activities in the field of clinical skills education should be done.

Abstract: Learning from streaming tasks leads a model to catastrophically erase unique experiences it absorbs from previous episodes. While regularization techniques such as LWF, SI, EWC have proven themselves as an effective avenue to overcome this issue by constraining important parameters of old tasks from changing when accepting new concepts, these approaches do not exploit common information of each task which can be shared to existing neurons. As a result, they do not scale well to large-scale problems since the parameter importance variables quickly explode. An Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping (ISYANA) is proposed here to underpin knowledge retention for continual learning. ISYANA combines task-to-neuron relationship as well as concept-to-concept relationship such that it prevents a neuron to embrace distinct concepts while merely accepting relevant concept. Numerical study in the benchmark continual learning problems has been carried out followed by comparison against prominent continual learning algorithms. ISYANA exhibits competitive performance compared to state of the arts. Codes of ISYANA is made available in https://github.com/ContinualAL/ISYANAKBS.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Local ecological knowledge (LEK), including but not limited to the use of wild food plants, plays a large role in sustainable natural resource management schemes, primarily due to the synergy between plants and people. There are calls for the study of LEK in culturally diverse areas due to a loss of knowledge, the active practice of utilizing wild plants in various parts of the world, and a decline in biodiversity. An ethnobotanical study in a border region of Latvia, characterised by diverse natural landscapes and people with deep spiritual attachments to nature, provided an opportunity for such insight, as well as the context to analyse wild food plant usages among different sociocultural groups, allowing us to explore the differences among these groups. Semi-structured interviews were carried out as part of a wider ethnobotanical field study to obtain information about wild food plants and their uses. The list of wild food plant uses, derived from 72 interviews, revealed a high level of homogenisation (in regards to knowledge) among the study groups, and that many local uses of wild food plants are still actively practiced. People did not gather plants as a recreational activity but rather as a source of diet diversification. The results provide evidence of the importance of safeguarding ecological and cultural diversity due to high local community dependency on natural resources.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Larsen & Shirey (2020) criticised our analysis of latitudinal changes in butterfly phenology on the grounds of improper data management. We admit some imprecisions, but show that stringent reanalyses did not change the overall results. We also show that unreasonable treatment of data may result in critical information loss.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Loss of knowledge about historical environmental conditions and species’ abundances threatens how new generations potentially perceive their environment and take action. The intergenerational shift in perceptions of environmental thresholds is a phenomenon frequently termed shifting baseline syndrome (SBS). The goals of this study were (1) to determine relationships between ordinal scores (e.g., few, many) and quantitative measures (e.g., estimates of population size) used by members of a Māori community in New Zealand to score indicators for understanding the abundance of forest resources, and (2) to then analyze these relationships according to people’s age to detect the effects of SBS and the rate that this shift was occurring for each indicator. We detected consistent relationships between the ordinal scores and quantitative measures for six forest indicators provided by community members. However, there was only a high degree of confidence about the direction of the age effect for three abundance indicators (Kererū [New Zealand Pigeon], Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae, 15% increase [CI = 5.1–27.1%] in flock size for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; long‐finned eel, Anguilla dieffenbachia, 30% decrease [CI = −45.1% to −11.3%] in the distance (m) walked along a riverbank between observations of an eel for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; and Australian brush‐tailed possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, 27% decrease [CI = −38.9% to −13.9%] in the distance (m) walked through forest between observations of possum sign for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age), but the effect was statistically strong for all three. The decoupling of indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) from their traditional lands and biodiversity by an array of political, environmental, social and economic drivers and feedback mechanisms have contributed to and exacerbated the conditions for SBS. However, the protection of customary practices to engage with the environment, including the harvest of natural resources, community‐based environmental monitoring initiatives, and cultural immersion education programs offer opportunities for IPLC to mitigate the often deleterious effects of SBS.

In considering non-transactional outcomes—specifically brand attitude formation and information dissemination—one finds that two literature streams emerge, although they present different recommendations. First, cognitive attitude formation research recommends designing interfaces to promote an efficient experience that takes less time and requires less movement among webpages. On the other hand, the mere exposure literature recommends that longer durations and more exposure to related ideas should improve non-transactional outcomes. To understand the relationship between these two perspectives, we tested related hypotheses in a within-subjects observational experiment with a follow-up survey 10 days later. Building on theory regarding task characteristics, we also included goal-directedness as a hypothesized moderating variable. We found that more time spent on a website was associated with greater brand attitude improvement and product knowledge retention, but that more webpage views was associated with reduced product knowledge. In addition, the task type influenced the relationships between webpages viewed and brand attitude and between time spent and product knowledge retention.

Abstract: Loss of knowledge about historical environmental conditions and species' abundances threatens how new generations potentially perceive their environment and take action. The intergenerational shift in perceptions of environmental thresholds is a phenomenon frequently termed shifting baseline syndrome (SBS). The goals of this study were (1) to determine relationships between ordinal scores (e.g., few, many) and quantitative measures (e.g., estimates of population size) used by members of a Māori community in New Zealand to score indicators for understanding the abundance of forest resources, and (2) to then analyze these relationships according to people's age to detect the effects of SBS and the rate that this shift was occurring for each indicator. We detected consistent relationships between the ordinal scores and quantitative measures for six forest indicators provided by community members. However, there was only a high degree of confidence about the direction of the age effect for three abundance indicators (Kererū [New Zealand Pigeon], Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae, 15% increase [CI = 5.1–27.1%] in flock size for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; long-finned eel, Anguilla dieffenbachia, 30% decrease [CI = −45.1% to −11.3%] in the distance (m) walked along a riverbank between observations of an eel for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; and Australian brush-tailed possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, 27% decrease [CI = −38.9% to −13.9%] in the distance (m) walked through forest between observations of possum sign for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age), but the effect was statistically strong for all three. The decoupling of indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) from their traditional lands and biodiversity by an array of political, environmental, social and economic drivers and feedback mechanisms have contributed to and exacerbated the conditions for SBS. However, the protection of customary practices to engage with the environment, including the harvest of natural resources, community-based environmental monitoring initiatives, and cultural immersion education programs offer opportunities for IPLC to mitigate the often deleterious effects of SBS.

Abstract: Multimedia in blended learning provides the ability to enhance students’ performance and satisfaction. Microlectures are one type of multimedia that comprise of short modular videos that introduce basic theoretical concepts. Literature provides limited insight into how this specific format supports engineering classrooms. This study, therefore, explored what the benefit of flipped microlecture classes is for students in a course with mainly traditional face-to-face lectures. To this end, we allocated ten students to a flipped microlecture and twelve to a traditional lecture setting; conducted pre and post-tests; and, organised a focus group. Results show a positive effect of the flipped microlecture class on the test performance. Students’ qualitative evaluations also indicate their satisfaction with increased control over learning, reduced discomfort of traditional lecture settings, enhanced classroom interaction, and better knowledge retention. These findings resonate with blended learning and multimedia literature and support future decision making about microlectures in engineering education.

Abstract: The emergency care of time-sensitive injuries and illnesses is increasingly recognized as an essential component of effective health care systems. However, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack healthcare providers formally trained in the care of emergency conditions. The Disease Control Priorities 3 project estimates that effective emergency care systems could avert up to half of all premature deaths in LMICs. Nigeria, a lower-middle income country of nearly 200 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, could save approximately 100,000 lives per year with an effective emergency care system. The World Health Organization developed the Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course to train frontline healthcare workers in the management of emergency conditions in low resource settings. In this study we describe our work implementing the BEC course Nigeria. Background The emergency care of time-sensitive injuries and illnesses is increasingly recognized as an essential component of effective health care systems. However, many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack healthcare providers formally trained in the care of emergency conditions. The Disease Control Priorities 3 project estimates that effective emergency care systems could avert up to half of all premature deaths in LMICs. Nigeria, a lower-middle income country of nearly 200 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, could save approximately 100,000 lives per year with an effective emergency care system. The World Health Organization developed the Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course to train frontline healthcare workers in the management of emergency conditions in low resource settings. In this study we describe our work implementing the BEC course Nigeria.This study was designed as a mixed methods research analysis comparing pre- and post- course examination results and surveys to evaluate participant knowledge acquisition and levels of confidence with management of various emergency conditions. Thirty-two participants were involved in the course which took place over four days at the Lagos University Teaching hospital. Quantitative data was analyzed using Stata 14.2 (College Station, TX). Paired data sets were analyzed using McNemar's chi-squared. Unpaired data sets were analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

The average pre-course test score was 73% and average post-course score was 86.5%. Pre- and post-course questionnaires demonstrated significantly increased confidence in managing emergency conditions and agreement with course objectives. Results Post-course test scores showed significant improvement (p-value <0.001) as compared to pre-course. The average pre-course test score was 73% and average post-course score was 86.5%. Pre- and post-course questionnaires demonstrated significantly increased confidence in managing emergency conditions and agreement with course objectives.The WHO Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course successfully increased the knowledge and confidence of frontline emergency care providers in Nigeria. The course was well received by participants. Future study should focus on BEC course scalability and long-term knowledge retention. Conclusions The WHO Basic Emergency Care (BEC) course successfully increased the knowledge and confidence of frontline emergency care providers in Nigeria. The course was well received by participants. Future study should focus on BEC course scalability and long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: Loss of knowledge about historical environmental conditions and species' abundances threatens how new generations potentially perceive their environment and take action. The intergenerational shift in perceptions of environmental thresholds is a phenomenon frequently termed shifting baseline syndrome (SBS). The goals of this study were (1) to determine relationships between ordinal scores (e.g., few, many) and quantitative measures (e.g., estimates of population size) used by members of a Māori community in New Zealand to score indicators for understanding the abundance of forest resources, and (2) to then analyze these relationships according to people's age to detect the effects of SBS and the rate that this shift was occurring for each indicator. We detected consistent relationships between the ordinal scores and quantitative measures for six forest indicators provided by community members. However, there was only a high degree of confidence about the direction of the age effect for three abundance indicators (Kererū [New Zealand Pigeon], Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae, 15% increase [CI = 5.1-27.1%] in flock size for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; long-finned eel, Anguilla dieffenbachia, 30% decrease [CI = -45.1% to -11.3%] in the distance (m) walked along a riverbank between observations of an eel for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age; and Australian brush-tailed possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, 27% decrease [CI = -38.9% to -13.9%] in the distance (m) walked through forest between observations of possum sign for any given ordinal category for each decade increase in age), but the effect was statistically strong for all three. The decoupling of indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLC) from their traditional lands and biodiversity by an array of political, environmental, social and economic drivers and feedback mechanisms have contributed to and exacerbated the conditions for SBS. However, the protection of customary practices to engage with the environment, including the harvest of natural resources, community-based environmental monitoring initiatives, and cultural immersion education programs offer opportunities for IPLC to mitigate the often deleterious effects of SBS.Loss of knowledge about historical environmental conditions and species' abundances threatens how new generations potentially perceive their environment and take action.

Abstract: Keywords: peer teaching, top 200 drugs, drug knowledge, student confidence INTRODUCTION In 2016, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) updated Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree standards to require colleges of pharmacy to assess readiness to enter advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs), which is commonly referred to as "pre-APPE readiness. Educational research in multiple disciplines has demonstrated that repeated opportunities to recall and apply new knowledge is crucial to knowledge retention.7,8 Deficiencies in students' retention of drug information have been reportedas an area ofconcern in other pharmacy programs. The objective of this study was to describe the design and incorporation of this peer teaching series and its impact on student confidence and performance on a comprehensive, knowledge-based assessment for commonly used medications. Questions were identical in the pre- and post-intervention quizzes and assessed the following drug knowledge categories: drug indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, dosing, side effects, counseling, and drug-drug interactions.

Abstract: For ORT to have a maximum impact on public health it should be used in the community, in the home. A number of programs have been developed over the years to extend ORT to home use. One of the most successful approaches was the Oral Therapy Education Program (OTEP) developed by BRAC, the world's largest NGO. Mothers were taught in the home by an OTEP worker using seven simple messages and a demonstration. The program, which led to high levels of use and knowledge retention, is described. What the OTEP and other successful home-based programs have demonstrated is that home care of diarrhea using ORS can be effectively implemented and can have a positive impact on the reduction of diarrhea morbidity and mortality.For ORT to have a maximum impact on public health it should be used in the community, in the home.

Abstract: Association questions (AQs) are a novel form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To answer an AQ, learners must recall the concepts denoted by the given terms, affirm their connections, and then select the term with a denotation that is “less connected” with other concepts. This research hypothesizes that the use of AQ tests for reviewing course contents can significantly help learners to assimilate and/or accommodate what was covered in class and to store the resulting cognitive structures in long-term memory (LTM). To test this hypothesis, an educational experiment was conducted. The results showed that the use of optional online AQ tests for reviewing course contents helped with knowledge retention and was especially suitable for learners with medium levels of initial knowledge. AQs are easy to answer and grade. Therefore, it should be worthwhile to use AQ tests for formative assessment whenever AQs can be designed to help learners better understand course contents.

Abstract: Association questions (AQs) are a novel form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To answer an AQ, learners must recall the concepts denoted by the given terms, affirm their connections, and then select the term with a denotation that is “less connected” with other concepts. This research hypothesizes that the use of AQ tests for reviewing course contents can significantly help learners to assimilate and/or accommodate what was covered in class and to store the resulting cognitive structures in long-term memory (LTM). To test this hypothesis, an educational experiment was conducted. The results showed that the use of optional online AQ tests for reviewing course contents helped with knowledge retention and was especially suitable for learners with medium levels of initial knowledge. AQs are easy to answer and grade. Therefore, it should be worthwhile to use AQ tests for formative assessment whenever AQs can be designed to help learners better understand course contents.

Abstract: Team‐based learning (TBL) is an active learning method used in many educational institutions. However, there are few examples of its use in basic medicine, such as biochemistry in medical schools. This study used TBL to teach glucose metabolism to first‐year medical students. The process was in four phases: preclass preparation, readiness assurance tests, advanced questions, and a TBL test, with peer evaluation and a questionnaire. There were positive correlations between the TBL test, peer evaluation, and individual readiness test performance. Tests were taken immediately after learning and 2 weeks later, and scores decreased significantly less with TBL than traditional lectures (−2.3% vs. −17.5%). This suggests that TBL was more effective than traditional lectures in supporting knowledge retention. We used a Moodle system to facilitate communication between students and teachers, and this was evaluated positively by both groups. It was particularly useful for managing TBL. These findings suggest that TBL could be used to improve student performance in biochemistry.

Abstract: The shortage of skills together with the knowledge loss due to employee retirements is compelling trade contractors to capture the know-how from retirees to prepare the future workforce. Compared to explicit knowledge, the tacit dimension is relatively unexplored in the construction industry. To capture tacit knowledge, it should be first identified in practice. This research posits an instrument to gauge the reliance of field supervisors on tacit knowledge and identifies barriers to knowledge sharing through case studies involving electrical contractors. Findings reveal that there is a significant relationship between the individual’s experience and reliance on tacit knowledge, especially field supervisors with 20 years of work experience or more. It is also identified that field staff and management have contrasting opinions regarding the ranking of barriers to knowledge sharing. Management prioritized lack of formal processes as the key barrier to knowledge sharing at the site level, whereas for the field team it is the lack of socialization and encouragement. The proposed study will aid trade contractors to strengthen the existing knowledge-harnessing strategies by categorizing the supervisory knowledge into tacit and explicit, simultaneously identifying barriers to its sharing.

Abstract: COVID-19 altered medical education systems worldwide as many medical schools quickly changed to online assessment systems. However, the feasibility of online assessment and how it compares to traditional examinations is unclear. INTRODUCTION COVID-19 altered medical education systems worldwide as many medical schools quickly changed to online assessment systems. However, the feasibility of online assessment and how it compares to traditional examinations is unclear.We compared 4 th year medical students' online surgery clerkship assessment scores to the traditional written examinations. The percent of correct scores using online open-book examination was compared to the results of the traditional closed-book examination in the previous three rotations. Additional correlation between grade point average(GPA) and examination performance were reviewed. METHODS We compared 4th year medical students' online surgery clerkship assessment scores to the traditional written examinations. The percent of correct scores using online open-book examination was compared to the results of the traditional closed-book examination in the previous three rotations. Additional correlation between grade point average(GPA) and examination performance were reviewed.Compared with the traditional groups, medical students who took the online, open-book examination had a significantly higher mean score in both MCQ(85.21 vs. 77.36, 72.43, 83.00, p<0.001) and essay examinations (187.36 vs. 158.77, 152.17, 152.29, p<0.001), but a significantly lower mean score in short answer examination (60.09 vs. 66.79, 67.73, 64.82, p<0.001). The online open-book examination group had a significantly lower correlation between the essay score and their GPA than the previous traditional groups (z=2.81 p=0.005, z=2.23 p=0.026, z=2.19 p=0.029). RESULTS Compared with the traditional groups, medical students who took the online, open-book examination had a significantly higher mean score in both MCQ(85.21 vs. 77.36, 72.43, 83.00, p<0.001) and essay examinations (187.36 vs. 158.77, 152.17, 152.29, p<0.001), but a significantly lower mean score in short answer examination (60.09 vs. 66.79, 67.73, 64.82, p<0.001). The online open-book examination group had a significantly lower correlation between the essay score and their GPA than the previous traditional groups (z=2.81 p=0.005, z=2.23 p=0.026, z=2.19 p=0.029).Although an online, open-book examination was feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study indicates that mean scores are significantly different which has important implications regarding grading and standard setting. More research is required to assess other effects of this new assessment on long-term knowledge retention and application. CONCLUSION Although an online, open-book examination was feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study indicates that mean scores are significantly different which has important implications regarding grading and standard setting. More research is required to assess other effects of this new assessment on long-term knowledge retention and application.

Abstract: Intravenous cannulation is a common procedure and a valuable skill in the neonatal intensive care unit. Standardized procedure and personnel training are needed in the unit to prevent hospital-acquired blood stream infections. Hence, we evaluated the effect of training using a low-fidelity simulation on the improvement of the aseptic non-touch technique during intravenous cannulation and knowledge retention after 6 months. BACKGROUND Intravenous cannulation is a common procedure and a valuable skill in the neonatal intensive care unit. Standardized procedure and personnel training are needed in the unit to prevent hospital-acquired blood stream infections. Hence, we evaluated the effect of training using a low-fidelity simulation on the improvement of the aseptic non-touch technique during intravenous cannulation and knowledge retention after 6 months.The study was conducted in a tertiary care neonatal unit from June 2017 to July 2018. All the staff nurses and junior resident doctors posted in the neonatal intensive care were included in the study. A protocol and checklist score sheet was developed. The score sheet consisted of 23 items with a total score of 46. Participants were expected to obtain a minimum of 80%. A pre-test was conducted initially, followed by a formal training and then a post-test. The NITA newborn venous access mannequin was used to facilitate the training. A re-training for new nurses was conducted after 6 months. Data were analyzed using paired t-test. METHODS The study was conducted in a tertiary care neonatal unit from June 2017 to July 2018.

A re-training for new nurses was conducted after 6 months. Data were analyzed using paired t-test.A total of 29 doctors and nurses were enrolled in the training. The mean pre-test score was 29.93 compared to 42.66 in the post-test scores (mean difference 12.24(95% confidence interval: 9.39-16.05), p < 0.01. The mean scores were higher when the simulation was conducted after 6 months. There was a significant decline in blood stream infection rates from 5.5 to 1.65 per 1000 patient days (p = 0.05). RESULTS A total of 29 doctors and nurses were enrolled in the training. The mean pre-test score was 29.93 compared to 42.66 in the post-test scores (mean difference 12.24(95% confidence interval: 9.39-16.05), p < 0.01.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the importance of correctly using personal protective equipment (PPE). Doffing is a critical phase that increases the risk of contamination of health care workers. Although a gamified electronic learning (e-learning) module has been shown to increase the adequate choice of PPE among prehospital personnel, it failed to enhance knowledge regarding donning and doffing sequences. Adding other training modalities such as face-to-face training to these e-learning tools is therefore necessary to increase prehospital staff proficiency and thus help reduce the risk of contamination. BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the importance of correctly using personal protective equipment (PPE).

Adding other training modalities such as face-to-face training to these e-learning tools is therefore necessary to increase prehospital staff proficiency and thus help reduce the risk of contamination.The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Peyton 4-step approach in addition to a gamified e-learning module for teaching the PPE doffing sequence to first-year paramedic students. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Peyton 4-step approach in addition to a gamified e-learning module for teaching the PPE doffing sequence to first-year paramedic students.Participants will first follow a gamified e-learning module before being randomized into one of two groups. In the control group, participants will be asked to perform a PPE doffing sequence, which will be video-recorded to allow for subsequent assessment. In the experimental group, participants will first undergo face-to-face training performed by third-year students using the Peyton 4-step approach before performing the doffing sequence themselves, which will also be video-recorded. All participants will then be asked to reconstruct the doffing sequence on an online platform. The recorded sequences will be assessed independently by two investigators: a prehospital emergency medicine expert and an infection prevention and control specialist. The assessors will be blinded to group allocation. Four to eight weeks after this first intervention, all participants will be asked to record the doffing sequence once again for a subsequent skill retention assessment and to reconstruct the sequence on the same online platform to assess knowledge retention. Finally, participants belonging to the control group will follow face-to-face training.

Abstract: Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is clinically proven to reduce morbidity and mortality; however, many eligible patients do not enroll in treatment. Furthermore, many enrolled patients do not complete their full course of treatment. This is greatly influenced by socioeconomic factors but is also because of patients’ lack of understanding of the importance of their care and a lack of motivation to maintain attendance. Objective: This study aims to explore the potential benefits of virtual reality (VR) walking trails within CR treatment, specifically with regard to patient knowledge retention, satisfaction with treatment, and the overall attendance of treatment sessions. Methods: New CR patients were enrolled and randomized on a rolling basis to either the control group or intervention group. Intervention patients completed their time on the treadmill with VR walking trails, which included audio-recorded education, whereas control patients completed the standard of care therapy. Both groups were assisted by nursing staff for all treatment sessions. Primary outcomes were determined by assessing 6-minute walk test improvement. In addition, secondary outcomes of patients’ cardiac knowledge and satisfaction were assessed via a computer-based questionnaire; patient adherence to the recommended number of sessions was also monitored. Cardiac knowledge assessment included a prerehabilitation education quiz, and the same quiz was repeated at patients’ final visit and again at the 2-month follow-up. The satisfaction questionnaire was completed at the final visit. Results: Between January 2018 and May 2019, 72 patients were enrolled—41 in the intervention group and 31 in the control group. On the basis of the results of the prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation 6-minute walk test, no significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups (P=.64). No statistical differences were observed between groups in terms of education (P=.86) or satisfaction (P=.32) at any time point. The control group had statistically more favorable rates of attendance, as determined by the risk group comparison (P=.02) and the comparison of the rates for completing the minimum number of sessions (P=.046), but no correlation was observed between the study group and reasons for ending treatment. Conclusions: Although no improvements were seen in the VR intervention group over the control group, it is worth noting that limitations in the study design may have influenced these outcomes, not the medium itself. Furthermore, the qualitative information suggests that patients may have indeed enjoyed their experience with VR, even though quantitative satisfaction data did not capture this. Further considerations for how and when VR should be applied to CR are suggested in this paper. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is clinically proven to reduce morbidity and mortality; however, many eligible patients do not enroll in treatment. Furthermore, many enrolled patients do not complete their full course of treatment. This is greatly influenced by socioeconomic factors but is also because of patients' lack of understanding of the importance of their care and a lack of motivation to maintain attendance. BACKGROUND Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is clinically proven to reduce morbidity and mortality; however, many eligible patients do not enroll in treatment. Furthermore, many enrolled patients do not complete their full course of treatment. This is greatly influenced by socioeconomic factors but is also because of patients' lack of understanding of the importance of their care and a lack of motivation to maintain attendance.This study aims to explore the potential benefits of virtual reality (VR) walking trails within CR treatment, specifically with regard to patient knowledge retention, satisfaction with treatment, and the overall attendance of treatment sessions. OBJECTIVE This study aims to explore the potential benefits of virtual reality (VR) walking trails within CR treatment, specifically with regard to patient knowledge retention, satisfaction with treatment, and the overall attendance of treatment sessions.New CR patients were enrolled and randomized on a rolling basis to either the control group or intervention group. Intervention patients completed their time on the treadmill with VR walking trails, which included audio-recorded education, whereas control patients completed the standard of care therapy. Both groups were assisted by nursing staff for all treatment sessions. Primary outcomes were determined by assessing 6-minute walk test improvement. In addition, secondary outcomes of patients' cardiac knowledge and satisfaction were assessed via a computer-based questionnaire; patient adherence to the recommended number of sessions was also monitored. Cardiac knowledge assessment included a prerehabilitation education quiz, and the same quiz was repeated at patients' final visit and again at the 2-month follow-up. The satisfaction questionnaire was completed at the final visit. METHODS New CR patients were enrolled and randomized on a rolling basis to either the control group or intervention group.

Cardiac knowledge assessment included a prerehabilitation education quiz, and the same quiz was repeated at patients' final visit and again at the 2-month follow-up. The satisfaction questionnaire was completed at the final visit.Between January 2018 and May 2019, 72 patients were enrolled-41 in the intervention group and 31 in the control group. On the basis of the results of the prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation 6-minute walk test, no significant differences were observed between the intervention and control groups (P=.64). No statistical differences were observed between groups in terms of education (P=.86) or satisfaction (P=.32) at any time point. The control group had statistically more favorable rates of attendance, as determined by the risk group comparison (P=.02) and the comparison of the rates for completing the minimum number of sessions (P=.046), but no correlation was observed between the study group and reasons for ending treatment.

Furthermore, the qualitative information suggests that patients may have indeed enjoyed their experience with VR, even though quantitative satisfaction data did not capture this. Further considerations for how and when VR should be applied to CR are suggested in this paper.

Abstract: Video-based teaching has been part of medical education for some time but 360° videos using a virtual reality (VR) device are a new medium that offer extended possibilities. We investigated whether adding a 360° VR video to the internship curriculum leads to an improvement of long-term recall of specific knowledge on a gentle Caesarean Sections (gCS) and on general obstetric knowledge. BACKGROUND Video-based teaching has been part of medical education for some time but 360° videos using a virtual reality (VR) device are a new medium that offer extended possibilities. We investigated whether adding a 360° VR video to the internship curriculum leads to an improvement of long-term recall of specific knowledge on a gentle Caesarean Sections (gCS) and on general obstetric knowledge.Two weeks prior to their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) internship, medical students were divided in teaching groups, that did or did not have access to a VR-video of a gCS. Six weeks after their O&G internship, potentially having observed one or multiple real-life CSs, knowledge on the gCS was assessed with an open questionnaire, and knowledge on general obstetrics with a multiple-choice questionnaire. Furthermore we assessed experienced anxiety during in-person attendance of CSs, and we asked whether the interns would have wanted to attend more CSs in-person. The 360° VR video group was questioned about their experience directly after they watched the video. We used linear regression analyses to determine significant effects on outcomes. METHODS Two weeks prior to their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) internship, medical students were divided in teaching groups, that did or did not have access to a VR-video of a gCS. Six weeks after their O&G internship, potentially having observed one or multiple real-life CSs, knowledge on the gCS was assessed with an open questionnaire, and knowledge on general obstetrics with a multiple-choice questionnaire. Furthermore we assessed experienced anxiety during in-person attendance of CSs, and we asked whether the interns would have wanted to attend more CSs in-person. The 360° VR video group was questioned about their experience directly after they watched the video. We used linear regression analyses to determine significant effects on outcomes.A total of 89 medical students participated, 41 in the 360° VR video group and 48 in the conventional study group. Watching the 360° VR video did not result in a difference in either specific or general knowledge retention between the intervention group and the conventional study group. This was both true for the grade received for the internship, the open-ended questions as well as the multiple-choice questions and this did not change after adjustment for confounding factors. Still, 83.4% of the 360° VR video-group reported that more videos should be used in training to prepare for surgical procedures. In the 360° VR video-group 56.7% reported side effects like nausea or dizziness. After adjustment for the number of attended CSs during the practical internship, students in the 360° VR video-group stated less often (p = 0.04) that they would have liked to attend more CSs in-person as compared to the conventional study group. RESULTS A total of 89 medical students participated, 41 in the 360° VR video group and 48 in the conventional study group.

CONCLUSION Even though the use of 360° VR video did not increase knowledge, it did offer a potential alternative for attending a CS in-person and a new way to prepare the students for their first operating room experiences.

Abstract: Introduction The 2020 coronavirus lockdown lead to medical educators finding new ways to teach. SMILE is a free online access medical education platform created by UK surgical trainees and a medical student that delivered 200 live lectures to students during lockdown, with up to 1500 students from every UK medical school as well as abroad. This study aims to demonstrate line education is an effective tool for knowledge retention. Method Students were invited to participate in three live sessions covering haematuria, bone infections/tumours and endocrine emergencies, in which students complete knowledge assessment over time . Quiz-based polls using zoom were taken before and after each session. After two weeks and again at one month the same quiz questions were sent out to attendees of the lecture. Results 312 students completed all 4 tests. In all three sessions average scores improved post lecture (haematuria 58%-85%; endocrine emergencies 48%-70%; osteomyelitis/bone tumours 40%-77%). At 2 weeks (H 86%; EE 78%; O/BT 75%) and 4 weeks (H 88%; EE 76%; O/BT 69%) scores remained high. Conclusion This study demonstrates that FOAMed is able to engage audiences in a unique way on a large scale with evidence of long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Multisensor Earth observation has significantly accelerated the development of multisensor collaborative remote sensing applications such as all-weather mapping using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and optical images. However, in the real-world application scenarios, not all data sources may be available, namely, the missing-modality problem, e.g., the poor imaging conditions obstruct the optical sensors, and only SAR images are available for the mapping. This real-world scenario raises the challenge of how to leverage historical multisensor data to improve the representation ability of the available model. The knowledge transfer based and knowledge distillation based approaches, as feasible solutions, can be used to transfer knowledge from other sensor models to the available model. However, these approaches suffer from the problem of forgotten knowledge and the multi-modality co-registration problem, which means that the leveraging of historical multisensor data is inefficient. The essential problem lies in the fact that these approaches are designed following the single-sensor data-driven approach. In this paper, a registration-free multisensor data-driven learning method, namely, deep multisensor learning, in a new perspective of knowledge retention, is proposed to overcome the above problems by learning a meta-sensory representation. To explore the existence of the meta-sensory representation, the meta-sensory representation hypothesis is first proposed, which reveals that the essential difference of the deep models trained on data from different sensors lies in the parameter distribution of the sensor-invariant and sensor-specific operations. Based on this hypothesis, a prototype network is proposed to learn the meta-sensory representation by modeling the knowledge retention mechanism, using the proposed difference alignment operation (DiffAlignOp). DiffAlignOp enables the prototype network to dynamically generate sensor-specific networks to gather supervised signals from registration-free multisensor data. This dynamic network generation is differentiable. Therefore, multisensor gradients can be obtained to learn the meta-sensory representation. To demonstrate the flexibility and practicality of deep multisensor learning, the application of all-weather mapping in a missing-modality scenario was performed. The experiments were conducted on a large public multisensor all-weather mapping dataset, which consists of high-resolution optical and SAR imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The experimental results suggest that deep multisensor learning is superior to the other learning approaches in performance and stability, and reveals the importance of meta-sensory representation in multisensor remote sensing applications.

Abstract: This is a refresher curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to augment the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers. Audience and type of curriculum This is a refresher curriculum utilizing multiple methods of education to augment the skills of generalist healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the identification and stabilization of pediatric respiratory emergencies. Our audience of implementation was Belizean generalist providers.Nine hours. Length of curriculum Nine hours.In the pediatric population, early recognition and stabilization can improve patient outcomes. Compared with many Western systems that rely on specialists and even subspecialists, in many lower-resource settings, generalists provide most emergency medical care. The purpose of this module is to present a curriculum focused on the identification and stabilization of common pediatric respiratory emergencies for general practitioners (physicians and nurses) working in the acute care setting. Our aim is to provide a care framework and refresher training for the management of pediatric respiratory emergencies for providers who may regularly see the acutely ill pediatric patient but who may not have had recent or any extensive teaching in the management of acute pediatric airway management, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma.

Our aim is to provide a care framework and refresher training for the management of pediatric respiratory emergencies for providers who may regularly see the acutely ill pediatric patient but who may not have had recent or any extensive teaching in the management of acute pediatric airway management, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and asthma.This curriculum presents a refresher course in recognizing and stabilizing pediatric acute respiratory complaints for generalist healthcare providers practicing in LMICs. Our goal is to implement this curriculum in the small LMIC of Belize. This module focuses on common respiratory complaints, including asthma, bronchiolitis, pneumonia and acute airway management. Educational Goals This curriculum presents a refresher course in recognizing and stabilizing pediatric acute respiratory complaints for generalist healthcare providers practicing in LMICs. Our goal is to implement this curriculum in the small LMIC of Belize. This module focuses on common respiratory complaints, including asthma, bronchiolitis, pneumonia and acute airway management.The educational strategies used in this curriculum include didactic lectures, medical simulation, small-group sessions, and a skills lab. Educational Methods The educational strategies used in this curriculum include didactic lectures, medical simulation, small-group sessions, and a skills lab.We scored written pretests before and posttests after intervention and retested participants to evaluate for knowledge retention. Participants provided qualitative feedback on the module. Research Methods We scored written pretests before and posttests after intervention and retested participants to evaluate for knowledge retention. Participants provided qualitative feedback on the module.We taught 26 providers. Twenty-one providers completed the posttest and eight completed the retest. The mean test scores improved from 8.3 ± 2.8 in the pretest to 9.7 ± 1.3 to the posttest (mean difference = 1.4; P = 0.027). The mean test score at pretest was 8.0 ± 4.0, which increased to 9.9 ± 2.5 at retest four months later (mean difference = 1.9, P = 0.049). Fifteen (71.4%) participants found the course "extremely useful," and 28 (28.5%) participants "very useful." Results We taught 26 providers.

Abstract: Objective: The sudden disruption of university teaching caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced universities to switch to online teaching. It is vital for graduating medical students to learn about COVID-19 because they are likely to treat COVID-19 patients after graduation. We developed a COVID-19 lesson for medical students that used either an online lecture or a serious game that we designed. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a serious game versus online lectures for improving medical students' COVID-19 knowledge. Materials and Methods: From our university's database of knowledge scores, we collected the prelesson, postlesson, and final test knowledge scores of the students who participated in the lesson and conducted a retrospective comparative analysis. Results: An analysis of scores concerning knowledge of COVID-19 from prelesson and postlesson tests shows that both teaching methods produce significant increases in short-term knowledge, with no statistical difference between the two methods ( P > 0.05). The final test scores, however, show that the group of students who used the game-based computer application scored significantly higher in knowledge retention than did the online lecture group ( P = 0.001). Conclusion: In the context of the disruption of traditional university teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the serious game we designed is potentially an effective option for online medical education about COVID-19, particularly in terms of its capacity for improved knowledge retention.

Abstract: The current article examines the importance of educating nursing staff in a long-term care facility (LTCF) on cerumen impactions and the proper administration of cerumenolytics. An educational session on cerumen impactions and cerumenolytic administration was provided to nursing staff with pre-, post-, and follow-up tests. Findings included an increase in confidence levels of the nursing learning objectives post-education, as well as an overall improvement in knowledge retention. According to the nurses surveyed, they had never been educated on either topic. It is estimated that up to 65% of residents aged >65 years living in LTCFs are affected by cerumen impactions and the many symptoms associated with them, including hearing loss. Therefore, education on these topics for nursing staff who care for this high-risk population would be beneficial.

Abstract: Indigenous families are overrepresented among those within Canada who experience food insecurity. Studies have largely focused on northern populations, with less attention paid to southern and urban communities, including the social, cultural, and geographic processes that challenge food security. In this study, we present findings from a decade‐long community‐based study with the Southwest Ontario Aboriginal Health Access Centre (London, Ontario) to examine family perspectives related to the social determinants of food security. These topics were explored through qualitative interviews (n  =  25) and focus groups (n  =  2) with First Nation mothers with young children from the city of London, and a nearby reserve community. Interviewees from both geographies identified a number of socio‐economic challenges including household income and transportation. However, some interviewees also shed light on barriers to healthy eating unique to these Indigenous contexts including access issues such as a lack of grocery stores on‐reserve; loss of knowledge related to the utilization of traditional foods; and the erosion of community, familial, and social supports. Resolving these unique determinants of food security for urban and reserve‐based First Nation families will require a range of economic and culturally specific interventions, particularly those that support development and uptake of Indigenous foodways . Alternate abstract: Appuyer la sécurité alimentaire des familles autochtones à travers l'alimentation traditionnelle autochtone Les familles autochtones sont surreprésentées parmi celles qui, au sein du Canada, connaissent l'insécurité alimentaire. Les études sur le sujet se sont largement concentrées sur les populations nordiques, portant ainsi moins attention aux communautés méridionales et urbaines, notamment en matière de processus sociaux, culturels et géographiques remettant en question la sécurité alimentaire. À l'intérieur de cette étude, nous présentons les conclusions d'une recherche communautaire s'étendant sur une décennie qui a été réalisée en collaboration avec le Centre autochtone d'accès aux soins de santé du sud‐ouest de l'Ontario (London, Ontario). Cette recherche visait à examiner les points de vue des familles reliés aux déterminants sociaux de la sécurité alimentaire. Ces déterminants ont été analysés au moyen d'entrevues qualitatives (n=25) et de groupes de discussion (n=2) avec des mères de Premières Nations ayant de jeunes enfants à London et dans une réserve avoisinante. Les entrevues ont permis de recenser un certain nombre de problèmes socio‐économiques, y compris le revenu des ménages et le transport. Toutefois, certaines personnes interrogées ont également mis en lumière les obstacles à la saine alimentation qui sont propres aux contextes autochtones, c'est‐à‐dire les problèmes d'accès tels que le manque d'épiceries dans la réserve, le manque de connaissances reliées à l'utilisation des aliments traditionnels et l'érosion des soutiens communautaires, familiaux et sociaux. Ces défis particuliers pour la sécurité alimentaire des familles des Premières Nations urbaines et vivant dans des réserves nécessitent un éventail d'interventions de nature économique ou propres à la culture, particulièrement celles qui appuient le développement et l'adoption du mode d'alimentation traditionnelle autochtone .

Abstract: Navigating the beginning of medical school can be challenging for students. The new learning environment and the increased volume and complexity of information presented within a short period of time demand more efficient and effective study strategies. We describe the experience and perspective of a first-year medical student, as well as the adjustment of study strategies based on the application of cognitive load theory and dual processing theory. We provide practical approaches that promote intentional and individualized studying planning and better knowledge retention, which may also improve the wellbeing of the new medical students.Navigating the beginning of medical school can be challenging for students.

Abstract: Objective: The sudden disruption of university teaching caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced universities to switch to online teaching. It is vital for graduating medical students to learn about COVID-19 because they are likely to treat COVID-19 patients after graduation. We developed a COVID-19 lesson for medical students that used either an online lecture or a serious game that we designed. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a serious game versus online lectures for improving medical students' COVID-19 knowledge. Materials and Methods: From our university's database of knowledge scores, we collected the prelesson, postlesson, and final test knowledge scores of the students who participated in the lesson and conducted a retrospective comparative analysis. Results: An analysis of scores concerning knowledge of COVID-19 from prelesson and postlesson tests shows that both teaching methods produce significant increases in short-term knowledge, with no statistical difference between the two methods ( P  > 0.05). The final test scores, however, show that the group of students who used the game-based computer application scored significantly higher in knowledge retention than did the online lecture group ( P  = 0.001). Conclusion: In the context of the disruption of traditional university teaching caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the serious game we designed is potentially an effective option for online medical education about COVID-19, particularly in terms of its capacity for improved knowledge retention.Objective: The sudden disruption of university teaching caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced universities to switch to online teaching.

Abstract: Cancer pain is common and challenging to manage - it is estimated that approximately 30% of cancer patients have pain that is not adequately controlled by analgesia. This paper discusses safe and effective neuroablative treatment options for refractory cancer pain. Current management of cancer pain predominantly focuses on the use of medications, resulting in a relative loss of knowledge of these surgical techniques and the erosion of the skills required to perform them. Here, we review surgical methods of modulating various points of the neural axis with the aim to expand the knowledge base of those managing cancer pain. Integration of neuroablative approaches may lead to higher rates of pain relief, and the opportunity to dose reduce analgesic agents with potential deleterious side effects. With an ever-increasing population of cancer patients, it is essential that neurosurgeons maintain or train in these techniques in tandem with the oncological multi-disciplinary team.Cancer pain is common and challenging to manage - it is estimated that approximately 30% of cancer patients have pain that is not adequately controlled by analgesia.

Abstract: Traditional, instructor led, in-person training of CPR skills has become more challenging due to COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the learning outcomes of standard in-person CPR training (ST) with alternative methods of training such as hybrid or online-only training (AT) on CPR performance, quality, and knowledge among laypersons with no previous CPR training. BACKGROUND Traditional, instructor led, in-person training of CPR skills has become more challenging due to COVID-19 pandemic. We compared the learning outcomes of standard in-person CPR training (ST) with alternative methods of training such as hybrid or online-only training (AT) on CPR performance, quality, and knowledge among laypersons with no previous CPR training.We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant articles from January 1995 to May 2020. Covidence was used to review articles by two independent researchers. Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess quality of the manuscripts. METHODS We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for relevant articles from January 1995 to May 2020. Covidence was used to review articles by two independent researchers. Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool was used to assess quality of the manuscripts.Of the 978 articles screened, twenty met the final inclusion criteria. All included studies had an experimental design and moderate to strong global quality rating. The trainees in ST group performed better on calling 911, time to initiate chest compressions, hand placement and chest compression depth. Trainees in AT group performed better in assessing scene safety, calling for help, response time including initiating first rescue breathing, adequate ventilation volume, compression rates, shorter hands-off time, confidence, willingness to perform CPR, ability to follow CPR algorithm, and equivalent or better knowledge retention than standard teaching methodology. RESULTS Of the 978 articles screened, twenty met the final inclusion criteria. All included studies had an experimental design and moderate to strong global quality rating. The trainees in ST group performed better on calling 911, time to initiate chest compressions, hand placement and chest compression depth. Trainees in AT group performed better in assessing scene safety, calling for help, response time including initiating first rescue breathing, adequate ventilation volume, compression rates, shorter hands-off time, confidence, willingness to perform CPR, ability to follow CPR algorithm, and equivalent or better knowledge retention than standard teaching methodology.AT methods of CPR training provide an effective alternative to the standard in-person CPR for large scale public training. CONCLUSION AT methods of CPR training provide an effective alternative to the standard in-person CPR for large scale public training.

Abstract: Online spaced education (OSE) is a method recognized for promoting long-term knowledge retention, changing behaviors and improving outcomes for students and healthcare professionals. However, there is little evidence about its impacts on patient education. BACKGROUND Online spaced education (OSE) is a method recognized for promoting long-term knowledge retention, changing behaviors and improving outcomes for students and healthcare professionals. However, there is little evidence about its impacts on patient education.The aim of this research was to compare knowledge retention using educational brochure and OSE on individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to verify the impact of educational methods on fall outcome. OBJECTIVES The aim of this research was to compare knowledge retention using educational brochure and OSE on individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to verify the impact of educational methods on fall outcome.Individuals with MS (n = 230) were randomly assigned to two types of patient education-educational brochure (control) and OSE (intervention). During 12 weeks, the intervention group received multiple-choice tests on fall prevention. Knowledge retention, behavior change and fall incidence were assessed before intervention and after 3 and 6 months. The participants' satisfaction with the education method was also evaluated. METHODS Individuals with MS (n = 230) were randomly assigned to two types of patient education-educational brochure (control) and OSE (intervention). During 12 weeks, the intervention group received multiple-choice tests on fall prevention. Knowledge retention, behavior change and fall incidence were assessed before intervention and after 3 and 6 months. The participants' satisfaction with the education method was also evaluated.Knowledge retention was similar between groups, and behavior change was observed in both groups. There was a significant reduction in fall rate in the intervention group, from 0.60 to 0.27 at 6 months (P < 0.001). Participants' satisfaction achieved an average of 8.75, with no differences between groups. RESULTS Knowledge retention was similar between groups, and behavior change was observed in both groups. There was a significant reduction in fall rate in the intervention group, from 0.60 to 0.27 at 6 months (P < 0.001). Participants' satisfaction achieved an average of 8.75, with no differences between groups.Individuals demonstrated significant improvement in fall rate outcome in both groups with no significant difference. In regard to test scores and satisfaction, results were similar between groups. CONCLUSION Individuals demonstrated significant improvement in fall rate outcome in both groups with no significant difference. In regard to test scores and satisfaction, results were similar between groups.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Permanent access to safe drinking water is guaranteed in most industrialized countries, while climate change is turning it into a serious global issue. Knowing how to use the valuable resource water consciously and sustainably requires well-informed and ecologically aware citizens. Environmental education approaches should help develop long-term environmental knowledge, pro-environmental attitudes, and behavior with the overall goal of promoting environmental citizenship. The present study, thus, examines the influence of environmental values on students’ environmental knowledge in a German primary school sample (9–10-year-old students) by providing an authentic, out-of-school learning experience on the topic of fresh water supply. Our approach goes beyond mere correlation analyses by using structural equation modeling (SEM) to measure effects between the two variables. Environmental values were monitored using the Two Major Environmental Values Model (2-MEV) with its two dimensions, Preservation and Utilization of nature. Following a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learners’ knowledge before (T0), directly after (T1), and six weeks after (T2) module participation. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the two-factor-structure of the 2-MEV. Preservation turned out as a direct positive predictor of pre-knowledge (T0) but did not show any significant effect on post-knowledge (T1) and knowledge retention (T2). Utilization displayed a larger albeit negative direct effect on knowledge across all testing times, especially for pre- and post-knowledge. Our findings shed light on the significant impact of anthropocentric attitudes on knowledge acquisition within primary school samples and provided valuable insights into feasible environmental learning approaches.

Abstract: Background and Purpose Prelicensure nursing students lack the situational awareness to promote timely intervention with a patient in septic shock. This study evaluated a multifaceted educational project that determined the impact on nursing students' knowledge retention and time to task (TTT). Methods A quasi-experimental, repeated-measures design was used to evaluate students' knowledge retention and TTT. Eighty-four prelicensure nursing students participated in groups of 4 students to participate in a high-fidelity simulation. Results Results show knowledge retention was significant between the pretest scores and 2 repeated assessment scores. The repeated-measures analysis of variance time effect P value was .02. The overall TTT group response suggested most (64/84, 76%) students responded within 5 minutes of patient deterioration. Conclusions A multifaceted approach was effective to influence knowledge of septic shock over time and demonstrate students' ability to intervene with a septic shock patient in a timely manner.

Abstract: Child maltreatment has serious short and long-term negative impacts for those experiencing it. Child maltreatment occurring in institutional settings has recently received substantial attention. However, evidence about the effectiveness of interventions that prevent, disclose, respond to, or treat maltreatment that has occurred in these environments is fragmented and can be difficult to access. This evidence and gap map (EGM) collates this research evidence. It was developed as a resource for stakeholders operating in the child health, welfare and protection sectors, including practitioners, organisational leaders, policy developers and researchers, wanting to access high quality evidence on interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment. Background Child maltreatment has serious short and long-term negative impacts for those experiencing it. Child maltreatment occurring in institutional settings has recently received substantial attention. However, evidence about the effectiveness of interventions that prevent, disclose, respond to, or treat maltreatment that has occurred in these environments is fragmented and can be difficult to access. This evidence and gap map (EGM) collates this research evidence. It was developed as a resource for stakeholders operating in the child health, welfare and protection sectors, including practitioners, organisational leaders, policy developers and researchers, wanting to access high quality evidence on interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment.The objectives of this EGM were twofold: (a) To provide a structured and accessible collection of existing evidence from finalised and ongoing overviews of systematic reviews, systematic reviews and effectiveness studies of interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment-for those who work to fund, develop, implement and evaluate interventions aimed at ensuring children's safety in institutional settings; (b) to identify gaps in the available evidence on interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment-thereby helping to inform the research agendas of funders and other organisations. Objectives The objectives of this EGM were twofold: (a) To provide a structured and accessible collection of existing evidence from finalised and ongoing overviews of systematic reviews, systematic reviews and effectiveness studies of interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment-for those who work to fund, develop, implement and evaluate interventions aimed at ensuring children's safety in institutional settings; (b) to identify gaps in the available evidence on interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment-thereby helping to inform the research agendas of funders and other organisations.A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies from published and grey literature, comprising: (1) 10 electronic academic databases; (2) five trial and systematic review registries; (3) nine organisational websites; (4) websites and reference lists of inquiry reports associated with seven international inquiries into child abuse and (4) the lists of included studies within systematic reviews identified by the search strategy. Members of this EGM's Subject Matter Experts group were also invited to forward relevant unpublished studies or grey literature. Search Methods A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies from published and grey literature, comprising: (1) 10 electronic academic databases; (2) five trial and systematic review registries; (3) nine organisational websites; (4) websites and reference lists of inquiry reports associated with seven international inquiries into child abuse and (4) the lists of included studies within systematic reviews identified by the search strategy. Members of this EGM's Subject Matter Experts group were also invited to forward relevant unpublished studies or grey literature.The selection criteria were developed to identify finalised and ongoing overviews of reviews, systematic reviews and primary studies that reported on the effectiveness of interventions addressing child maltreatment (including sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect and emotional abuse) within institutional settings. Eligible effectiveness study designs included: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and quasi-experimental studies. Reviews were eligible if they reported a systematic literature search strategy. Selection Criteria The selection criteria were developed to identify finalised and ongoing overviews of reviews, systematic reviews and primary studies that reported on the effectiveness of interventions addressing child maltreatment (including sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect and emotional abuse) within institutional settings. Eligible effectiveness study designs included: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and quasi-experimental studies. Reviews were eligible if they reported a systematic literature search strategy.All screening, data extraction, coding and critical appraisals were undertaken by two or more reviewers working independently, with discrepancies resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer. The titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were screened, and each full text of potentially relevant studies was further assessed for inclusion. Key data were extracted from all included studies and reviews. This included information about: publication details (e.g., year, author, country), inclusion/exclusion criteria (for reviews), study design, institutional setting, target population, type of maltreatment, intervention type and outcomes. Critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was achieved using the AMSTAR 2 tool, and completed RCTs were assessed using the updated Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Data Collection and Analysis All screening, data extraction, coding and critical appraisals were undertaken by two or more reviewers working independently, with discrepancies resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer. The titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were screened, and each full text of potentially relevant studies was further assessed for inclusion. Key data were extracted from all included studies and reviews. This included information about: publication details (e.g., year, author, country), inclusion/exclusion criteria (for reviews), study design, institutional setting, target population, type of maltreatment, intervention type and outcomes. Critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was achieved using the AMSTAR 2 tool, and completed RCTs were assessed using the updated Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Number of studies The electronic database search yielded 6318 citations, and a further 2375 records were identified from additional sources. Following deduplication and title/abstract screening, 256 studies remained for full text review. A total of 73 eligible studies (reported across 84 publications) met the inclusion criteria, including: 11 systematic reviews (plus, one update); 62 primary studies (including, three protocols for primary studies). Study characteristics The studies were conducted across 18 countries, however more than half (52%) were undertaken in the United States. Overall, most studies evaluated curriculum-based interventions delivered in educational settings, primarily aimed at the prevention of sexual abuse. Institutional setting: Most studies evaluated interventions in school or early learning environments ( n  = 8 systematic reviews; n  = 58 primary studies). Far fewer studies examined other organisational settings. Out of home care (including foster care, residential care and orphanages), and social service organisations servicing children were minimally represented. No studies were identified where the primary setting was sports clubs, churches/religious organisations, summer/vacation camps, detention centres/juvenile justice settings, or primary/secondary health care facilities. Target population: Most interventions targeted children rather than adults ( n  = 7 systematic reviews; n  = 47 primary studies) from the general population. Fewer studies included populations known to be at an increased risk, or those already exposed to maltreatment. Just over a third of the primary studies conducted an analysis to ascertain differences in the effect of an intervention between the genders. Intervention type: Prevention interventions were the most studied ( n  = 5 systematic reviews; n  = 57 primary studies), with additional studies including prevention approaches alongside other intervention types. Fewer studies evaluated interventions targeting disclosure, institutional responses, or treatment interventions. Type of maltreatment: The vast majority of the studies assessed interventions solely addressing the sexual abuse of children ( n  = 8 systematic reviews; n  = 45 primary studies). The remaining studies addressed other forms of maltreatment, including physical and emotional abuse, or neglect, either in combination or as a sole focus. Outcomes: Primary reported outcomes reflected the bias toward child targeted interventions. Outcome measures captured child wellbeing and knowledge outcomes, including measures of mental health, children's knowledge retention and/or self-protective skills. Measures of maltreatment disclosure or maltreatment occurrence/reoccurrence were less common, and all other outcome categories included in the EGM were minimally or not reported. A third of studies reported on some measure of implementation. Study quality The overall quality of the studies was low to moderate. Most systematic reviews were low-quality ( n  = 10), with only one high quality review (and update) identified. Most completed RCTs had some concerns relating to the risk of bias ( n  = 30), and the remainder were considered to be at a high risk of bias ( n  = 19).

The current evidence base does not represent countries with large populations and the greatest incidence of child maltreatment. Few studies focussed on perpetrators or the organisational environment. Further evidence gaps were identified for interventions relating to disclosure, organisational responses and treatment, and few studies assessed interventions targeting perpetrators' maltreatment behaviours, recidivism or desistence. Future studies should also include measure of programme implementation.

Abstract: This phenomenological study aimed to explore a group of classroom teachers’ experiences with homework assignment in teaching mathematics. The participants of the study were 27 classroom teachers who were selected using the criterion-based sampling technique. The research data were collected with a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers and subjected to interpretive phenomenological analysis. The results showed that the teachers plan the homework they would assign the evening before the class and use resources available on the internet while planning it. It was also revealed that they assign mathematics homework for various purposes such as ensuring comprehension of the subjects, knowledge retention and use of the learned subjects in daily life. They reported that they check and provide feedback on the assigned homework during the classes that the assigned homework is sometimes done by the family members of the students and that both preparing and checking the homework take an extensive amount of time. As a solution to these problems, they suggested communicating and negotiating with the parents, getting support from school counselors and reducing the number of the themes in the primary mathematics curriculum.

Abstract: Background Child maltreatment has serious short and long-term negative impacts for those experiencing it. Child maltreatment occurring in institutional settings has recently received substantial attention. However, evidence about the effectiveness of interventions that prevent, disclose, respond to, or treat maltreatment that has occurred in these environments is fragmented and can be difficult to access. This evidence and gap map (EGM) collates this research evidence. It was developed as a resource for stakeholders operating in the child health, welfare and protection sectors, including practitioners, organisational leaders, policy developers and researchers, wanting to access high quality evidence on interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment. Objectives The objectives of this EGM were twofold: (a) To provide a structured and accessible collection of existing evidence from finalised and ongoing overviews of systematic reviews, systematic reviews and effectiveness studies of interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment—for those who work to fund, develop, implement and evaluate interventions aimed at ensuring children's safety in institutional settings; (b) to identify gaps in the available evidence on interventions addressing institutional child maltreatment—thereby helping to inform the research agendas of funders and other organisations. Search Methods A comprehensive search strategy identified relevant studies from published and grey literature, comprising: (1) 10 electronic academic databases; (2) five trial and systematic review registries; (3) nine organisational websites; (4) websites and reference lists of inquiry reports associated with seven international inquiries into child abuse and (4) the lists of included studies within systematic reviews identified by the search strategy. Members of this EGM's Subject Matter Experts group were also invited to forward relevant unpublished studies or grey literature. Selection Criteria The selection criteria were developed to identify finalised and ongoing overviews of reviews, systematic reviews and primary studies that reported on the effectiveness of interventions addressing child maltreatment (including sexual abuse, physical abuse, neglect and emotional abuse) within institutional settings. Eligible effectiveness study designs included: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomised trials, controlled before-and-after studies and quasi-experimental studies. Reviews were eligible if they reported a systematic literature search strategy. Data Collection and Analysis All screening, data extraction, coding and critical appraisals were undertaken by two or more reviewers working independently, with discrepancies resolved via consensus or by a third reviewer. The titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy were screened, and each full text of potentially relevant studies was further assessed for inclusion. Key data were extracted from all included studies and reviews. This included information about: publication details (e.g., year, author, country), inclusion/exclusion criteria (for reviews), study design, institutional setting, target population, type of maltreatment, intervention type and outcomes. Critical appraisal of included systematic reviews was achieved using the AMSTAR 2 tool, and completed RCTs were assessed using the updated Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Main Results Number of studies The electronic database search yielded 6318 citations, and a further 2375 records were identified from additional sources. Following deduplication and title/abstract screening, 256 studies remained for full text review. A total of 73 eligible studies (reported across 84 publications) met the inclusion criteria, including: 11 systematic reviews (plus, one update); 62 primary studies (including, three protocols for primary studies).

Abstract: Aiming at the problems existing in traditional methods such as poor destructibility, low knowledge processing capacity and easy loss of product innovation weighted knowledge, a collaborative product innovation weighted knowledge hypernetwork model based on adjacency matrix was designed. A knowledge sharing network model is established, which is used to transform product design tasks and form multiple sub-tasks. Acquire knowledge points and carry out network modelling, acquire the membership relationship between knowledge points, design individual knowledge subgraphs, and represent different knowledge subgraphs through adjacency matrix. The hypernetwork model is constructed, and the model is used to calculate knowledge points and relevant weights of knowledge, and the knowledge fusion is realised based on the calculation results, so as to realise the construction of knowledge hypernetwork model. The results show the maximum destruction resistance coefficient of the model is about 0.8, and the maximum product innovation weighted knowledge loss rate is only 15.2%.

Abstract: Rates of bystander CPR are increasing, yet mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains high. The aim of this survey was to explore public knowledge and attitudes to CPR. Our hypotheses were that recent CPR training (< 5 years) would be associated with a high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, and associated with an interest to become a smartphone app responder in suspected OHCA. AIM OF THE STUDY Rates of bystander CPR are increasing, yet mortality after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains high. The aim of this survey was to explore public knowledge and attitudes to CPR. Our hypotheses were that recent CPR training (< 5 years) would be associated with a high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, and associated with an interest to become a smartphone app responder in suspected OHCA.Data were collected through a web survey. Respondents (≥18 years) in Skåne County, Sweden were members of a panel created by a market research company. Data were weighted with respect to gender, age, municipalities and level of education to increase generalisability to the general population. METHODS Data were collected through a web survey. Respondents (≥18 years) in Skåne County, Sweden were members of a panel created by a market research company. Data were weighted with respect to gender, age, municipalities and level of education to increase generalisability to the general population.A total of 1060 eligible answers were analysed. Seventy-six percent of non-healthcare professionals (n = 912) had participated in a CPR course at some time in life, 58 percent during the previous five years. The recommended CPR algorithm was known by 57 percent, whereas knowledge of the location of the nearest automated external defibrillator (AED) in a home environment was poor. Recent CPR training (< 5 years) did not favour high-quality response in a case vignette of OHCA with agonal breathing, but was one predictor of wanting to become a smartphone app responder.

The potential to recruit smartphone app responders seems promising in certain groups. CONCLUSION This study highlights possible areas of improvement in CPR training, which might improve OHCA identification and facilitate knowledge retention. The potential to recruit smartphone app responders seems promising in certain groups.

Surprise, Surprise: KK Is Innocent

Abstract: The "surprise exam paradox" is well known: a teacher announces that there will be a surprise exam the following week; the students argue by an intuitively sound reasoning that this is impossible; and yet they can be surprised by the teacher. We suggest that a solution can be found scattered in the literature, in part anticipated by Wright and Sudbury, informally developed by Sorensen, and more recently discussed, and dismissed, by Williamson. In a nutshell, the solution consists in realising that the teacher's announcement is a blind spot that can only be known if the week is at least two days long. Along the way, we criticise Williamson's own treatment of the paradox. In Williamson's view, the surprise is similar to the paradox of the glimpse and, because of their similarities, both these paradoxes ought to receive a uniform treatment--one that involves locating an illicit application of the KK principle. We argue that there's no deep analogy between the surprise and the glimpse and that, even if there were, the surprise reasoning reaches a paradoxical conclusion before the KK principle is used. Rather, in both the surprise and the glimpse, the blame should be put on other epistemic principles--respectively, a knowledge retention and a margin for error principle. (edited)

Abstract: Dermoscopy aids in skin cancer identification. For family physicians who use dermoscopy, there is higher sensitivity for melanoma detection than naked-eye examination. There is a shortage of dermoscopy training for primary care providers. The triage amalgamated dermoscopic algorithm (TADA) is designed for novice dermoscopists. While TADA can be taught in a short dermoscopy workshop, spaced review and blended learning strategies improve knowledge retention. BACKGROUND Dermoscopy aids in skin cancer identification. For family physicians who use dermoscopy, there is higher sensitivity for melanoma detection than naked-eye examination. There is a shortage of dermoscopy training for primary care providers. The triage amalgamated dermoscopic algorithm (TADA) is designed for novice dermoscopists. While TADA can be taught in a short dermoscopy workshop, spaced review and blended learning strategies improve knowledge retention.This study determined the impact that the addition of a distance learning platform has on clinical dermoscopy use. Moreover, it evaluated dermoscopic image identification (knowledge retention) following the addition of distance learning via Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) to a traditional TADA dermoscopy workshop. OBJECTIVES This study determined the impact that the addition of a distance learning platform has on clinical dermoscopy use. Moreover, it evaluated dermoscopic image identification (knowledge retention) following the addition of distance learning via Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) to a traditional TADA dermoscopy workshop.Primary care providers voluntarily attended a 120-minute TADA dermoscopy workshop. Participants completed pre-intervention, post-TADA, and post-ECHO tests of 30 dermoscopic images of benign and malignant skin lesions. A survey was also administered to analyze clinical dermoscopy use and prior dermoscopy training. METHODS Primary care providers voluntarily attended a 120-minute TADA dermoscopy workshop. Participants completed pre-intervention, post-TADA, and post-ECHO tests of 30 dermoscopic images of benign and malignant skin lesions. A survey was also administered to analyze clinical dermoscopy use and prior dermoscopy training.Twenty-seven residents, faculty, and advanced practice providers participated in this longitudinal observational cohort study. Mean test scores (out of 30) for images of benign and malignant lesions improved from 20.29 pre-intervention to 24.62 post-TADA and 27.63 post-ECHO (P < .001). On average, participants attended 4 ECHO sessions (out of 7 total) and there was a positive correlation ( r = 0.77) between the number of ECHOs attended and post-ECHO scores. Dermoscope use increased from 37.0% to 96.3% (P < .001). RESULTS Twenty-seven residents, faculty, and advanced practice providers participated in this longitudinal observational cohort study. Mean test scores (out of 30) for images of benign and malignant lesions improved from 20.29 pre-intervention to 24.62 post-TADA and 27.63 post-ECHO (P < .001). On average, participants attended 4 ECHO sessions (out of 7 total) and there was a positive correlation (r = 0.77) between the number of ECHOs attended and post-ECHO scores. Dermoscope use increased from 37.0% to 96.3% (P < .001).Distance learning and spaced review complement dermoscopy workshop training for primary care. CONCLUSION Distance learning and spaced review complement dermoscopy workshop training for primary care.

Abstract: Minority populations are increasingly diagnosed with skin cancer and often in later stages with more aggressive subtypes. BACKGROUND Minority populations are increasingly diagnosed with skin cancer and often in later stages with more aggressive subtypes.We sought to pilot a study to evaluate the effectiveness of providing a skin cancer screening and education module to address potential barriers to dermatologic care for an underserved population in New Haven, Connecticut. OBJECTIVE We sought to pilot a study to evaluate the effectiveness of providing a skin cancer screening and education module to address potential barriers to dermatologic care for an underserved population in New Haven, Connecticut.At a free clinic, voluntary adults (n = 24) waiting for a skin cancer screening were recruited and consented to participate. Participants completed a 16-question survey prior to the total body-skin examination and the educational module, as well as a survey after the examination. METHODS At a free clinic, voluntary adults (n = 24) waiting for a skin cancer screening were recruited and consented to participate. Participants completed a 16-question survey prior to the total body-skin examination and the educational module, as well as a survey after the examination.Most participants were uninsured (79%) and Hispanic (71%). Pre- and postintervention surveys indicated significant increases in knowledge, risk awareness, and confidence for self-screening. RESULTS Most participants were uninsured (79%) and Hispanic (71%). Pre- and postintervention surveys indicated significant increases in knowledge, risk awareness, and confidence for self-screening.This study establishes an effective public health education intervention to promote the prevention of skin cancer. A multicenter study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period to assess knowledge retention could further address limitations in this initial pilot study. CONCLUSION This study establishes an effective public health education intervention to promote the prevention of skin cancer. A multicenter study with a larger sample size and longer follow-up period to assess knowledge retention could further address limitations in this initial pilot study.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The Lean approach and practices are spread around the world and are gaining space in different areas such as public services and Higher Education. The Lean focus on eliminating waste may be applied in every organization, but it is essential to know the wastes and treat them to create value to final process users. Based on this, the objective of the paper is to propose a lean management framework applied to waste management in public higher education institutions (HEI) and to test it into the field. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology was utilized and applied in a Brazilian Higher Education Institution (HEI). The seven classical Lean manufacturing wastes plus the knowledge waste were taken to make a multi-criteria matrix composed of 24 wastes. The wastes were scored and categorized according to the answers of the directors and vice directors of the HEI studied. As the main result, this study proposes a waste management framework with examples to orientate managers as well as academic and service university staff about wastes. Also, the results demonstrate that loss of knowledge and over-processing wastes are the most relevant to be treated at the university campuses. The waste prioritization allows universities to organize their activities and select tools or practices to optimize their efforts to create value for final users. This study advances in the theoretical and practical field by showing a simple way to incorporate lean practices and values in public service organizations and HEI.

Abstract: This study examined how weekly, externally set deadlines affected the completion of adaptive learning assignments and student outcomes in an introductory macroeconomics course. We imposed different deadline schemes for the same adaptive learning assignments in two sections of the course. One section was given flexible deadlines and the other section was given rigid weekly deadlines. We found that weekly deadlines did not affect assignment completions or total points earned on unit exams. We investigated how the adaptive learning assignments affected student retention of material. A measure of staying on pace in the course provided a positive effect on the comprehensive final exam for students with weekly deadlines. The weekly deadlines may not have influenced assignment completions but consistent engagement with the flow of topics through the course increased student knowledge retention. Regardless of deadline type, completions of adaptive learning assignments positively affected outcomes on the unit exams and final exam.

Surprise, surprise: KK is innocent

Abstract: The Surprise Exam Paradox is well-known: a teacher announces that there will be a surprise exam the following week; the students argue by an intuitively sound reasoning that this is impossible; and yet they can be surprised by the teacher. We suggest that a solution can be found scattered in the literature, in part anticipated by Wright and Sudbury, informally developed by Sorensen, and more recently discussed, and dismissed, by Williamson. In a nutshell, the solution consists in realising that the teacher's announcement is a blindspot that can only be known if the week is at least 2 days long. Along the way, we criticise Williamson's own treatment of the paradox. In Williamson's view, the Surprise is similar to the Paradox of the Glimpse and, because of their similarities, both these paradoxes ought to receive a uniform treatment-one that involves locating an illicit application of the KK Principle. We argue that there's no deep analogy between the Surprise and the Glimpse and that, even if there were, the Surprise reasoning reaches a paradoxical conclusion before the KK Principle is used. Rather, in both the Surprise and the Glimpse, the blame should be put on other epistemic principles-respectively, a knowledge retention and a margin for error principle.The Surprise Exam Paradox is well-known: a teacher announces that there will be a surprise exam the following week; the students argue by an intuitively sound reasoning that this is impossible; and yet they can be surprised by the teacher.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Societal changes have prompted the elimination of Family and Consumer Science courses from many schools and the reduction of food-handler role models at home. Declining opportunities for youth to acquire food-handling knowledge and skills increases their risk of contracting a foodborne illness. Many youths are employed in food service and could perpetuate the spread of foodborne illness. In this study, two food safety curricula were evaluated for effectiveness in changing the food safety knowledge, risk-perception, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) of high school students enrolled in microbiology and agriculture courses, immediately following and one year after an educational intervention. One curriculum utilized the Positive Deviance (PD) model, while the other utilized Experiential Learning (EL) methods. Survey questions related to risk-perception and PCB were measured on a five-point Likert scale. Twenty-four knowledge questions were assigned one point for each correct answer and zero points for incorrect answers. Risk-perception and PBC continued to increase from the post-survey to the follow-up survey among the PD and EL Groups. After the educational intervention, the EL Group perceived themselves to be at a greater risk for contracting a foodborne illness and became significantly more confident in their abilities to clean food-contact surfaces, store food safely, and prepare food that is safe to eat. Knowledge scores also significantly increased among the PD (16.88–18.78) and EL (16.66–18.81) Groups. After one year, only the EL Group scored significantly higher on the follow-up survey (18.87) than on the pre-survey (16.66). Microbiology students achieved the highest knowledge scores (20.47) after the educational intervention; however, their knowledge gain significantly attenuated (19.39) after one year. Students reported sharing food safety information with family to improve food-handling behaviors. This study demonstrates the need for continued food safety education to retain knowledge and highlights the study's curricula continued influence on students' risk-perception and PBC.

Abstract: This study examined the relationships among KM (knowledge creation, sharing), professional development, therapy team’s (TT’s) operation modes, interaction modes and collaborative technologies’ use determinants. A sample survey research design and mixed methods approach that combined quantitative research methods guided the study. Quantitative data was collected from 283 therapy team members in two psychiatric hospitals in Nigeria using a self-administered questionnaire. SPSS version 22 and SPSS (AMOS) version 23 were used to analyse the data. Knowledge creation and knowledge sharing impacted significantly on professional development. Therapy team members’ Intellectual capability, increased innovation, disciplinary specialisation and professional learning are dependent on their creation and sharing of knowledge. Disciplinary socialisation, transdisciplinary socialisation, collaboration and communication summarise their day-to-day operations. Collaboration and knowledge creation and sharing have a very strong relationship. Working together with colleagues is directly related with creation and sharing of both tacit and explicit knowledge. Learning by practical experience, brainstorming of ideas, sharing of clinical information and best practice of medical profession are positively impacted by collaboration.

The effect of paper-based manual and stereoscopic-based mobile augmented reality systems on knowledge retention

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effect-paper-based-manual-stereoscopic-mobile/docview/2489906652/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Augmented reality technology is attracting increased attention, given the popularity of the smartphone. The utilisation of the smartphone with AR technology is also enabling mobile augmented reality (MAR) to become accessible. Stereoscopic vision offers users the benefit of depth perception, which can help improve user memory. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect on knowledge retention using MAR with stereoscopic vision. An experiment to compare a stereoscopic-based MAR application and a paper-based manual was designed to test the participants’ knowledge retention on a product part and disassembly process. The developed MAR adopted a smartphone and headset case to provide a stereoscopic view to the user. The experiment consisted of both pre-test and post-test phases where the pre-test phase examined the participant’s knowledge about the product, and the post-test phase focused on how much information the participants could recall. The post-test phase was conducted after 48 h following the pre-test phase since long-term memory required several hours in which to stabilise. The results showed that the MAR group had an advantage over the paper-based manual group for both information retentions having a mean score of 8.89 from the MAR group, compared with 6.33 for the paper-based manual group. Moreover, the MAR group was observed to have fewer errors in the post-test with a mean score of 0.53, whereas the paper-based achieved a score of 2.2. This result indicated that the MAR group and the paper-based manual group had equivalent performance in the completion time without the assistance tool. In addition, MAR had a better mean score for the subjective feedback (usefulness = 4.47, ease of use 4.18 and satisfaction = 4.07).

Abstract: This study examined how weekly, externally set deadlines affected the completion of adaptive learning assignments and student outcomes in an introductory macroeconomics course. We imposed different deadline schemes for the same adaptive learning assignments in two sections of the course. One section was given flexible deadlines and the other section was given rigid weekly deadlines. We found that weekly deadlines did not affect assignment completions or total points earned on unit exams. We investigated how the adaptive learning assignments affected student retention of material. A measure of staying on pace in the course provided a positive effect on the comprehensive final exam for students with weekly deadlines. The weekly deadlines may not have influenced assignment completions but consistent engagement with the flow of topics through the course increased student knowledge retention. Regardless of deadline type, completions of adaptive learning assignments positively affected outcomes on the unit exams and final exam. JEL Classifications : A20, A22

Abstract: Prelicensure nursing students lack the situational awareness to promote timely intervention with a patient in septic shock. This study evaluated a multifaceted educational project that determined the impact on nursing students' knowledge retention and time to task (TTT). BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Prelicensure nursing students lack the situational awareness to promote timely intervention with a patient in septic shock. This study evaluated a multifaceted educational project that determined the impact on nursing students' knowledge retention and time to task (TTT).A quasi-experimental, repeated-measures design was used to evaluate students' knowledge retention and TTT. Eighty-four prelicensure nursing students participated in groups of 4 students to participate in a high-fidelity simulation. METHODS A quasi-experimental, repeated-measures design was used to evaluate students' knowledge retention and TTT. Eighty-four prelicensure nursing students participated in groups of 4 students to participate in a high-fidelity simulation.Results show knowledge retention was significant between the pretest scores and 2 repeated assessment scores. The repeated-measures analysis of variance time effect P value was .02. The overall TTT group response suggested most (64/84, 76%) students responded within 5 minutes of patient deterioration. RESULTS Results show knowledge retention was significant between the pretest scores and 2 repeated assessment scores. The repeated-measures analysis of variance time effect P value was .02. The overall TTT group response suggested most (64/84, 76%) students responded within 5 minutes of patient deterioration.A multifaceted approach was effective to influence knowledge of septic shock over time and demonstrate students' ability to intervene with a septic shock patient in a timely manner. CONCLUSIONS A multifaceted approach was effective to influence knowledge of septic shock over time and demonstrate students' ability to intervene with a septic shock patient in a timely manner.

Abstract: Adolescents with epilepsy are a population with unique needs when addressing transition to adult care. Scheduled, non-emergent admissions to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) have not yet been utilized to improve transition education. BACKGROUND Adolescents with epilepsy are a population with unique needs when addressing transition to adult care. Scheduled, non-emergent admissions to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) have not yet been utilized to improve transition education.The overarching goal of this evidence-based practice project was to explore opportunities to enhance the transition education patients and families receive in the clinic setting by leveraging scheduled inpatient admissions for EEG monitoring to provide structured transition education. Twenty-one Neurology Clinic providers were surveyed about their perspectives on the transition process. Thirty-five adolescent patients (12-20 years old) received a pre-test regarding their condition, health maintenance and disease management, and a subsequent post-test measuring knowledge retention after education with a provider. Documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) using an institution created transition flowsheet and a standardized template was used to communicate through the EHR with the primary neurology team. METHODS The overarching goal of this evidence-based practice project was to explore opportunities to enhance the transition education patients and families receive in the clinic setting by leveraging scheduled inpatient admissions for EEG monitoring to provide structured transition education. Twenty-one Neurology Clinic providers were surveyed about their perspectives on the transition process. Thirty-five adolescent patients (12-20 years old) received a pre-test regarding their condition, health maintenance and disease management, and a subsequent post-test measuring knowledge retention after education with a provider. Documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) using an institution created transition flowsheet and a standardized template was used to communicate through the EHR with the primary neurology team.The effectiveness of the intervention was supported as 100% of patients demonstrated increased knowledge after transition education. Providers' knowledge and support of transition efforts increased regarding tools and guidelines for transition of adolescents to adult care. FINDINGS The effectiveness of the intervention was supported as 100% of patients demonstrated increased knowledge after transition education. Providers' knowledge and support of transition efforts increased regarding tools and guidelines for transition of adolescents to adult care.These results support the feasibility of providing transition education in the EMU with shared responsibility between inpatient and ambulatory providers. DISCUSSION These results support the feasibility of providing transition education in the EMU with shared responsibility between inpatient and ambulatory providers.Improved use of the transition flowsheet in the EMU and by ambulatory setting providers will enhance the process of transition. Discussion of self-management with adolescent patients during all phases of health care will encourage independence and promote successful transition to adult health care. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Improved use of the transition flowsheet in the EMU and by ambulatory setting providers will enhance the process of transition. Discussion of self-management with adolescent patients during all phases of health care will encourage independence and promote successful transition to adult health care.

Abstract: Online homework systems have been shown to help student achievement in chemistry courses. This study sought to compare the levels of knowledge retention in students over the course of a semester, using two different types of homework systems—the adaptive-responsive system and the traditional-responsive system. Two sections of a first semester general chemistry course were investigated, with one section using the adaptive-responsive system and the other using the traditional-responsive system. Students’ grades on cumulative exams were compared across both sections, and it was found that students using the adaptive-responsive system scored significantly higher on the exams and retained significantly more information than the students in the other section. The results of this study should help inform the choices educators make regarding the homework system they choose to use, or even which parts of the different systems they choose to use or not to use based on the outcomes they would like for their student population.

Abstract: The article presents a study aimed at creating awareness about nutrition and healthy lifestyles using an edutainment module called Nutritainment (nutrition education combined with entertainment). Herein, the development of Nutritainment module, its delivery and impact on the nutrition and lifestyle knowledge of 12−14- year-old adolescents are expounded. The topics covered in Nutritainment were based on the dietary guidelines for Indian adolescents and topics covered in the school curricula prescribed by the Central Board of Secondary Education, India. The topics covered in the Nutritainment module were essentially from those covered in the school curricula, and this study shows that the edutainment approach has a great potential to complement the conventional teaching and thus supplement the inadequacies of curriculum-oriented nutrition education. This is in alignment with the recently introduced National Education Policy 2020 of India, which emphasizes effective techniques in pedagogy and learner-centered and collaborative learning methods. Therefore, they can be adapted with tailor-made, age-specific contents for various age groups of student audiences. Nevertheless, knowledge gain does not always guarantee behavior change; and therefore, a prospective case control study needs to be performed to assess its impact on knowledge retention and behavioral change among adolescents. In addition, the small sample size was a limitation, and therefore, the outcomes may not be generalizable. However, a short-term professional course in nutrition education delivery methods for teachers may help complement the current pedagogies that they use.

Abstract: Expanding frontiers of knowledge have prompted medical schools to reconsider how best to promote learning in the face of information overload. Concept mapping (CM) promotes knowledge retention and integration. Students have perceived CM positively in prior studies, but the feasibility and utility of integrating CM into a medical student oncology curriculum as a learning and assessment tool have not been described. At the University of California, San Francisco, 152 medical students in a second-year hematology/oncology course produced concept maps about a single cancer type over 4 weeks. We collected student evaluations about CM. Two of three graders independently scored each map using a standard rubric. We compared CM scores with USMLE Step 1 scores and clerkship grades using regression. All students produced a concept map. Student perception was mixed, and students provided feedback to improve CM utility as a learning tool. Grading was feasible, and inter-rater reliability was high. CM scores did not predict USMLE Step 1 scores or clerkship grades. CM was feasible as a learning tool, and we present strategies based on student feedback and literature review to improve utility. CM was feasible and reliable as an assessment tool; additional validity evidence may improve utility. Future studies should explore whether CM integrated into medical student oncology curricula early, serially, and collaboratively, with iterative practice and feedback, may predict meaningful learning and performance outcomes.

Abstract: Today the industry is facing a shortage of skilled workers and an aging workforce, which will eventually lead to a loss of knowledge. But augmented reality technology can connect field workers with experts who are able to provide remote guidance in real time. The subsequent advantage is that the information obtained by AR devices can be used as accumulated successful experience in the future, which facilitates decision-making in specific business processes of the company. With AR, employees gain experience and skills much faster. This paper shows the application of augmented reality technology in the maintenance of electromechanical equipment. The main functions of the augmented reality system for servicing electrical equipment are presented, the solution to the problem of integrating an augmented reality software application with existing automation systems is shown, and the methods of interaction of the developed software module with third-party modules, for example, various analytical modules, etc. are described.

Abstract: In practice, there is a massive time lag between data loss and its cause identification. The existing techniques perform it comprehensively, but they consume too much time, so there is a need for fast and reliable methods. The article’s purpose is to develop a rapid methodology to assess the risk of information and knowledge loss management. It provides the implementation of eight steps and combines a risk mapping method modified by assessments based on risk factors and incidents as elements from set theory and using formalization via binary estimates. The methodology includes five significant events caused by the company staff, technical problems, software, cybercriminals, viral attacks, and 66 factors influencing company incidents. As a result, a risk map of 9 groups was built for a Ukrainian enterprise. Only two groups with the minimum number of incidents and low losses are represented by all five incidents. The defined overall level of each risk group ranges from 0.14 to 0.26, which indicates a low probability of all happenings in the group. In general, the resulting map shows the existence of specific security problems of the company under investigation. The proposed assessment allows us to interpret the level of risk in the company quickly, identify weaknesses in the information security system, and predict future losses.

To share or not to share: A social-cognitive internalization model to explain how age discrimination impairs older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues

Abstract: Older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues is pivotal for organizational knowledge retention. We developed a social-cognitive internalization model that explains why older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues is often inhibited. Specifically, we focused on perceived age discrimination at work as a threat to older employees’ perceptions of their job-related capabilities (i.e., occupational self-efficacy), which in turn reduces older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues. Study 1, a field study with 100 age-diverse employee dyads provided support for our framework. Older employees who perceived age discrimination showed lower occupational self-efficacy, which predicted less knowledge sharing with younger colleagues. To help organizations address this challenge, we extended our theorizing by considering organizational context and hypothesized supportive effects of the availability of age-specific HR practices (i.e., HR development and HR accommodation activities). We replicated the first study’s findings in Study 2 using a three-wave survey with 472 older employees. Additionally, we found that HR accommodation practices strengthened the positive relation between occupational self-efficacy and knowledge sharing. Hence, HR accommodation practices constitute a double-edged sword: They helped older employees with higher occupational self-efficacy but impair knowledge sharing by older employees with lower occupational self-efficacy resulting from perceived age discrimination.

Abstract: Expanding frontiers of knowledge have prompted medical schools to reconsider how best to promote learning in the face of information overload. Concept mapping (CM) promotes knowledge retention and integration. Students have perceived CM positively in prior studies, but the feasibility and utility of integrating CM into a medical student oncology curriculum as a learning and assessment tool have not been described. At the University of California, San Francisco, 152 medical students in a second-year hematology/oncology course produced concept maps about a single cancer type over 4 weeks. We collected student evaluations about CM. Two of three graders independently scored each map using a standard rubric. We compared CM scores with USMLE Step 1 scores and clerkship grades using regression. All students produced a concept map. Student perception was mixed, and students provided feedback to improve CM utility as a learning tool. Grading was feasible, and inter-rater reliability was high. CM scores did not predict USMLE Step 1 scores or clerkship grades. CM was feasible as a learning tool, and we present strategies based on student feedback and literature review to improve utility. CM was feasible and reliable as an assessment tool; additional validity evidence may improve utility. Future studies should explore whether CM integrated into medical student oncology curricula early, serially, and collaboratively, with iterative practice and feedback, may predict meaningful learning and performance outcomes.

Abstract: Sustainability challenges are complex and call for the effective development of knowledge, skills, and abilities in current and new leaders. New offerings in higher education provide sustainability training to complement studies in geography, engineering, science, and other disciplines, in many cases including innovative experiential learning components – including the use of reflection. Although reflection in education is not a new concept, how to assess reflection has remained challenging. Recent research on the Reflective Learning Framework (RLF) aims to address many of the challenges associated with guiding, assessing, and evaluating student learning through reflections. The objective of this research was to investigate the perceptions of students who use the RLF about their experience using reflection in a sustainability course. Semi-structured interviews with students provide a valuable perspective on the use of reflection. Particularly, findings from this research indicate that students see reflection as a tool to develop and use cognitive and metacognitive skills, and also as a tool to support knowledge retention and transfer. Accordingly, student perspectives on reflection show that this practice contributes to the acquisition of higher-order thinking skills required to address the complex challenges of sustainability.

Abstract: Online homework systems have been shown to help student achievement in chemistry courses. This study sought to compare the levels of knowledge retention in students over the course of a semester, using two different types of homework systems—the adaptive-responsive system and the traditional-responsive system. Two sections of a first semester general chemistry course were investigated, with one section using the adaptive-responsive system and the other using the traditional-responsive system. Students’ grades on cumulative exams were compared across both sections, and it was found that students using the adaptive-responsive system scored significantly higher on the exams and retained significantly more information than the students in the other section. The results of this study should help inform the choices educators make regarding the homework system they choose to use, or even which parts of the different systems they choose to use or not to use based on the outcomes they would like for their student population.

Abstract: Increasingly, evidence supports the use of educational paradigms that focus on teacher-learner interaction and learner engagement. We redesigned our monthly obstetric anesthesia resident didactics from a lecture-based curriculum to an interactive format including problem-based learning, case discussion, question/answer sessions, and simulation. We hypothesized that the new curriculum would improve resident satisfaction with the educational experience, satisfaction with the rotation, and knowledge retention. BACKGROUND Increasingly, evidence supports the use of educational paradigms that focus on teacher-learner interaction and learner engagement. We redesigned our monthly obstetric anesthesia resident didactics from a lecture-based curriculum to an interactive format including problem-based learning, case discussion, question/answer sessions, and simulation. We hypothesized that the new curriculum would improve resident satisfaction with the educational experience, satisfaction with the rotation, and knowledge retention.Fifty-three anesthesiology residents were prospectively recruited and quasi-randomized through an alternating-month pattern to attend either interactive sessions or traditional lectures. Residents completed a daily satisfaction survey about quality of teaching sessions and a comprehensive satisfaction survey at the conclusion of the rotation. Knowledge retention was assessed with a knowledge test completed on the final day. The primary outcome was daily satisfaction with the curriculum, and secondary outcomes included overall satisfaction with the curriculum, overall rotation satisfaction, and within-resident difference between pre- and post-knowledge test scores. METHODS Fifty-three anesthesiology residents were prospectively recruited and quasi-randomized through an alternating-month pattern to attend either interactive sessions or traditional lectures. Residents completed a daily satisfaction survey about quality of teaching sessions and a comprehensive satisfaction survey at the conclusion of the rotation. Knowledge retention was assessed with a knowledge test completed on the final day. The primary outcome was daily satisfaction with the curriculum, and secondary outcomes included overall satisfaction with the curriculum, overall rotation satisfaction, and within-resident difference between pre- and post-knowledge test scores.No differences were observed in daily resident satisfaction after interactive sessions vs traditional lectures. Furthermore, no differences were observed between the interactive sessions and traditional lecture groups in overall satisfaction with the curriculum, overall satisfaction with the entire rotation or within-resident difference between pre- and post-knowledge test scores. RESULTS No differences were observed in daily resident satisfaction after interactive sessions vs traditional lectures. Furthermore, no differences were observed between the interactive sessions and traditional lecture groups in overall satisfaction with the curriculum, overall satisfaction with the entire rotation or within-resident difference between pre- and post-knowledge test scores.Our study failed to demonstrate improvement in resident satisfaction or knowledge retention following implementation of an interactive curriculum on a month-long obstetric anesthesia rotation. Reasons may include misalignment of the intervention with measured study outcomes, lack of sensitivity of the survey tools, and inadequate training of faculty presenters. CONCLUSIONS Our study failed to demonstrate improvement in resident satisfaction or knowledge retention following implementation of an interactive curriculum on a month-long obstetric anesthesia rotation. Reasons may include misalignment of the intervention with measured study outcomes, lack of sensitivity of the survey tools, and inadequate training of faculty presenters.

Abstract: Older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues is pivotal for organizational knowledge retention. We developed a social-cognitive internalization model that explains why older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues is often inhibited. Specifically, we focused on perceived age discrimination at work as a threat to older employees’ perceptions of their job-related capabilities (i.e., occupational self-efficacy), which in turn reduces older employees’ knowledge sharing with younger colleagues. Study 1, a field study with 100 age-diverse employee dyads provided support for our framework. Older employees who perceived age discrimination showed lower occupational self-efficacy, which predicted less knowledge sharing with younger colleagues. To help organizations address this challenge, we extended our theorizing by considering organizational context and hypothesized supportive effects of the availability of age-specific HR practices (i.e., HR development and HR accommodation activities). We replicated the first study’s findings in Study 2 using a three-wave survey with 472 older employees. Additionally, we found that HR accommodation practices strengthened the positive relation between occupational self-efficacy and knowledge sharing. Hence, HR accommodation practices constitute a double-edged sword: They helped older employees with higher occupational self-efficacy but impair knowledge sharing by older employees with lower occupational self-efficacy resulting from perceived age discrimination.

Abstract: As new technologies are incorporated into the practice of veterinary medicine, it is imperative we utilize the most effective and impactful content delivery methods. Ultrasound technology has become more affordable and compact for veterinary hospitals, leading to easier incorporation into practice. This study compares three methods of delivering ultrasound knobology content to first-year veterinary students at Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. In a prospective study, first-year veterinary students were randomly selected to receive one of three content delivery methods: self-directed active learning (SDL), in-person instructor demonstration, or online module instruction. Knowledge acquisition was assessed using a 10-question quiz for short-term understanding followed by a 10-question quiz after a 6-week period to assess long-term knowledge retention. Student demographics were analyzed using the Chi-square test. Quiz scores were analyzed between groups using Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Dunn's post-tests for multiple comparisons. Values of p ≤ .05 were considered significant. On the short-term and retention quiz questions, students participating in SDL scored significantly higher (10 [5-10]) than those receiving in-person instructor demonstration (9 [3-10] p = .01 and 8 [2-10] p = .0004, respectively) or the online module instruction training (Group C) (6 [1-10] p < 0.0001 and 8 [4-10] p < .001, respectively). Based on quiz scores, veterinary students exhibited better ultrasound knobology and image quality recognition proficiency immediately and at 6-weeks following SDL when compared with other content delivery methods. Self-directed learning methods are recommended when teaching ultrasonography to veterinary students.As new technologies are incorporated into the practice of veterinary medicine, it is imperative we utilize the most effective and impactful content delivery methods.

Abstract: Expanding frontiers of knowledge have prompted medical schools to reconsider how best to promote learning in the face of information overload. Concept mapping (CM) promotes knowledge retention and integration. Students have perceived CM positively in prior studies, but the feasibility and utility of integrating CM into a medical student oncology curriculum as a learning and assessment tool have not been described. At the University of California, San Francisco, 152 medical students in a second-year hematology/oncology course produced concept maps about a single cancer type over 4 weeks. We collected student evaluations about CM. Two of three graders independently scored each map using a standard rubric. We compared CM scores with USMLE Step 1 scores and clerkship grades using regression. All students produced a concept map. Student perception was mixed, and students provided feedback to improve CM utility as a learning tool. Grading was feasible, and inter-rater reliability was high. CM scores did not predict USMLE Step 1 scores or clerkship grades. CM was feasible as a learning tool, and we present strategies based on student feedback and literature review to improve utility. CM was feasible and reliable as an assessment tool; additional validity evidence may improve utility. Future studies should explore whether CM integrated into medical student oncology curricula early, serially, and collaboratively, with iterative practice and feedback, may predict meaningful learning and performance outcomes.Expanding frontiers of knowledge have prompted medical schools to reconsider how best to promote learning in the face of information overload.

Abstract: Bite-sized learning is an instructional method that utilizes brief, focused learning units. This approach may be beneficial in medical education given demands on learner time and cognitive load. This study aims to assess the impact of this approach on knowledge acquisition and learner attitudes in postgraduate medical education. CONTEXT Bite-sized learning is an instructional method that utilizes brief, focused learning units. This approach may be beneficial in medical education given demands on learner time and cognitive load. This study aims to assess the impact of this approach on knowledge acquisition and learner attitudes in postgraduate medical education.An instructional method, termed Bite-Sized Teaching (BST), was implemented within the curriculum at a US Internal Medicine postgraduate training program. In BST, content is distilled into manageable units focused on relevant schemas and delivered via brief peer teaching. A two-fold assessment of BST was performed that included cross sectional survey to assess learner attitudes and experiences and a controlled study to assess knowledge acquisition with BST and case-based teaching control. METHODS An instructional method, termed Bite-Sized Teaching (BST), was implemented within the curriculum at a US Internal Medicine postgraduate training program. In BST, content is distilled into manageable units focused on relevant schemas and delivered via brief peer teaching. A two-fold assessment of BST was performed that included cross sectional survey to assess learner attitudes and experiences and a controlled study to assess knowledge acquisition with BST and case-based teaching control.One hundred and six of 171 residents (62% response rate) completed the survey. Most residents (79.8%) reported BST was among the best conference types in the curriculum. Important components of BST cited by residents include the distilled content, multiple short talk format and peer teaching. Residents report incorporating what they learned via BST into their teaching (76.1%) and clinical practice (74.1%). Resident who had participated as speaker were significantly more likely to report incorporating learning from BST into their teaching (87.2% vs 63.0%, p < 0.01, Cramer's V effect size = 0.37) and clinical practice (89.7% vs 65.3%, p = 0.02, Cramer's V effect size 0.28). Fifty-one residents participated in the knowledge assessment. Residents taught via BST scored significantly higher on immediate post-test compared to case-based teaching (score [SE] 62.5% [1.9] vs 55.2% [2.4], p = 0.03, Hedges g effect size 0.66). While both groups improved over pretest, there was no significant difference in scores between BST and case-based teaching at two (score [SE] 57.1 [2.1] vs 54.8 [2.5], p = 0.54) and six weeks (score [SD] 55.9 [2.1] vs 53.0 [2.9], p = 0.43). RESULTS One hundred and six of 171 residents (62% response rate) completed the survey. Most residents (79.8%) reported BST was among the best conference types in the curriculum. Important components of BST cited by residents include the distilled content, multiple short talk format and peer teaching. Residents report incorporating what they learned via BST into their teaching (76.1%) and clinical practice (74.1%).

Further study on long term knowledge retention and behaviors is needed. Bite-Sized Teaching may be a promising instructional approach in medical education. CONCLUSIONS Teaching via brief, focused learning units delivered by peers is well received by learners and appears to have a significantly greater impact on immediate knowledge recall than case-based teaching. Further study on long term knowledge retention and behaviors is needed. Bite-Sized Teaching may be a promising instructional approach in medical education.

Abstract: State-owned enterprises (SOEs) play a significant role in the South African economy and are the key drivers for delivering on the country’s developmental mandate. Nevertheless, many SOEs are facing a phenomenon of organisational knowledge loss caused largely by an attrition of their much-needed firm-specific human resources through voluntary and involuntary turnover and a lack of retention strategies. Human resource management (HRM) departments in state-owned enterprises are failing to play their role in the knowledge management (KM) agenda despite being the custodians of firm-specific human resources. In any company, organisational tacit knowledge, as a source of sustained competitive advantage, is contingent on human resources. In SOEs, employees are sources of such knowledge. In many SOEs, this problem of organisational knowledge loss is exacerbated by a lack of knowledge management practices, the absence of organisational structures and roles dedicated to knowledge management, a silo mentality and red tape. The purpose of the study was to develop a framework on knowledge loss reduction that integrates knowledge management and human resource management practices in the South African state-owned enterprises. This study followed a mixed methods research approach by using an exploratory sequential design. A qualitative phase was conducted first (through the interviews and document analysis of annual reports), while in the second, and quantitative phase, a survey questionnaire was used to test the knowledge and research findings revealed by the qualitative phase. The qualitative data were collected from nine SOEs in five market sectors through the use of interviews with twenty purposively selected HR managers. The data collection phase also included the analysis of annual reports. The research findings of the qualitative phase were used to develop a survey questionnaire for testing in the quantitative phase. The survey questionnaire that was used to collect data in the second phase of the study, was distributed to 585 employees and KM practitioners in the SOE sector and had a response rate of 25%. The study revealed that the majority of the SOEs lacked dedicated KM functions and roles in their organisational structures. The study also established that there was a serious lack of synergy between the HRM and KM practices of the few SOEs that had dedicated knowledge management function and roles in the structures. A lack of key strategies for managing and reducing organisational knowledge loss contributed to knowledge stickiness and reduced knowledge protective capacity. However, on a positive note, recruitment and training practices were found to be effective in the sourcing and development of firm-specific human and knowledge resources. Despite their shortcomings, these two practices played an important role in capacitating knowledge creation and acquisition, thus boosting knowledge-absorptive capacity in the SOEs. Nonetheless, the same cannot be said of the human resource retention practices. The study recommends that HRM practices be aligned and integrated into KM for effective management and reduction of organisational knowledge loss. Furthermore, HRM practitioners should develop and lead strategies aimed at embedding a knowledge-centric organisational culture, structures and processes to ensure that knowledge management is fully institutionalised. In this regard, knowledge-oriented leadership is required across all levels of organisations. The study offers a framework for knowledge loss reduction as a baseline to assist SOEs with integrating their HRM and KM practices in order to reduce the dire risks associated with losing much-needed, firm-specific human and knowledge resources.

Abstract: In the nursing profession, knowledge retention is aimed at retaining ownership and recognising the importance of critical nursing knowledge across all healthcare organisations. In Philadelphia Hospital, like many other healthcare organisations in South Africa, knowledge retention is hardly understood, practiced, and implemented in the nursing profession. The challenge of losing critical nursing knowledge in healthcare organisations has resulted in the occurrence of countless medical blunders, misdiagnosis and erroneous treatments leading to multiple drug resistant diseases and unpredicted deaths. The purpose of the study was to develop a knowledge retention strategy for professional nurses with the views to retain critical nursing knowledge that is vulnerable to loss when professional nurses leave the organisations through a variety of employee attrition factors. The study adopted a qualitative research approach and a case-study research design in which interview guides were used to solicit data from participants. Out of 90 professional nurses, 20 professional nurses were interviewed to a point of saturation. Data collected were analysed by virtue of content analysis. From the research findings, it was deduced that, Philadelphia hospital encounters individual, organisational and technological challenges that affected their current knowledge retention practices in the nursing profession. However, challenges also occurred when professional nurse were reluctant to participate in knowledge retention practices due to the lack of awareness and educational training programmes on the importance of knowledge retention. The study recommended alternative ways in which knowledge retention practices for professional nurses may be enhanced, this included the following: development of knowledge retention policy, awareness training programmes on knowledge retention, reward systems and programmes for effectively encouraging professional nurses to participate in knowledge retention practices, programmes for recovering lost knowledge, conducting knowledge audits on the basis of lost knowledge, making resources available for utilising retirees to capture their expert knowledge, identifying and adopting tools for preserving nursing knowledge. The study suggested that more studies should be conducted on knowledge retention in the nursing profession in South Africa, particularly quantitative research studies that will explore the concept on a broader quantifiable approach. The study further suggested that factors to be explored should also include, knowledge retention tools, knowledge retention challenges, knowledge retention practice enablers and enhancers within healthcare sectors, particularly within the nursing profession.

Abstract: Anatomy requirements in current accreditation guidelines for allied health professions training are not comprehensive, possibly due to the lack of evidence-based research available. For health professionals to work effectively in an inter-professional relationship there needs to be evidence of acceptable education standards and the need for a standardization of a minimum level of competency across the different health disciplines, including anatomy. Research on trends in anatomy education including teaching modalities within chiropractic programs is therefore required in order to inform a framework for standard guidelines and recommendations to assist in future refining, improving and accrediting these programs. This thesis aims to improve knowledge of the current trends and standards in anatomy education in Australian chiropractic programs. Chapter 1 provided a synopsis of the history of the chiropractic profession from its beginnings and its history in Australia. The chapter particularly focused on the status of chiropractic in the Australian healthcare system and its involvement in the care of musculoskeletal disorders. This chapter highlighted the extensive research undertaken on anatomy in medical programs in comparison to the paucity of information on anatomy teaching in Australian chiropractic programs. Chapter 2 highlighted the strategic priority of anatomy in chiropractic programs in Australia and provided a description of the course structure, delivery methods, assessment methods, teaching resources, and anatomy academic staff profile in each of the four Australian chiropractic programs. Chapter 3 confirmed Australian chiropractors’ perceptions on the relevance and adequacy of anatomy training for clinical practice and analysed their opinion on the usefulness of the teaching resources utilized during their preprofessional training. Chapter 4 evaluated the level of knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy in practicing chiropractors and compared this level of knowledge against that of a cohort of chiropractic students, as a measure of assessment of anatomy knowledge retention in the transition from university to clinical practice. Chapter 5 evaluated musculoskeletal items that were considered essential for inclusion in a chiropractic teaching program, as rated by anatomy and chiropractic academics to ensure adequate preparation for safe practice and to promote alignment with the standards of anatomy education delivered into the clinical professions. Conclusions, including limitations of this research are provided in Chapter 6 along with future directions.

Abstract: Knowledge management is crucial to the sustainability and success of an organisation. Identifying and sourcing knowledge is critical for modern, multi-national organisations which strive for competitive advantage across multiple markets. Organisational development, change management, innovation and efficacy can all be improved through the active management of knowledge. At base level, social media provides a means for people to communicate, share information and content, interact, collaborate and foster relationships between one another and between individuals and organisations. Social media’s use within organisations is on an upward trajectory, facilitating employee interaction, collaboration and communication. Knowledge management without social media’s assistance leaves organisations with problems, such as knowledge retrieval, connecting knowledgeable individuals, knowledge retention and knowledge dissemination. Knowledge management enabled through social media, however, facilitate effective knowledge management by increasing knowledge access, creation, exchange and storage. However, these two concepts are not entirely harmonious, with challenges arising from several factors, such as data overload, protection, privacy and validity. This study employed the interpretivist research philosophy. This allowed the researcher to investigate the phenomena under scrutiny while considering the beliefs, thoughts, feelings and experiences of the research participants through interpretation and observation. This study made use of the qualitative research approach. A case study was employed and data was collected through a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. This data was analysed in great detail, leading to the identification of emerging themes related to the phenomena under investigation. It was established that social media possesses both a positive and negative impact on knowledge management. Most employees understand knowledge management and its core concepts of knowledge generation, sharing, storage and application. However, while many understand these concepts, not all know how to put them into practice and effectively separate theoretical and practical knowledge. There are several benefits through knowledge management enabled through social media, but there are challenges and barriers limiting its sustainability and growth. The researcher contributed to the academic and business communities by providing a model, one which takes social media’s impact into consideration. The conventional Socialisation-Externalisation-Combination-Internalisation (SECI) model consists of elements which require in-person communication and others which require virtual communication, however, the enriched model illustrates that social media can facilitate all elements of the SECI model, acting as the central element for all four phases of the model.

Abstract: Vive-se um problema de transmissão intergeracional relativamente ao saber fazer. Um dos pontos onde se torna mais evidente é na alimentação. É cada vez mais notória a perda de saberes e desinteresse relacionados com o ato de preparar e cozinhar alimentos por parte das gerações mais novas, estando o Homem cada vez mais dependente de máquinas, que nivelam o conhecimento e assim perdendo-se a individualidade cultural. A presente dissertação de base projetual propõe-se contribuir para a modificação cultural deste paradigma, atuando na génese da pessoa, ou seja, na educação infantil. O projeto apresenta o kit kukku de utensílios de cozinha adequado às crianças, que funcione como instrumento de ligação entre as várias gerações, de forma lúdica e prática numa lógica de educação e gosto pela culinária, promovendo assim a Intergeracionalidade, a comunicação e a transmissão de saberes. A metodologia utilizada passou por compreender o estado de arte deste domínio, e também pelo estudo do comportamento humano durante a interação com os alimentos e artefactos da cozinha. Foram realizados estudos sobre a morfologia e a adequação dos materiais, tendo em conta alguns pontos fundamentais como a redução de custos, o impacto ambiental, a adequação ao público alvo, dando uma maior ênfase à segurança. Com a dupla orientação científica da engenharia e do design, julga-se ter tido um contributo positivo para assegurar um resultado adequado ao uso. Alternate abstract: There is a problem of intergenerational transmission related to know-how. One of the points where it becomes more evident is in food. The loss of knowledge and lack of interest related to the act of preparing and cooking food by the younger generations is increasingly notorious, and Man is increasingly dependent on machines, which level knowledge and this lose cultural individuality. The present project-based dissertation proposes to contribute to the cultural modification of this paradigm, acting in the genesis of the person, in early childhood education. The project presents a kit kukku of kitchen utensils suitable for children, which works as a liaison tool between the various generations, in a playful and practical way in a logic of education and taste for cooking, this promoting Intergenerationality, communication and the transmission of knowledge. The methodology used is to understand the state of the art of this domain, and also to study human behavior during interaction with food and kitchen artifacts. Studies were carried out on the morphology and suitability of the materials, taking into account some fundamental points such as cost reduction, environmental impact, suitability for the target audience, with a bigger emphasis on safety. With the dual scientific orientation of engineering and design, it is believed to have had a positive contribution to ensure an adequate result for use.

Abstract: A gestão do conhecimento surge no setor lucrativo, onde comprovou a sua capacidade de contribuir para a eficácia empresarial e apesar das organizações da economia social a reconhecerem como uma atividade cada vez mais importante no ambiente competitivo e exigente que enfrentam, a maior parte apresenta dificuldades na sua implementação. Nesse sentido, foram realizadas 20 entrevistas a profissionais de organizações da economia social portuguesas, tendo-se analisado as atividades e os processos de gestão do conhecimento, as razões para as inadequações apontadas e retiradas conclusões sobre a gestão do conhecimento em organizações da economia social e nos seus projetos. Analisaram-se as barreiras e os fatores facilitadores da gestão do conhecimento nas organizações da economia social, concluindo-se, com base na experiências apenas destas 20, que a partilha de conhecimento depende da confiança e que não se deve assumir a existência de um clima de confiança por se estar numa organização da economia social; que as parcerias e as organizações de cúpula podem desempenhar um papel importante na geração e partilha de conhecimento, desde que as organizações as integrem na sua estratégia de gestão do conhecimento; que, apesar de reportarem melhorias, existe competição entre as organizações da economia social, numa visão que prejudica a partilha de conhecimento e o seu objetivo último; e que a rotatividade de colaboradores e voluntários pode ter um grande impacto na retenção do conhecimento nas organizações, mas pode ser mitigado com a implementação de processos adequados e pode também ter aspetos positivos. Alternate abstract: Knowledge management appears in the lucrative sector, where it has proven its ability to contribute to business efficiency and despite social economy organisations recognizing it as an increasingly important activity in the competitive and demanding environment they face, most present difficulties in its implementation. In this sense, 20 interviews were conducted with professionals from Portuguese social economy organisations, having analysed the knowledge management activities and processes, the reasons for the reported inadequacies and conclusions were drawn about knowledge management in social economy organisations and in their projects. Barriers and facilitating factors of knowledge management in social economy organisations were analysed, concluding, based on the experiences of only these 20, that knowledge sharing depends on trust and that a climate of trust should not be assumed in an social economy organisation; that partnerships and umbrella organizations can play an important role in knowledge generation and sharing, as long as organisations integrate them into their knowledge management strategy; that, despite reporting improvements, there is competition between the social economy organisations, in a perspective that undermines the sharing of knowledge and its ultimate objective; and that employee and volunteer turnover can have a major impact on knowledge retention in organisations, but it can be mitigated with the implementation of adequate processes and can also have positive aspects.

Abstract: Atualmente existe um número bastante reduzido de ferramentas e experiências na área de Realidade Virtual Imersiva (RVi) no que diz respeito ao ensino de línguas estrangeiras. No entanto, esta tecnologia encontra-se cada vez mais acessível uma vez que existem cada vez mais dispositivos que suportam RVi e a preços mais baixos. Para além disto, esta tecnologia possui grande potencial para se tornar numa plataforma onde professores e educadores possam encontrar uma ferramenta de ensino personalizável, tirando partido das tecnologias de RVi e de todas as vantagens associadas, assim como oferecer aos alunos e utilizadores uma solução que proporcione motivação para estes assimilarem novas línguas. Assim, nesta dissertação desenvolveu-se uma ferramenta de RVi para ajudar professores e educadores com o ensino da língua inglesa. Para investigar o impacto de diferentes variáveis tecnológicas desta ferramenta e como é que estas podem influenciar a retenção de conhecimento, foram realizados dois estudos, nomeadamente interação e animação. Na primeira avaliação é estudada a Interação em dois níveis: com (interação com objetos e teletransporte) e sem (passivo); já na segunda avaliação averiguou-se os efeitos das animações (tanto a um nível de animações globais do corpo do avatar como ao nível da sua sincronização labial) dos avatares. A avaliação em ambos os estudos foi feita através de quatro questionários: Presença, Qualidade de Experiência, Cybersickness e Aprendizagem. Os resultados mostram um influência positiva das animações globais do corpo do avatar e da sua sincronização labial, sendo mais importante a última. Já a interação no ambiente virtual tem um impacto positivo no cybersickness e na qualidade de experiência em si. Alternate abstract: There is a limited number of tools and experiences in the Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) area concerning teaching foreign languages. However, this technology is becoming more affordable as more and more devices support iVR and at lower prices. In addition, this technology has great potential to become a platform where teachers and educators can find a customizable teaching tool, taking advantage of iVR technologies and all the associated advantages and offering students and users a solution that motivates them to assimilate new languages. Thus, in this dissertation, an RVi tool was developed to help teachers and educators teach the English language. Two studies were carried out to investigate the impact of different technological variables of this tool and how they can influence knowledge retention, namely interaction and animation. In the first evaluation, interaction is studied at two levels: with (interaction with objects and teleportation) and without (passive); in the second evaluation, the effects of the animations (both in terms of global animations of the avatar's body and in terms of lip synchronization) of the avatars were analyzed. The evaluation in both studies was made through four questionnaires: Presence, Quality of Experience, Cybersickness and Knowledge Retention. Results show a positive influence of both the global animations of the avatar's body and the lip synchronization, the latter being the most important. Interaction also reported a positive impact on cybersickness and the quality of the experience.

The Social Throughout: A Multi-sited Ethnographic Case Study of Socially Engaged Art at the Gallery

Abstract: Social practice is an approach to art-making predicated on participant involvement in the creation of an artwork. It is often made and disseminated in public spaces like parks, community centers, or schools and by artists who want to work with a variety of people. The presence of social practice within a gallery is, therefore, indicative of an artist’s willingness to have their work enfolded into discourse with institutional systems, resources, histories, audiences, and politics. Though art institutions are increasingly hosting and facilitating socially engaged art projects, little scholarship that addresses how this form of art shapes and is shaped by the gallery. Furthermore, institutions, artists, and the academics who analyze social practice tend to tell stories about this form of art that focus on final culminating events and neglect the all-important relational exchanges that transpire throughout a work. This represents a major loss of knowledge about socially engaged art because, as Helguera (2011) has argued, social practice is primarily a dematerialized form of art that lives on through the stories (images, texts, etc.) that are shared about the work. This dissertation addresses this gap with a multi-sited ethnographic case study of two social practice artworks created at two public galleries, one in Canada and one in the United States. This methodological approach leveraged participant observations and interviews to get insight into the lifecycle of each project, as well as how artists’ and gallery workers’ perspectives, objectives, and priorities shifted over the course of the work. This study found that, in these two cases, understanding the relational experiences that transpired before, during, and after culminating social practice events—what I call the social throughout —required a shift away from the notion of a final artwork. Working from deSouza’s (2018) articulation of art as “process” (p. 29) and Jackson’s (2011) argument that social practice should be examined based on how it responds to its “supporting apparatuses” (p. 33), this research shows how the durational examination of this form of art can illuminate the often surprising, banal, and fraught interdependencies of a work. At one site, I used this analytic lens to identify how the support apparatus of settler colonialism contributed to a local phenomenon of participation fatigue: exhaustion brought on by frequent and repeating requests from outsiders to participate in story collection artworks and research projects. At my second site, I distinguished how documentation images of socially engaged art represented and created new social aspects of a work. I further assert the value of expanded forms of documentation that incorporate the social throughout into a project’s storytelling. This dissertation contributes to the field of socially engaged art and the overlapping practice-focused fields of gallery education, curation, and public programming by developing new knowledge about the under-attended topic of institutionally supported social practice. By expanding the analytic focus of socially engaged art to include the social throughout , this research provides insights that artists, gallery workers, and participants can leverage in their collaborations.

Abstract: O presente relatório refere-se aos seis meses de estágio curricular realizado na Farmácia Faria, na Póvoa de Varzim, entre fevereiro e setembro de 2020. O relatório encontra-se organizado em duas partes. Uma primeira parte em que são referidas as atividades desenvolvidas ao longo do estágio, bem como o funcionamento e dinâmica diária da farmácia. Tendo em conta as circunstâncias que acompanharam o decorrer do estágio, a adaptação rápida a este ambiente foi crucial para a melhor aprendizagem e retenção de conhecimentos. Na segunda parte são apresentados os projetos desenvolvidos durante o período de estágio, sendo explicada a sua relevância e o seu enquadramento para a Farmácia Comunitária. Estes projetos foram adaptados às circunstâncias da pandemia, no entanto, acredito que alcancei os objetivos traçados, quer para o funcionamento da farmácia, quer para aprofundar os meus conhecimentos e contribuir para a minha formação como farmacêutico. Assim sendo, o tema da Covid-19 foi o primeiro a ser desenvolvido, sob a forma de uma apresentação para a equipa da farmácia, uma vez que o início do estágio coincidiu com o início da pandemia. Este projeto tinha o objetivo de fazer uma breve apresentação do vírus, de acordo com os dados conhecidos ao momento, além de referir as medidas a serem tomadas pela farmácia no seu dia-a-dia, bem como o protocolo a seguir em caso de contacto com um caso suspeito de infeção. Este projeto visou preparar a equipa para o período inicial da pandemia, que resultou no primeiro confinamento geral, de forma a elucidar eficazmente os utentes que nesta fase recorriam à farmácia para esclarecer dúvidas e questionar as formas mais corretas de prevenção, uma vez que nesta fase existia muita informação e muitas incertezas. O segundo projeto abordou o tema da ostomia, sendo desenvolvido através de uma apresentação à equipa da farmácia com o objetivo de aprofundar os conhecimentos desta temática junto dos colaboradores. Por tratar-se de um tema de interesse para a farmácia, seguiu-se a esta apresentação o desenvolvimento de um panfleto sobre as ostomias de eliminação, a disponibilizar aos utentes da farmácia ou sempre que fossem dispensados dispositivos médicos de apoio aos ostomizados. O panfleto tinha o objetivo de alertar e dar a conhecer esta temática à comunidade geral da Farmácia Faria, além de elucidar ou esclarecer alguma dúvida dos utentes ostomizados e pessoas que estavam em contato ou eram responsáveis pelo cuidar destes utentes.

Abstract: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is the third leading cause of death in Europe, with an associated survival rate of only 8%. A rapid and effective intervention of the community with the application of the Basic Life Support (BLS) algorithm and the execution of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), emphasizing chest compressions, can double chances of victim survival. Being CPR of critical impact on victim survival and extremely accessible to all the community, it is important and necessary to guarantee the quality of BLS education, optimizing CPR skills acquisition and knowledge retention. In this context, the use of devices to support CPR training trough real-time feedback are considered by international guidelines an important tool for BLS education as they allow training monitorization and show improvement on CPR training performance and skills acquisition. Based on this educational need, this project presents several approaches, from electronic sensors to exploratory optical fiber technology, for the development of a low-cost feedback device for CPR training, focused on assessing chest compression quality, in order to facilitate a more objective and regular training, potentiating a more effective knowledge acquisition and retention. From all the technologies tested, the selected approaches for prototype development showed great response and robustness to chest compressions during CPR training, providing accurate assessment of specific parameters of chest compressions, according to current international guidelines. Thus, it is expected that the proposed solution could provide an alternative or a complementary tool for CPR skills acquisition and maintenance on BLS education. As future work, it is recommended the inclusion of ventilation related measurements and further development envisioning educational validation.

Abstract: This paper highlights major methodological obstacles to studying and performing critical infrastructure protection (CIP) in general and CIP governance in particular. The study simultaneously examines a research project on and practice in the context of Swedish CIP. The complex planning approach of interest is called Styrel, a Swedish acronym for Steering Electricity to prioritised power consumers. It aims to identify and prioritise power consumers of societal importance, collectively referred to as critical infrastructure (CI), to provide an emergency response plan for the event of a national power shortage. Methodologically, the investigation uses material from document studies, interviews and a survey, which involved many actors from the Swedish case. For the analysis of the methodological obstacles, this study applies aned research and development process that encompasses four steps: data collection, data assessment, decision-making and evaluation. The paper mutually maps the insights from the research project to the empirical evidence from the case study. Through this reflective analysis, the findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges that significantly impede research and practice in the context of national and international CIP, for example, insufficient information sharing and knowledge exchange among parties, a lack of integrated and advanced methods, and uncertainty in policies that induces a variety of local approaches. In addition, since empirical research on implemented CIP plans is limited, this paper addresses this gap. It reveals five general obstacles for both research and practice: a) the access to high-quality data, b) the loss of knowledge over time, c) the interpretation and evaluation of processes and methods, d) the transferability and comparability of data, results and insights; whereas all culminate in 5) a lack of collective intelligence. The accumulation of these obstacles hinders a detailed assessment of decision-making for CIP and its consequences on society. For this reason, this study emphasises the need for enhancing mutual understanding among the various parties in the area of CIP while respecting relevant security issues when inventing novel methods that facilitate collective intelligence.

Abstract: The aim of study is to compare the contributions of virtual and real museum tours in terms of perceived presence and knowledge retention. The sample of study which was 28 third graders enrolled in a public primary school in an informal instructional process. There were two groups (virtual group and real group); one visited virtual museum (n=14), and the other (n=14) visited real one. Semi-structured interview form and student drawings were used to discuss students' evaluations about two environments. The results suggested that students who have attended virtual museum tour remember much more about the events and objects than students who have visited real museum tour. Students who attended virtual museum tours had perceived presence mostly as much as and in some cases, more than the real group students. Implementations for designing virtual and real museums for feeling more presence and contributing to knowledge retention are also included.

Abstract: Os mapas de código, que podem ser representados como grafos, são usados para descrever completamente um sistema de software. Quando inspecionamos um mapa de código, somos capazes de observar o software de uma nova perspetiva e, portanto, entendê-lo melhor. Por exemplo, podemos analisar o seu comportamento bem como as dependências que possam existir entre os vários elementos do sistema. Nesta dissertação, estudámos um mapa de código, em forma de grafo, contendo dados de controlo de versão, provenientes de projetos que estavam guardados em repositórios Git . O grafo referido contém vários tipos de informação sobre o sistema, incluindo métricas de código, como complexidade, e dados sobre os desenvolvimentos realizados. Uma vez que a estrutura organizacional definida pelos autores que desenvolvem o sistema pode originar problemas de qualidade no código, o nosso estudo concentrou-se nos problemas relacionados com os autores dos programas desenvolvidos, usando principalmente alguns dos seus dados de desenvolvimento. Após explorados os problemas relacionados com os autores, agrupámos os seus dados consoante as suas equipas e analisámos os problemas detetados, nomeadamente fragmentação e perda de conhecimento, tendo como perspetiva de análise a própria equipa de desenvolvimento. Nesse sentido, desenvolvemos um programa que é capaz de detectar os referidos problemas e de os revelar ao utilizador de forma que a sua identificação seja feita quase que instantaneamente, o que, como se sabe, facilita muito a gestão de um projeto de software. Alternate abstract: Code maps, which can be represented as graphs, are used to describe an entire software system. When we inspect a code map, we are able to observe the software in a new form, and therefore understand it better. For example, we can analyse the software behaviour and dependencies between several elements of the system. In this thesis, we study a code mapping graph that contains version control data of a set of projects located in Git repositories. The referred graph contains various information about the system, not only about code metrics like complexity, but also developers’ development data. Since the organizational structure of the developers that build the system can lead to quality problems in the software, our study focused on developers’ related problems using mainly developers’ development data. After the developers’ related problems are explored, we group the developers’ data into their correspondent teams, and analyse the problems (knowledge loss and fragmentation) once again but now in a team view. In this sense, we developed a program that detects these problems and display them to the user in a way that the identification of the problems is almost done instantly, facilitating the management of a software project.

Abstract: This phenomenological study aimed to explore a group of classroom teachers’ experiences with homework assignment in teaching mathematics. The participants of the study were 27 classroom teachers who were selected using the criterion-based sampling technique. The research data were collected with a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers and subjected to interpretive phenomenological analysis. The results showed that the teachers plan the homework they would assign the evening before the class and use resources available on the internet while planning it. It was also revealed that they assign mathematics homework for various purposes such as ensuring comprehension of the subjects, knowledge retention and use of the learned subjects in daily life. They reported that they check and provide feedback on the assigned homework during the classes that the assigned homework is sometimes done by the family members of the students and that both preparing and checking the homework take an extensive amount of time. As a solution to these problems, they suggested communicating and negotiating with the parents, getting support from school counselors and reducing the number of the themes in the primary mathematics curriculum.

Feasibility of an Online Reproductive Health Intervention for Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease or Sickle Cell Trait

Abstract: CHOICES is a feasible face-to-face (F2F) reproductive health intervention for young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) or sickle cell trait (SCT), but the feasibility of an online (OL) delivery modality has not been investigated. Exploratory research has not been conducted on participant adherence to study protocol or knowledge retention in a 24-month OL CHOICES intervention study. We compared mean adherence to study protocol in both study modalities. We then compared knowledge scores of the experimental and control group in the OL CHOICES study. Adherence is defined as the presence of a participant at any of the four data collection points during the 24-month study protocol. There were 107 participants in the OL study and 234 in the F2F study. Independent t-test were used to compare mean adherence to study protocol in participants in the two study modalities. The mean adherence postbaseline was statistically significant for all participants (p=.002) and the control groups (p=.003) between the two modalities. The mean adherence postbaseline was not statistically significant in the experimental groups between the two modalities (p=148). Knowledge scores for 107 OL CHOICES intervention participants were measured over two years using the Sickle Cell Knowledge Intent Questionnaire (SCKnowIQ). Linear regression was used to estimate the intervention effect on knowledge scores immediately after intervention dosing at baseline and postbaseline, an accumulation of the 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month data collection points. The immediate posttest knowledge scores for the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group (p= 001). There was no significant sustained group effect on postbaseline knowledge scores (p=.167). This pilot study data has shown that an OL CHOICES intervention is feasible based on adherence to study protocol and knowledge gain at immediate posttest. More testing is necessary to achieve knowledge retention postbaseline in the OL CHOICES intervention group. This data is essential to the lack of evidence-based literature on reproductive health interventions for individuals with chronic diseases, specifically SCD or SCT. Most importantly, a feasible OL CHOICES intervention will create a remote and cost-effective opportunity for individuals with SCD or SCT to receive reproductive health education at their convenience.

Abstract: This article presents a preliminary review of prior studies for an ongoing master's dissertation. It is aimed at enabling stakeholders to properly comprehend the construct of electronic learning (e-learning). E-learning is actually one of the most dynamic and enriching systems of education that exists these days. It is seen as a significant educational innovation, particularly within learning ecosystems of tertiary institutions that is found to be aiding the process of teaching and learning with technology. E-learning has further transformed educational technology, providing easy access to education for many, who hitherto were unable to go to school before the transformation. It is facilitating meaningful learning activities leading to knowledge retention and maximizing academic achievement, as learning is transferred into the real world of work and life. In this paper, the historical perspective of e-learning, operational definitions of the e-learning concept, some of the tools and platforms that support e-learning and its delivery modes are presented. Most importantly, the paper assesses the e-learning ecosystem in Nigeria's higher education sub-sector, articulates the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating e-learning into the educational arena, and then offers some recommendations to address the challenges.

Abstract: Technology has become an integral part in language education in general and English language teaching and learning in specific. Accordingly, the use of technology enhanced language learning (TELL) tools in English language learning has become common as they can improve the knowledge retention and increase engagement. The study aims at unravelling the employment of TELL tool based English vocabulary learning strategies (VLS) among non-English majored students at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HUTECH). The participants were a cohort of 240 first-year and second-year students answering the questionnaires and 20 students in responding the semi-structured interview questions. The SPSS was utilized to process the qualitative data in terms of descriptive statistics and T-Test, while the content analysis approach was employed for qualitative data analysis. The results showed that the participants employed the TELL tool based English VLS at a high level. Additionally, it is noticeable that second-year students utilized the TELL tool based English VLS more often than their first-year students.

Abstract: The testing effect--the power of retrieval practice to enhance long-term knowledge retention more than restudying does--is a well-known phenomenon in learning. However, retrieval practice is hardly appreciated by students and underutilized when studying. One of the reasons is that learners usually do not experience immediate benefits of such practice which often present only after a delay. We therefore conducted 2 experiments to examine whether students choose retrieval practice more often as their learning strategy after having experienced its benefits. In Experiment 1, students received individual feedback about the extent to which their 7-day delayed test scores after retrieval practice differed from their test scores after restudy. Those students who had actually experienced the benefits of retrieval practice appreciated the strategy more and used it more often after receiving feedback. In Experiment 2, we compared the short-term and long-term effects on retrieval practice use of individual performance feedback and general instruction about the testing effect. Although both interventions enhanced its use in the short term, only the individual feedback led to enhanced use in the long term by those who had actually experienced its benefits, demonstrating the superiority of the individual feedback in terms of its ability to promote retrieval practice use.

Gamification in nursing literature: an integrative review

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/gamification-nursing-literature-integrative/docview/2832730093/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Objective Gamification is an increasingly popular instructional strategy in nursing. The purpose of this integrative review is to explore gamification as it has been applied in nursing literature. This integrative review seeks to ask the question – What aspects of gamification have been explored in nursing literature and what aspects require further exploration? Method Whittemore, R., & Knafl, K. (2005). The integrative review: Updated methodology. Methodological Issues in Nursing Research , 52(5), 546–553 integrative review framework guided this review. Seventeen articles were reviewed and a quality appraisal tool (developed by Hawker, S., Payne, S., Kerr, C., Hardey, M., & Powell, J. (2002). Appraising the evidence: Reviewing disparate data systematically. Qualitative Health Research , 12(9), 1284–1299) was also used to evaluate the articles. Results Following the data analysis stage outlined in Whittemore and Knafl’s integrative review framework, six themes emerged: construct conceptualization; relationship between engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge retention; knowledge translation, motivation, role of technology, and gamification elements. Conclusion Gamification is of interest to the nursing profession. More study is needed to better ascertain the relationship between gamification and several of the main themes identified in this review.

Large Scale Conditional Multitask Learning for Natural Language Processing

Abstract: Recently, deep contextualized Masked Language Models (MLMs) trained on massive amount of unlabeled data pushed state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Many leading submissions on the well-known General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark are based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture. The formula "BERT + single task fine-tuning" continues to stay popular in many recent studies, constantly pushing SOTA results. However, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient since it may require a new model for each task. Moreover, it might overwrite the knowledge acquired during the data extensive pretraining, potentially hurting the generalization performance. Inspired by human ability to apply knowledge across tasks, multitask learning (MTL) is a powerful inductive transfer learning approach that showed promising in many NLP tasks. However, MTL alone doesn’t reach the performance of fine-tuning approach and many studies still apply fine-tuning after the MTL step. This lack of performance is attributed to the additional challenges like negative transfer, overfitting of low resource tasks and catastrophic forgetting. The goal of this thesis is to study the possibility of using MTL alone to outperform single task fine-tuning. This approach should address known MTL optimization challenges and data-related issues. It should limit pretraining knowledge loss and adapt to new tasks. Furthermore, the approach should be compatible with any Transformer architecture. We hypothesize that a task-conditioned pretrained architecture can handle a large-scale MTL setup, increasing the inductive transfer between tasks and leading to a better performance. Also, using a method to schedule task sampling based on its difficulty should help with varying task difficulties, task interference and avoid catastrophic forgetting. We propose a novel Transformer based architecture named Conditional Adaptive Multitask Learning (CA-MTL) consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism and a set of taskconditioned modules facilitating weight sharing. Through this construction, we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. Using CA-MTL, we outperform single task fine-tuning while being, data and parameter efficient. Using only 64.6% of the data and adding only 5.6% more trainable parameters per task (a naive fine-tuning can add 100% of trainable parameters), our base model achieved 2.2% higher performance compared to a fine-tuned BERT large model on the GLUE benchmark. Our approach showed competitive on 26 NLP tasks achieving SOTA results on many test and development sets. Alternate abstract: Récemment, les “Masked Language Models” (MLMs) entrainés sur une large base de données non étiquetées ont généré des résultats de pointe pour plusieurs tâches dans le domaine du Traitement de Langage Naturel (NLP). Un grand nombre des soumissions les mieux classées au benchmark “General Language Understanding Evaluation” (GLUE) utilisent un modèle basé sur l’architecture “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers” (BERT). La formule “BERT + “fine tuning” par tâche individuelle” demeure prévalente dans la recherche ; cet outil permet en effet à plusieurs chercheurs d’aboutir à des résultats de pointe. Cependant, la méthode du “fine-tuning” manque d’efficacité quant à la quantité de paramètres utilisés, puisqu’il est probable qu’elle requière un nouveau modèle pour chaque tâche. De plus, cette méthode est susceptible d’entraîner la perte des connaissances acquises durant l’étape riche en données du pré-entraînement, ce qui pourrait affecter la performance de généralisation du modèle. L’Apprentissage Multi-Tâche (MTL) est une approche efficace par transfert inductif inspirée par les modes d’apprentissage de l’humain qui s’avère prometteuse dans le domaine du Traitement de Langage Naturel. Pourtant, le MTL n’atteint pas le même niveau de performance que l’approche du “fine-tuning” qui est encore appliquée après l’étape de l’Apprentissage Multi-Tâche dans plusieurs études. Ce manque de performance est dû aux difficultés additionnelles telles que le transfert négatif, le sur-apprentissage de tâches pauvres en données et la perte de connaissances. Cette thèse a pour objectif d’explorer la possibilité de surpasser la performance de la méthode de “fine-tuning” en utilisant exclusivement l’Apprentissage Multi-Tâche. Cette recherche prendra en compte les défis d’optimisation connus de l’Apprentissage Multi-Tâche et des problèmes communs relatifs aux données. De plus, elle doit limiter du mieux possible la perte de connaissances acquises à l’étape du pré-entrainement, doit s’adapter facilement aux nouvelles tâches et être compatible avec tous les types de “Transformer”. Nous partons sur l’hypothèse qu’une architecture conditionnée par tâche est capable de gérer une configuration de MTL à grande échelle afin de maximiser le transfert entre toutes les tâches. L’utilisation d’une méthode d’échantillonnage basée sur la difficulté de chaque tâche pourrait gérer les différents niveaux de difficulté des tâches, ainsi que minimiser l’interférence et la perte de connaissances. Nous proposons un modèle innovateur basé sur l’architecture “Transformer” que nous nommons "Conditional Adaptive Multitask Learning" (CA-MTL). Cette approche consiste en un nouveau mécanisme d’attention conditionnelle et un ensemble de modules conditionnés par tâche facilitant le partage de paramètres. Par le biais de ce modèle nous atteignons un partage de paramètres plus efficace et limitons la perte de connaissances en fixant les paramètres du modèle pré-entraîné. En utilisant CA-MTL, nous obtenons une meilleure performance que la méthode du “fine tuning” par tâche individuelle, tout en optimisant les données et les paramètres. Notre petit modèle a de ce fait obtenu une performance 2.2% supérieure à celle d’un grand modèle BERT pour le benchmark GLUE ; ces résultats ont été atteints en utilisant uniquement 64.6% des données et en ajoutant 5.6% de paramètres entraînables additionnels par tâche. Il est à noter ici qu’une méthode de “fine tuning” naïve peut ajouter jusqu’à 100% de paramètres entraînables. Notre approche s’est par ailleurs démontrée concurrentielle pour 26 tâches de Traitement de Langage Naturel, parvenant à des résultats novateurs sur plusieurs ensembles de test et de développement.

Abstract: The neonate's initial limited ability to break down bilirubin is influenced by multiple physiological systems. Student midwives must understand the bioscience underlying neonatal jaundice to appreciate clinical care recommendations and advise parents. A tension exists when students are taught in large lectures with limited time. Evidence suggests that they prefer learning bioscience in the context of clinical situations with interaction. Multimedia provision using scenario video clips were therefore developed to facilitate learning and information giving. This study is located within the paradigm of pragmatism, using Action Research. It is insider research, where the researcher is the lecturer. Cycle-one explored midwifery students' perceptions of this learning taught as large groups. This advised resource developments, lecture content and timing modifications. Cycle-two evaluated the impact of changes, formative questioning, and the lecturer in inspiring learning. Students' feedback, module leaders' interviews and analysis of formative and summative assessments were employed. Participants appreciated a variety of active learning and multimedia, including video-clips, audience response systems (ARS), online material and questioning an enthusiastic lecturer. They desired incremental teaching, with adequate bioscience time. The perception of value of scenario clips was not determined by participants' cohort or age. Module leaders acknowledged that large lectures limited learning. They restricted bioscience teaching time due to an extensive curriculum. Lecture changes showed positive evaluations and statistically improved short-term knowledge retention (p < .001). This thesis offers insight into midwifery students' learning about neonatal jaundice in a unique environment, and their abilities to advise appropriately in their professional role. The insights obtained informed a bioscience teaching strategy for midwifery students in large lectures. This is potentially transferable for use with other student groups. The timing of bioscience lectures and the use of ARS with jigsaw learning, to develop bioscience vocabulary, were not previously examined in the literature. Further research on midwifery curriculum bioscience organisation is recommended.

Abstract: Desde o seu nascimento, a indústria aeronáutica tem vindo a vivenciar mudanças relativamente a como um operador aéreo realiza as suas atividades de manutenção e como treina os seus técnicos de modo a manter a aeronavegabilidade da sua frota, sendo que a ocorrência de incidentes/acidentes que resultem do incumprimento das regulações/procedimentos impostos pela operadora aérea sejam um foco de melhoria. Com a evolução e surgimento de tecnologias de Realidade Virtual, foi possível a entidades formadoras aprovadas segundo a regulação EASA Part-147, incorporar e direcionar este conhecimento para o treino de técnicos de manutenção. No entanto as mesmas apenas devem ser usadas como uma ferramenta complementar ao treino prático, pois não permitem que se adquira aptidões práticas para realizar tarefas manuais como soldadura, furação, aparafusamento, entre outros. Estas tecnologias permitem que o instruendo tenha a possibilidade de testar os seus conhecimentos teóricos a qualquer momento sem estar limitado pela disponibilidade de componentes reais para dar continuidade à sua formação. Todo este processo de treino com auxílio a aplicações de Realidade Virtual pretende melhorar a retenção de conhecimento, que necessariamente levará a um aumento nas taxas de aprovação dos instruendos. Neste trabalho pretende-se realizar o estudo de viabilidade e desenvolvimento de um demonstrador de Realidade Virtual direcionado ao treino de manutenção, para operações de fuel servicing para a aeronave A29B Super Tucano, com o objetivo de reduzir o número de relatos de incidentes/acidentes resultantes de um procedimento mal-executado. A aplicação de Realidade Virtual desenvolvida no decorrer de este trabalho de investigação, teve por base o motor de jogo Unity, em que o utilizador pode recorrer ao hardware VR atualmente disponível, ou a rato e teclado para realizar o procedimento de fuel servicing . A utilização em simultâneo das opções anteriormente referidas não é possível. Para cada procedimento, três modos de realização da tarefa são possíveis, a versão guiada, não-guiada e RV. A versão guiada fornece ao utilizador uma experiência orientada, onde qualquer desvio do manual de manutenção para o procedimento de reabastecimento escolhido não é permitido. Cada tarefa, segundo a ordem tal como surgem no manual estará destacada, de modo a fornecer uma indicação visual da tarefa a ser executada. Uma cópia exata do manual da Embraer para o procedimento escolhido é também fornecida para ser usado como um checklist. A versão não-guiada permite desvios aos procedimentos do manual de manutenção, assim como a realização de ações erradas do procedimento. No entanto, no final do treino são fornecidos elementos para quantificar os eventuais desvios do manual que tenham ocorrido durante o procedimento. Neste caso, o manual é igualmente fornecido, mas sem checklist. Por fim, na versão de Realidade Virtual, tal como acontece na versão guiada, os fundamentos são iguais, no entanto, a diferença que merece maior destaque é o facto de os aparelhos de input e output deixem de ser o rato, teclado e monitor e passamos a usar um HMD e handheld controllers . Alternate abstract: Since the birth of aviation, the industry has experienced changes on how an airline operator must perform maintenance operations and how new technicians are trained to perform them to ensure the airworthiness of the aircraft, where the reduction of human errors resulting from non-compliance to the stipulated regulations are one of the main concerns. With the surge of new Virtual Reality technologies, EASA Part-147 approved organizations are enabled to incorporate and direct this new knowledge to the training of new EASA Part-66 approved technicians. However, Virtual Reality technologies must only be used and thought of as a complementary training tool, as it does not provide competencies to perform manual actions as welding, drilling, screwing, among others. Virtual Reality allows the trainee to test his theoretical knowledge at any given time without being limited by the availability of real equipment/components necessary to continue his training, without creating the risk of causing any material damage. All the training performed while resorting to the use of Virtual Reality technologies aims to improve knowledge retention, resulting in better approval rates. In this dissertation, a feasibility study and development of a Virtual Reality demonstrator directed to maintenance training for fuel servicing operations over an A-29B Super Tucano aeroplane must be performed, with the reduction of incidents/accidents reports resulting from wrongly performed procedures set as the main goal. The Virtual Reality application was built on a game engine called Unity, where the user can choose from VR hardware currently available or a mouse and keyboard to perform a fueling procedure. For each procedure, there are three modes available, guided, unguided and VR versions. The guided procedure will provide the user with an oriented experience, where no deviation from the maintenance manual for the fuel servicing action chosen can be performed. Each task will be highlighted in the correct order, providing a visual indication of the task to be executed. An exact copy of the Embraer maintenance manual for the designated procedure will also be provided to be used as a checklist. The unguided procedure allows deviation from the maintenance manual and wrong actions are allowed to be performed. However, a score will be given at the end of the procedure to evaluate how accurately the manual was followed. Embraer maintenance manual will be also provided, but with no checklist. Lastly, the VR version will follow the same fundamentals as the guided version. However, the input and output devices used on the previous 2 versions are replaced by an HMD and two handheld controllers.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 Sustainable Leadership and Academic Excellence International Conference (SLAE) Conference Start Date: 2021, Nov. 9 Conference End Date: 2021, Nov. 11 Conference Location: Manama, Bahrain In the past few decades, web-based education or e-Learning has become a popular means of communication not only at an individual level but also at the professional and educational level. It can cater to the broad spectrum of learners with its inherent flexibility and give solutions to many existing problems of the traditional educational systems. The presented work has explored different available eLearning platforms in India and presented a review on them. The challenges in the adaptation of e-Learning are also explored. Critical remarks and possible improvements are suggested. E-learning has enormous benefits to deliver to its users. For example it can provide collaborative learning where learners work together that improves the quality of learning and hence the overall productivity. Further, in collaborative learning, learners not only work together to complete a project but also learn how to work in a team that improves decision-making skills and knowledge retention rate. Likewise, the adaptive features in e-Learning could be disruptive by incorporating AI and ML by providing e-content based on learner's pattern or style to achieve the higher level of Bloom's Taxonomy of learning objectives. E-learning can cater to a large group of learners for uniform and higher levels of learning. It also has some drawbacks for developing countries due to limited sources (infrastructural, demographic barriers, cultural diversity and others).

Abstract: Purpose: The high turnover rate of knowledge workers presents a challenge to both organizational and personal knowledge management. Although personal knowledge management plays an important role in organizational knowledge management, empirical research on the practices for its application is underdeveloped. This study aims to examine the role of idiosyncratic job-design practices (i.e. job definition, job autonomy, innovation as a job requirement and lifelong learning orientation) in cultivating personal knowledge management among knowledge workers in organizations, to increase their productivity and safeguard the organization against knowledge loss arising from knowledge workers’ interfirm mobility. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 221 knowledge workers pursuing various knowledge-intensive jobs through a questionnaire survey and were analysed using partial least squares modelling. Findings: The results demonstrated that three job-design practices (job definition, innovation as a job requirement and lifelong learning orientation) have a positive impact on personal knowledge management among knowledge workers and thus improve their productivity. However, job autonomy can affect personal knowledge management negatively. Research limitations/implications: The findings are confined to a specific context and should be replicated across different contexts for better generalizability in future research. Practical implications: Organizational managers should pay attention to (re)designing knowledge-intensive jobs to cultivate personal knowledge management by clearly outlining job responsibilities, offering opportunities to add relevant job activities and drop irrelevant ones, and making innovation and lifelong learning a formal job requirement. In addition, job autonomy should be judiciously provided along with sufficient social and network support to avoid lost opportunities in knowledge creation and sharing, and should be linked to job responsibilities and performance appraisals to avoid negative effects. Originality/value: The high turnover rate of knowledge workers presents a challenge to both organizational and personal knowledge management. This study contributes to the literature by addressing the research gap in two aspects. Firstly, based on Drucker’s theory, this study identifies four idiosyncratic job-design practices (job definition, job autonomy, innovation as a job requirement and lifelong learning orientation) that reflect the distinctive characteristics of knowledge-intensive work. Secondly, this study examines whether and how these practices can cultivate personal knowledge management among knowledge workers, which can support their productivity.

Abstract: Perception par les pêcheurs de leurs ressources fluviales : étude du cas des populations autochtones de Guyane à l’aide de la cartographie cognitive contextuelle. Dans un contexte de forte transition socio-économique au sein des populations Amérindiennes et Bushinengués, ces travaux visent à analyser la perception des pêcheurs sur les interactions entre leurs pratiques et leur environnement dans la partie haute du bassin du Maroni, au coeur de la forêt tropicale de Guyane française où la pêche de subsistance est encore très présente. Nous avons évalué le ressenti des pêcheurs des deux ethnies issues de sept villages (Pidima, Antecume-Pata, Twenké, Kayodé, Elahé, Papaïchton, Loca) en les interrogeant sur l’état des ressources naturelles, leurs méthodes de pêche, les activités à proximité et leur mode de vie. Nous avons choisi pour cela une approche d’entrevue semistructurée sous forme de questions ouvertes. La structuration de leur point de vue a été co-construite à l’aide de la cartographie cognitive pour définir les liens entre les concepts proposés ainsi que le sens et la force de leurs interactions. L’ensemble des cartes ainsi obtenues a été agrégé pour faire ressortir les opinions les plus partagées. Nous avons constaté qu’en dépit des groupes ethniques (Aluku vs Amérindiens) ou des modes de vie (subsistance vs économie de marché), la plupart des pêcheurs partageaient largement les mêmes opinions. Leur perception principale est que la pêche est menacée par l’extraction illégale de l’or, par l’utilisation croissante des filets de pêche monofilament et par une perte de connaissance de la biologie et du comportement des poissons par les jeunes générations. En parallèle, les pêcheurs perçoivent un changement de leur relation avec les ressources halieutiques : ils pratiquent de plus en plus une pêche à visée commerciale dans un contexte où le fleuve n’est plus la seule source de nourriture. Ce processus provient surtout d’une occidentalisation mal maîtrisée qui entraîne un changement douloureux des modes de vie, en particulier des Amérindiens. Dans ce travail, nous avons mieux compris la construction intellectuelle de la perception de ces menaces, et surtout, nous les avons formalisées afin de dégager des leviers d’action (meilleure maîtrise du phénomène d’occidentalisation, via un accès raisonné aux technologies et une meilleure adaptation de la scolarité aux traditions halieutiques et à l’écologie de l’environnement). Pour être efficace et durable, l’utilisation de ces leviers d’action doit émerger d’une co-construction entre pêcheurs, consommateurs et gestionnaires de l’environnement, en s’appuyant sur une gouvernance reconnue, à l’image d’un Conseil communautaire de la pêche qu’il faut réinventer. En complément, dans un contexte d’accroissement de la population et d’évolution de la consommation, une étude de cette transition alimentaire devrait être entreprise rapidement afin de l’intégrer dans le plan de gestion durable des stocks halieutiques. Alternate abstract: This study focuses on fishers’ perceptions of interactions between their practices and their environment. The study was performed in the upper section of the Maroni River in French Guiana, a relatively remote region in the tropical rainforest where subsistence fishing still occurs. We assessed the fishers’ perceptions of their relationship with the river by asking them about the state of natural resources, their fishing practices, nearby activities, and their way of life. Cognitive mapping was used to capture their individual viewpoints, especially those that formed a consensus with the other fishers. Regardless of their ethnic group (Aluku vs. Amerindian) or way of life (subsistence vs. commercial fishing), most fishers generally shared the same views. The main perception was that fishing is threatened by illegal gold mining, increasing use of fishing nets, and a loss of knowledge of fish behaviour by younger generations of villagers. Furthermore, fishers perceived an ongoing shift in their role and relationship with the fish resource, which is becoming increasingly commercially oriented, and since the river is no longer the only source of food. Detailed analysis of arguments put forward to explain these threats shows that this process originates from ill-managed Westernization, which has caused painful changes in lifestyles of local populations, especially Amerindians. This analysis can also provide local governments with mechanisms for action. Our results raise questions about the future of this region and suggest ways to protect its natural resources better. They can help decision makers respond to poorly understood informal fisheries and motivate local residents to contribute to sustainable management of a river’s natural resources.

Abstract: Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is well described in medical education but there has been little research on its application in simulation-based education (SBE). This exploratory study aimed to determine the perceptions of senior medical students at two universities to teaching and learning in SBE using PAL (PAL-SBE). Introduction Peer-assisted learning (PAL) is well described in medical education but there has been little research on its application in simulation-based education (SBE). This exploratory study aimed to determine the perceptions of senior medical students at two universities to teaching and learning in SBE using PAL (PAL-SBE).Ninety-seven medical students at two universities working in small groups with facilitator oversight wrote, ran and debriefed a simulation scenario for their peers.This was a mixed-methods study. Participants completed a written free-text and Likert survey instrument, and participated in a facilitated focus group immediately after the scenario. Thematic analysis was performed on the free-text and focus group transcripts. Methods Ninety-seven medical students at two universities working in small groups with facilitator oversight wrote, ran and debriefed a simulation scenario for their peers.This was a mixed-methods study. Participants completed a written free-text and Likert survey instrument, and participated in a facilitated focus group immediately after the scenario. Thematic analysis was performed on the free-text and focus group transcripts.Student-led scenarios ran without major technical issues. Instructor presence was required throughout scenario delivery and debrief, making the exercise resource intensive. Participant responses were more positive regarding learning as peer teachers in simulation than they were regarding participation as a peer learner. Five themes were identified: learning in the simulated environment; teaching in the simulated environment; teaching peers and taking on an educator role; learning from peers; and time and effort expended. Perceived benefits included learning in depth through scenario writing, improved knowledge retention, understanding the patient's perspective and learning to give feedback through debriefing.

Abstract: Background: Nowadays, noninvasive ventilation is the mainstay of the ventilation strategy in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and most of infants, especially preterm infants, having respiratory problems, are provided noninvasive ventilation (NIV) upon their demands. Nevertheless, complication of NIV device-related pressure injury was common, the incidence of nasal injury ranged from 20% to 60. Limited studies were found evaluating the nursing care of preterm infants receiving NIV. Aims: This study aimed to develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for preterm infants receiving NIV, implement the guideline in a NICU of a regional hospital, and evaluate infant outcomes including comfort, incidence of NIV device-related pressure injury. Besides, improvement on nurse’s knowledge and practice for caring infants under NIV were assessed.  Study design and methods: The Iowa Model-Revised was adopted as the theoretical framework to guide the study process. A multidisciplinary workgroup consists of eight stakeholders in NICU was formed for the process and acted as the champions for the new practice. A before and after study design was adopted and included the pre-implementation and post-implementation phases. An integrative review was conducted to identify relevant studies from eight electronic databases before the study. All eligible studies were appraised using the Johns Hopkins University’s evidence appraisal tool. Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS) for pain assessment and two self-developed NIV care bundle knowledge test and audit tool were used for the study. Results: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the study was extended for a month and ended in January 2021. A total of 74 infants in Pre-implementation phase (before group) and 67 infants in Post-implementation phase (after group) were recruited. Logistic regression model was used to compare the incidence of pressure injury between groups after adjusted for all substantial covariates in the study. Infants in after group had an 84% decreased odds of acquiring pressure injury (adjusted OR = 0.149, 95% CI 0.045-0.495, p = 0.002). Infant’s comfort level whilst receiving NIV was not determined in the study as the after group having a significantly lesser mean time (p < 0.001) in calm state but lower N-PASS score. Regarding nurse participants, 71 nurses received the training programme on NIV care bundle, and overall nurses’ knowledge level improved immediately (adjusted p < 0.001) and at 12 weeks after the programme. Three audits were conducted to evaluate nurses’ practice, nurses’ compliance rate to the care bundle significantly improved at 12 (p<0.001) and 24 weeks (p<0.001) in comparison with baseline compliance rate in the pre-implementation phase. However, nurses’ knowledge retention at 12-week and compliance rate at 24-week after the training programme declined. Conclusion: The evidence-based clinical practice guideline aims to promote comfort and prevent injury in infants receiving NIV, and outcomes of the infants depend on vigilant nursing care and compliance to this clinical practice guideline. Declining of nurse’s knowledge level and practice compliance found in the study indicates the needs of continuous education and audit on the practice to sustain the service quality and patient’s safety. Alternate abstract: 背景：目前，無創性通氣(NIV)是新生嬰兒深切治療部主要的通氣策略。多數有呼 吸問題的嬰兒，特別是早產兒，會根據其需要而提供 NIV 支援。然而，NIV 醫療 器材相關壓力損傷是常見的並發症，鼻損傷發生率則在 20％至 60％之間。對於接 受 NIV 早產兒的護理評估，只在有限的研究中發現。  目的：為接受 NIV 早產兒制訂無創性通氣護理之循證臨床指引、並於一新生嬰兒 深切治療部實施，及評估早產兒接受 NIV 後，醫療器材相關壓力損傷發生率及其 舒適度。此外還評估護士對早產兒接受 NIV 相關知識和護理實踐。 研究設計與方法：Iowa Modal-Revised 被採納為研究過程的理論框架。並成立一個 八人跨學科工作小組，在病房內倡導採用這新指引。本研究採用前、後期設計，即 包括實施前、後兩階段。研究前進行綜合文獻綜述，從八個數據庫中尋找相關研 究，並使用 Johns Hopkins University’s evidence appraisal tool 來評核所選研究。此外 本研究用 Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS)來評估嬰兒疼痛，及 自訂護理知識考核及審核工具來評估護士對早產兒接受 NIV 之相關知識和護理實 踐。 研究結果：由於 COVID-19 大流行，這項研究被延長了一個月，並於 2021 年 1 月 結束。本研究於新指引實施前、後，分別招募 74 名 (前期) 和 67 名嬰兒(後期)。邏 輯迴歸分析：調整後，後期的嬰兒獲得壓力性損傷可能性降低了 84%（調整 OR = 0.149，95% CI 0.045-0.495，p = 0.002）。就舒適度以言，後期的嬰兒平靜狀態的 平均時間顯著較少（p < 0.001），但 N-PASS 得分則較低。護士方面，71 名護士接 受多面的 NIV 護理培訓後，相關知識水平在培訓後立刻（調整後的 p < 0.001）及 培訓後 12 週內提高了。此外三次審核發現，新指引遵守達標率在培訓結束後 12 週 （p < 0.001）及 24 週（p < 0.001）都顯著提高。而護士知識水平和遵守達標率在培 訓結束後 12 週和 24 週，均有下降。 總結：循證臨床指引旨在促進嬰兒接受 NIV 支援的舒適度及預防壓力性損傷，嬰 兒結果取決於護理的警惕及指引遵守，而護士相關知識水平和遵守達標率在指引實 施後 24 週發現下降，說明需要持續護理教育和審核來維持服務品質和患者安全。

Abstract: Implementing a knowledge retention (KR) strategy is crucial to overcome the loss of expert knowledge due to employee turnover and retirement. The knowledge loss phenomenon caused organizations to face enormous risks which affect performance. KR frameworks and models are made available beyond research and development (R&D) organizations, to address knowledge retention strategies for administrative, operational, and manufacturing organizations. For research-intensive portfolios within R&D organizations, using the available KR frameworks requires fitting. The difficulty to address knowledge loss due to the uniqueness of the R&D organization’s knowledge artifacts requires an extended KR framework. Before designing the extended KR framework, it is crucial to determine the framework’s additional criteria. The paper reports the use of value chain mapping to determine the extended criteria of the KR framework fit for R&D organizations. The value chain mapping method identifies the knowledge activities in the R&D using Porter Value Chain (PVC) as the reference model. The output is a Knowledge Chain Model (KCM) that defines the critical points of knowledge loss in the R&D value chain. These critical points are project-based expert critical knowledge focus, project-based tacit knowledge transfer, and project-based knowledge repository which are nominated extended criteria of the KR Framework fit for R&D organizations.

Abstract: The problem is generational attrition occurs at elevated rates, and seasoned employees depart with specific knowledge, leading to organizational knowledge loss. The purpose of this qualitative exploratory case study was to examine the perceptions of baby boomer employees and leaders of baby boomer employees who participated in this study through exploring and identifying generational knowledge transfer and retention strategies at a large federal agency. The findings of this study may help strengthen the lack of the body of knowledge for large federal agencies who need to identify knowledge transfer and retention strategies to support succession planning efforts. This qualitative exploratory case study data was collected from the NIWC, Atlantic population through in-depth interviews of 14 baby boomer employees and 14 leaders of baby boomer employees, a review of TED TALK videos, and analysis through content analysis sheets archival data. Participants responded to questions about their experiences, perceptions, and thoughts regarding knowledge transfer and retention, benefits, challenges, and incentives to delay generational attrition to support succession planning efforts. Suggestions for future research and recommendations include interviewing Generation X, Y, and Z employee populations, seeking out government agencies well recognized for low attrition rates, and seeking out federal agencies with successful mentoring programs. These studies could be done with a mixed-method case study to include quantitative surveys to gauge interest in incentive programs and other benefits to delay retirement to provide time to focus on succession planning efforts.

Abstract: In the fast-paced era of educational digitization, the nature of learning styles has been changing drastically, over the time with novel learning practices. In this study, to enhance a self-paced and personalized student learning experience, an integrated approach was implemented, based on the latest system of HTML5-based interactive videos content (H5P). The proposed approach accommodated to student's affective and cognitive learning needs. The underpinnings of theoretical foundations included Brame's effective educational videos framework, and Gagne's Instructional design model. An experimental design was carried out to test the effectiveness of interactive videos in teaching the university code of ethics, which would result in better knowledge retention. Students were randomly selected from different universities (N=200). The participants were taught the university's code of ethics, policies, and procedures using the developed interactive videos-based course of Code of Ethics, and subsequently their interest, engagement, and performance were evaluated. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for analysis. It was found that the interactive videos help to enhance the level of interest and engagement among the participants, which leads to result in enhancing student performance due to knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose: The vulnerability of multinational corporation (MNC) knowledge network is one of the major causes for the failure and even the death of MNCs in the fierce global market competition. Employee turnover and knowledge loss are the triggers for the MNC knowledge network vulnerability and a matter of serious concern in the evolution and development of MNC knowledge network. The purpose of this work is to propose a valid and quantitative measurement method to investigate the influence of employee loss and knowledge loss on the vulnerability of MNC knowledge network. Design/methodology/approach: MNC knowledge network is inherently a heterogeneous network where there are mainly two types of units: employees and their knowledge. Therefore, this paper establishes a weighted super-network model for MNC knowledge network to depict its heterogeneous composition. On the basis of the weighted MNC knowledge super-network, the static and dynamic vulnerability measurement methods are further proposed to investigate and evaluate MNC knowledge network vulnerability. Findings: A real case is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed weighted MNC knowledge super-network model and the network vulnerability measurement methods. The results show the super-network model proposed in this paper can effectively embody the complex features of MNC knowledge network, and the vulnerability measurement methods can effectively investigate the influence of employee loss and knowledge loss on network vulnerability. Originality/value: From the perspective of super-network, researchers and practitioners can get a more systematic and deeper understanding of the MNC knowledge network and its human and knowledge resource constitute which are vital for the evolution and development of MNC. Moreover, the MNC knowledge network vulnerability measurement methods can effectively measure and analyze the influence of resource loss on network vulnerability, which can provide a helpful decision support for monitoring and managing of MNC knowledge network vulnerability to reduce its adverse effects.

Abstract: Noha széles köru egyetértés van arról, hogy az egyetemek a társadalomban fontos szerepet töltenek be, arról már megoszlanak a vélemények, hogy pontosan miben is áll ez a szerep. Az elvárások nagyon sokrétuek és ellentmondásosak. A tanulmányban arra a kérdésre keresem a választ, hogyan lehetne rendszerezni az egyetem társadalmi szerepeit, és ez nyújt-e támpontokat a 21. századi egyetemmel szembeni kihívásokhoz (tudásmonopólium elveszítése, nemzetállamok gyengülése, a tudás relativizálódása). A javasolt keretrendszer két szempont mentén fogalmazza meg az egyetem társadalmi szerepeit: egyrészt a termelés jellege (termék/folyamat), másrészt a társadalmi, gazdasági és politikai berendezkedéshez fuzodo viszony alapján (konszenzus/disszenzus). Ebbol kiindulva négy társadalmiszerep-modellt mutatok be: a termeloszövetkezetet, a katalizátort, a világítótornyot és a görbe tükröt. A tanulmány végén a nézetek integrálhatóságát vizsgálom meg. Alternate abstract: Although there is a broad consensus that universities play an important role in society, opinions are already divided on exactly what this role is. The expectations are very diverse and contradictory. In this study, I seek the answer to the question of how the social roles of the university could be systematised and whether this provides clues to the challenges the university of the 21st century faces (loss of knowledge monopoly, weakening of nation states, relativisation of knowledge). The proposed framework describes the social roles of the university according to two dimensions: on the one hand, on the basis of the nature of production (product/process), and on the other hand, on the basis of the relation to the social, economic and political system (consensus/dissensus). Based on this, I present four social role models: the producers' cooperative, the catalyst, the light tower and the distorting mirror. At the end of the study, I examine the integrability of views.

Abstract: Low health literacy in the chronic kidney disease population results in lower rates of pre-dialysis preparation and understanding of management to slow progression. The ABCs of Kidney Disease education class provided education in a more consistent manner outside of routine office visits. We aimed to study whether a structured education program would increase kidney disease-specific knowledge and healthcare involvement. Knowledge retention at least 6 months after the class assessed by the Kidney Disease Knowledge Surveys (KiKS) and healthcare involvement based on surveys sent to referring providers were found to have increased. Incorporation of a structured education program would be important for providers to improve long-term knowledge and lead to greater healthcare involvement. Providing an education class outside of the routine office visits will provide a greater impact on health literacy.

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to identify knowledge loss mitigation strategies that leaders can implement within the securities industry organizations. A secondary purpose was to develop evidenced based recommendations that leaders can adopt into the organizational culture. Implementing such strategies would facilitate the use of academic findings into management decision-making. The research was a qualitative, systematic review and a thematic synthesis of evidence from 48 journal articles. The primary data came from case studies, qualitative and quantitative research, and mixed method studies. The study uses Blau’s 1964 Social Exchange Theory for the theoretical framework, which derives from the study of relationships and exchanges. The literature review draws on sources from various electronic databases such as, ABI/Inform, and UMGC OneSearch, which combined more than 46 bibliographic databases. TAPUPAS and WoE were the benchmarks used for appraising the articles included in the synthesis. The extracted data cover the period from 2000 to 2021. The analysis resulted in seven overarching themes that address the research question: the environmental factors such as the organizational culture, climate, and structure; management support; reward systems; codification of explicit knowledge, and the sharing of tacit knowledge through collaboration, communication, and personal interaction. The study also found that IT infrastructure enables the documentation and transfer of explicit and tacit knowledge into company internal systems such as knowledge repositories, knowledge portals, documents management systems, company intranet, and enterprise wiki using web 2.0 technology. This study concludes with three implications for practitioners and recommended areas for further research.

Abstract: Introduction In the present Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME), learning is more student-centered where the students take the responsibility for their learning. Anatomy is an important basic science that lays the foundation for clinical courses in the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) curriculum. To make it interesting and clinically useful, several innovative teaching-learning methods like case-based learning (CBL) and problem-based learning (PBL) are introduced. The present study was taken up to know the effectiveness of CBL as a teaching-learning method in Anatomy in improving the knowledge and retention of acquired knowledge. Material and Methods This was an interventional cross-over study carried out at NRI Medical College and General Hospital, Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. Two hundred students studying in first-year MBBS were included in the study and divided into two batches. The batches - A and B - were exposed to CBL and didactic lecture, respectively, in the first month for Topic I, and then cross-over was done in the second month for Topic II. The knowledge of the students before and after the sessions was assessed by pre-session and post-session multiple-choice question (MCQ) tests. Knowledge retention was assessed by another MCQ test conducted four weeks after the post-session test. Results The average difference of the scores between pre-session and post-session tests in the CBL group for Topics I and II (4.01±1.17 and 3.8±1.6) are significantly more compared to the didactic lecture method (3.3±1.3 and 1.9±1.2). The average difference of the scores between the post-session tests and retention-tests in the CBL group (0.122±1.05 and 0.18±1.04) were further compared to the lecture method (0.016±0.95 and 0.09±0.8) for Topics I and II, respectively. There was a significant increase in the proportion of students with scores above 50% in the post-session test and retention test in the CBL group compared to the didactic lecture group. Conclusion Results from the pre-session tests, post-session tests, and retention tests for both the topics indicate that CBL as a teaching-learning method in Anatomy is a more effective method for improving and retention of knowledge.

Abstract: Knowledge management is of significant interest in the management field. In our digital society that is driven by advanced technological changes, efforts towards knowledge management are becoming highly important as knowledge knows no boundaries. This study is conducted to observe the importance of succession planning initiatives towards knowledge retention. To remain competitive in this digital society, succession planning is a process that cannot be ignored by any organization. It involves the nourishment of talent and thus, its processes affect the organization, financially and operationally. Of 150 questionnaires distributed, 102 were returned and analyzed, yielded a 68% response rate. Based on a deductive method, of the six dimensions of succession planning, there were only two hypotheses supported. It was established that, only top management support and strong organizational culture have significant effect towards knowledge retention. Practical and managerial implications were discussed.

Abstract: Aims & Hypothesis: Touch Surgery (TS) is a mobile application simulator used by more than one million healthcare professionals around the world. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate knowledge retention of pre-doctoral dental students regarding the anatomy of the maxillary sinus floor and sinus elevation procedure when using the Touch Surgery (TS) mobile application (“Anatomy for maxillary sinus floor augmentation” module) compared with the traditional educational methods. The secondary aim of this study was to assess the students’ perception via semi-structured interviews regarding their experience with the TS app and its use to enhance the learning process. We hypothesized that the use of TS app (“Anatomy for Maxillary Sinus Floor Augmentation” module) will have a positive impact on the knowledge retention (higher scores ≥ 20%) for pre-doctoral students as compared to traditional educational methods. Materials & Methods: A randomized controlled trial was performed at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) in a virtual setting. To achieve triangulation of the data, this study used a mixed methods design, integrating quantitative and qualitative data. Third year dental students’ participants from TUSDM were randomly allocated to either a control or test group. Control group used traditional educational methods and test group used TS app for learning anatomy of maxillary sinus floor augmentation. For the quantitative data, pre-assessment and post-assessment test assessed participants knowledge of anatomy of maxillary sinus floor augmentation. For the qualitative data, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the test group to learn from their experience using the TS app. The qualitative responses were independently coded and after identifying the main themes word clouds were generated using nVivo software. For the quantitative data, a power calculation was performed in nQuery Advisor and a minimum sample size of 10 participants per group for a total of 20 participants was calculated. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics Software 26. Results: A total of 17 third year dental students at TUSDM consented to participate in this study (N = 9 control group and N = 8 test group). This study found that test group was able to improve (pre-assessment mean; 19.13, post-assessment mean; 20.75) as compared to control group (pre-assessment mean; 16.78, post-assessment mean; 16.67). However, the results were not statistically significant (pre-assessment p-value; 0.08, post-assessment test p-value; 0.07). For the qualitative data, during the semi-structured interviews of the test group (n = 5), majority of participants reported that TS app represents an informative and engaging training tool. Conclusions: This randomized controlled trial reports that the TS app is a comparable tool to traditional educational methods, evaluated using the knowledge retention scores. Based on the qualitative data, this tool was well received by the dental students. Academic institutions should consider integrating technology that can facilitate knowledge retention and is well received by the students. Future studies might focus on the impact of integrating this technology to improve patient care outcomes in a dental school setting.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 20th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) Conference Start Date: 2021, Dec. 13 Conference End Date: 2021, Dec. 16 Conference Location: Pasadena, CA, USA We introduce a new application domain to evaluate the knowledge retention of language models. Our model, Keras-BERT, is trained on the Keras code documentation. This is a unique challenge of language modeling small datasets, as well as combining natural language and code data. We evaluate how well KerasBERT learns the Keras Deep Learning framework through cloze test evaluation. We present miscellaneous properties of these cloze tests such as mask positioning and prompt paraphrasing. KerasBERT is an 80 million parameter RoBERTa model, which we compare to the Zero-Shot learning capability of the 6 billion parameter GPT-Neo model. We present a suite of cloze tests crafted from the Keras documentation to evaluate these models. We find some exciting completions that show KerasBERT is a promising direction for question answering and schema-free database querying. We conclude our work by discussing some future directions for KerasBERT and the development of language models for code documentation support.

Abstract: The third graders of Cheyenne Elementary scored lower on state-mandated mathematics assessments than on reading assessments in three of the last seven years. While there was a reading coach on staff for Cheyenne Public Schools, there was not a position dedicated to math intervention to assist the students who scored below grade-level in mathematic skills. Research conducted by Binkiewicz (2006), Gardner (1993), Morrison et al. (2013), Ormrod (2020), Riotta (2016) and Yoho (2011) suggests that learners’ depth of knowledge, knowledge retention, and therefore, knowledge transfer increase when instructors present material and learners apply it through various means. Consequently, this Problem of Practice explored how the school’s music teacher could enhance and thereby increase students’ depth of knowledge and knowledge retention in the areas of geometry and measurement using a curriculum focusing on blending mathematics content with music content. Action research is conducted by teachers who seek to study and improve their own and their school’s instructional practices. Action-based researchers are familiar with the context of the problem at hand. They also personally know their participants. Combining the two factors allows the researcher to be thoroughly involved and engaged in the search to solve the problem (Efron & Ravid, 2020). In this study, I served as the researcher, the curriculum writer, and the educator. Hence, action research proved to be the best course of action. Instruction focused on two specific mathematics objectives, attributes of 3D shapes and elapsed time, because they were the two lowest scores on benchmark assessments administered prior to the study. Along with instruction received in the mathematics classroom, by implementing strategies that infused mathematics content with music content, such as that found in the curriculum Music and Mathematics: A Reciprocal Relationship, the study’s participants experienced an average of an 8% increase in benchmark scores for attributes of 3D shapes and a 21% increase for elapsed time. Moreover, the entire class experienced increases in mathematics success.

Abstract: Background The Republic of Georgia is part of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot, and human agricultural plant use dates back at least 6000 years. Over the last years, lots of ethnobotanical research on the area has been published. In this paper, we analyze the use of food plants in the 80% of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces. We hypothesized that (1) given the long tradition of plant use, and the isolation under Soviet rule, plant use both based on home gardens and wild harvesting would be more pronounced in Georgia than in the wider region, (2) food plant use knowledge would be widely and equally spread in most of Georgia, (3) there would still be incidence of knowledge loss despite wide plant use, especially in climatically favored agricultural regions in Western and Eastern Georgia. Methods From 2013 to 2019, we interviewed over 380 participants in all regions of Georgia not occupied by Russian forces and recorded over 19,800 mentions of food plants. All interviews were carried out in the participants’ homes and gardens by native speakers of Georgian and its dialects (Imeretian, Rachian, Lechkhumian, Tush, Khevsurian, Psavian, Kakhetian), other Kartvelian languages (Megrelian, Svan) and minority languages (Ossetian, Ude, Azeri, Armenian, Greek). Results The regional division was based primarily on historic provinces of Georgia, which often coincides with the current administrative borders. The total number of taxa, mostly identified to species, including their varieties, was 527. Taxonomically, the difference between two food plant groups—garden versus wild—was strongly pronounced even at family level. The richness of plant families was 65 versus 97 families in garden versus wild plants, respectively, and the difference was highly significant. Other diversity indices also unequivocally pointed to considerably more diverse family composition of wild collected versus garden plants as the differences between all the tested diversity indices appeared to be highly significant. The wide use of leaves for herb pies and lactofermented is of particular interest. Some of the ingredients are toxic in larger quantities, and the participants pointed out that careful preparation was needed. The authors explicitly decided to not give any recipes, given that many of the species are widespread, and compound composition—and with it possible toxic effects—might vary across the distribution range, so that a preparation method that sufficiently reduces toxicity in the Caucasus might not necessary be applicable in other areas. Conclusions Relationships among the regions in the case of wild food plants show a different and clearer pattern. Adjacent regions cluster together (Kvemo Zemo Racha, and Zemo Imereti; Samegrelo, Guria, Adjara, Lechkhumi and Kvemo and Zemo Svaneti; Meskheti, Javakheti, Kvemo Kartli; Mtianeti, Kakheti, Khevsureti, Tusheti. Like in the case of the garden food plants, species diversity of wild food plants mentioned varied strongly. Climate severity and traditions of the use of wild food plants might play role in this variation. Overall food plant knowledge is widely spread all-across Georgia, and broadly maintained.

Abstract: Purpose: This study examined the long-term retention of radiological sciences’ theoretical and practical knowledge among two cohorts of Saudi male and female students and interns at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)-Jeddah campus. Methods: A longitudinal panel study was conducted among fourth-year radiological sciences undergraduate students and interns at KSAU-HS, KSA-Jeddah campus. The students were invited to voluntarily retake three onsite 40-multiple-choice-questions midterm exams after one-year interval from their initial midterm exams, whereas the interns retook the same three exams after two years interval. One of the three exams was for a practical course, while the other two were for theoretical courses (ie, one incorporated a blending learning instructional strategy and the second employed a passive learning strategy). The initial exams’ scores were retrieved. Paired samples t -test was used to compare paired test scores, and one-way analysis of variance was used to examine differences in the retention percentages between the three courses. Results: Out of all 42 fourth-year students and interns, 35 (83.3%) participated. The one-year and two-year retake exams’ mean scores were significantly lower than the initial exams’ mean scores for the three courses and among students and interns (P < 0.05). The one-to-two years retention of practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge via a blended learning instructional approach was 61.5– 78.6%, more than the retention of theoretical knowledge via a passive learning approach (47.6– 64.1%). The one-year retention of practical and theoretical information was significantly higher among male students (64.1– 78.6%) than females (47.6– 62.9%). Conclusion: Students and interns showed higher long-term retention of practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge using a blended-learning instructional approach than passive learning approach, with male students showing higher long-term knowledge retention than females. It is essential to incorporate innovative teaching strategies that promote long-term knowledge retention, such as active and blended learning.

Abstract: Purpose: This DNP quality improvement project aimed to increase intent to change practice among nurses in the medical intensive care unit regarding temperature monitoring in patients undergoing targeted temperature management (TTM) after a cardiac arrest . Background: Although many different methods of core temperature have been used to monitor temperature in patients undergoing TTM, esophageal is most closely related to pulmonary artery catheter. Pulmonary artery catheters most accurately represent temperatures in the brain. Cooling a patient after a cardiac arrest decreases metabolic needs of the brain, stops further cell death in the brain after lack of oxygen, and decreases inflammation in the brain. Methods Design: An email was sent to nurses in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) with a link to educational material and a post-learning survey. Optional in-person rounding was provided twice on the day shift and twice on the night shift. Setting: Banner University Medical Center-Phoenix, a 746-bed not-for-profit hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Banner Health’s flagship hospital. The project’s focus was in the 54-bed medical intensive care unit (MICU).Participants: Participants included core staff nurses in the MICU, and participation was voluntary. The link was sent out to approximately 100 nurses, with sixteen nurses responding. Measurements: Six knowledge retention questions were included in the survey. Four questions used the Likert scale on how they felt about the education and their intent to change practice. One question was regarding the length of time as a nurse, and one question was if they had their Critical Care Registered Nurse (CCRN) certification. There was also one open-ended question regarding barriers to implementation. Results: The results showed that nurses agreed and strongly agreed that the education was beneficial, and they had an increase in intent to change practice. The results also showed no statistically significant difference incorrect answers when comparing CCRN nurses to non-CCRN nurses, no statistically significant difference in years of nursing, and correct answers. Conclusions: Although the sample size was small, education on esophageal temperature probes increased the intent to change practice among nurses in the MICU.

The one-to-two years retention of practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge via a blended learning instructional approach was 61.5-78.6%, more than the retention of theoretical knowledge via a passive learning approach (47.6-64.1%). The one-year retention of practical and theoretical information was significantly higher among male students (64.1-78.6%) than females (47.6-62.9%). RESULTS Out of all 42 fourth-year students and interns, 35 (83.3%) participated.

The one-year retention of practical and theoretical information was significantly higher among male students (64.1-78.6%) than females (47.6-62.9%).Students and interns showed higher long-term retention of practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge using a blended-learning instructional approach than passive learning approach, with male students showing higher long-term knowledge retention than females. It is essential to incorporate innovative teaching strategies that promote long-term knowledge retention, such as active and blended learning. CONCLUSION Students and interns showed higher long-term retention of practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge using a blended-learning instructional approach than passive learning approach, with male students showing higher long-term knowledge retention than females. It is essential to incorporate innovative teaching strategies that promote long-term knowledge retention, such as active and blended learning.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 International Conference on Graphics and Interaction (ICGI) Conference Start Date: 2021, Nov. 4 Conference End Date: 2021, Nov. 5 Conference Location: Porto, Portugal Virtual Reality (VR) has been showing potential in new and diverse areas, notably in education. However, there is a lack of studies in the Foreign Language Teaching and Learning field, particularly in listening comprehension. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of avatar animations and lip synchronization, and user interaction; features deemed relevant in this broader area. A sociodemographic, a quick CEFR - Common European Framework of Reference for Languages - 15-minute English test, and questionnaire were used to evaluate the participants' Presence, Quality of Experience, Cybersickness and Knowledge Retention. Results show that, overall, the use of avatars with realistic animations and movements, and featuring lip synchronization have a positive influence on the users' sense of presence, knowledge retention and a more enjoyable overall quality of experience. The same can be said for the use of object interaction and navigation in the cultural representative environment, which had an overall positive impact.

The Development and Qualitative Impact Assessment of a Physical Activity and Nutrition Curriculum for Low-Income, High School Adolescents

Author: Desai-Shah, Het    

Publication info: Desai-Shah, Het. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/development-qualitative-impact-assessment/docview/2614712442/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The New Jersey Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (NJ EFNEP) is a federally funded program that focuses on serving diverse, low-income families across the state. After the 2015 national EFNEP meeting, where it was emphasized that outreach to older youth, i.e., teenage children ranging from 13 to 18 years old (teens), was inadequate, the NJ EFNEP staff focused on this objective. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that education curricula addressing teens’ nutrition and physical activity issues were scarce. The purpose of this dissertation was to develop and evaluate an evidence-based nutrition and physical activity curriculum to use with EFNEP teens. A comprehensive 5-phase model (Figure 4.1) was created to guide the curriculum’s development, using best practices and lessons learned from previous curricula development experiences. It provides applications of these steps and considerations for effective implementation during each phase, (i.e., activities entailing formative research and process evaluation, and key activities required for summative or outcome assessment), and flexibility in case of conflict with program policies, funding limitations, etc. The curriculum development methods closely followed the steps listed in the model. During the pilot test, qualitative impacts were collected using face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with participating teens. Teens (n=24) reported making behavior changes after attending the lessons providing evidence of the curriculum’s effectiveness. Most teens reported making >1 behavior change and changed behaviors in an average of three key topic areas. Moreover, teens reported a number of changes in behavioral antecedents, such as their attitudes, social norms, and perceived barriers to behavior modifications. Researchers also observed increased knowledge regarding the key topics among the teens. Lastly, the author of this dissertation provided recommendations for curriculum improvements based on the findings from interviews conducted with high school teachers (n=6) and NJ EFNEP educators (n=9) as a part of the curriculum’s process evaluation. Improvements were suggested to: enhance teens’ knowledge retention; improve classroom management and discipline; increase communication with teachers so they may be better informed as to how they may assist the educators, and manage activity timings during class periods. Other suggestions made were to modify specific lessons’ content. Future research that may follow this dissertation warrants quantitative assessment of the teen curriculum using a suitable questionnaire that inquires on curriculum’s impacts in its entirety. An implication of this research was to provide researchers and professionals with a structured model for the adoption or development of new, evidence-based nutrition education curricula.

Abstract: Introduction An important question for oral health education is whether knowledge gained during lay-led workshops is retained and applied in daily practice. This study assessed the knowledge retention and changes in oral health practices several months after oral health education workshops were held for migrant farmworkers by Community Health Workers (CHWs). Methods and Results Follow-up surveys were conducted with 32 participants 1 to 43 months post participation (60% between 6 and 21 months). The results showed a high degree of retention, in such areas as general oral health knowledge, and brushing/flossing frequency and technique among this sample. There was no relationship between length of time since the educational workshop and knowledge retained or behaviors changed. Conclusions and Recommendations An interactive, lay-led oral health education program run by CHWs can be an effective way to deliver sustained improvements in oral health knowledge and changes in oral health practice in migrant populations.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Conference Start Date: 2021, Oct. 13 Conference End Date: 2021, Oct. 16 Conference Location: Lincoln, NE, USA This Innovative Practice Work in Progress paper introduces a freely available API-based platform for spaced repetition education. Spaced repetition, or spaced repetition learning, is a technique used by learners to improve long-term knowledge retention through repeated exposure to information spread out through time, traditionally in the form of flashcard questions. The concept of repeated exposure to information at varying lengths of time, and its effectiveness to improve human memory, has been evolving since first being investigated in the 19th century. Recently, new mobile and web learning applications have been employing spaced repetition algorithms and techniques to improve students' retention; although increasingly popular amongst students, we believe there are certain drawbacks to these systems that we set out to address in this work. First, existing solutions primarily target only students as users without providing instructor-focused functionality for supplementing their teaching; we explore, through the inclusion of instructor-focused interfaces and reporting mechanisms, potential insights to be gained about the effect of spaced repetition learning on student retention. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, current popular spaced repetition algorithms are purely question-based; that is, re-exposure delays are calculated only per question, and not per topic. To address this, we present a novel question-templating framework that 1) enables knowledge retention to be assessed and analyzed in terms of groups of questions representing topics instead of only specific questions, and 2) provides a tool for instructors to efficiently manage learning material by creating randomizable templates to feed on the fly generation of similar-but-unique question sets for each student. Third, existing solutions widely employ spaced repetition to aid memorization without leveraging it to aid generalization; we aim to highlight a potential for the spaced repetition model to promote retention of generalized skills (transferable among different challenges). Lastly, and most importantly, we seek to provide a free application programming interface (API) that can be integrated with any custom mobile or web user interface to provide the research community with a highly integrable toolkit for exploring new questions about spaced repetition learning.

Abstract: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV experience challenges with retention in care, which negatively affects viral suppression. To address this, researchers piloted Bijou, a program designed to provide health education through electronically delivered behavior and risk reduction modules. Participants were 29 YMSM aged 19-24 living with HIV from the southeastern US. Participants completed pre, post, and 3-month follow-up (3MFU) surveys assessing knowledge, intervention acceptability, satisfaction, self-efficacy, ehealth literacy, and usability. Findings revealed significant improvement in knowledge and e-health literacy from pre-test to post-test but lost significance at 3MFU. Self-efficacy scores did not show significant differences from pre-test to post-test or 3MFU. Participants who completed all modules considered Bijou usable and acceptable; however, many did not complete the program. Findings suggest a need for adaptations to promote knowledge retention, e-health literacy, engagement over time, and research with a larger, more representative sample.

Abstract: Background Understanding respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation is a challenge for healthcare workers, particularly, medical residents. A team of French-speaking experts developed an innovative MOOC incorporating interactive simulation-based videos and serious games aiming at improving knowledge and skills in mechanical ventilation. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term knowledge retention regarding key concepts presented in this MOOC. Methods French residents registered for the MOOC 2020’s winter session were invited to participate in a two-step study. The first step consisted in evaluating students’ pre-course knowledge of respiratory physiology and mechanical ventilation fusing a 20 five-item multiple choice questions test with a total score ranging from 0 to 100. For the second step, the same students answered the same test (after shuffling the questions) six months after the completion of the course. We assessed the impact of this MOOC on the students’ knowledge retention by comparing pre-course and post-course scores. Result Of the 102 residents who agreed to participate in the study, 80 completed the course and their mean ± SD pre-course score was 76.0 ± 8.0. Fifty-one respondents also completed the second and their post-course score was significantly higher than the baseline one (83.1 ± 7.3 vs. 77.5 ± 7.6, p  < 0.001). Scores of the first and second rounds did not differ upon comparing respondents’ background specialty or number of years of residency. For the vast majority of individual questions (96%), the success rate was higher at the post-course than at the pre-course assessment. Conclusion An innovative MOOC incorporating simulation-based videos was effective in teaching medical residents basic mechanical ventilation knowledge and skills, especially in the field of respiratory physiology and ventilatory modes. We observed effective long-term knowledge retention with a higher score at the post-course assessment six months after the completion of the course compared with the pre-course score.

Abstract: Background Birth asphyxia is one of the significant causes of neonatal deaths in Pakistan. Poor newborn resuscitation skills of birth attendants are a major cause of neonatal mortality in low resource settings across the globe. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Simulation-Based High-Frequency training of the Helping Babies Breathe for Community Midwives (CMW), in district Gujrat, Pakistan. Method A pre-post-test interventional study design was used. The universal sampling technique was employed to recruit 50 deployed CMWs in the entire district of Gujrat. The pre-tested module and tools of Helping Babies Breathe (2nd edition) were used in the intervention. Using the High Frequency training approach, three one-day training sessions were conducted for CMWs at an interval of 2 months. During the 2 months interval, participants were monitored and supported to practice their skills at their birthing centers. Knowledge and skills were assessed before and after each session. The McNemar and Cochran’s Q tests were applied for data analysis. Participants’ feedback was also obtained at the end of each training, which was analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results Data from 34 CMWs were analyzed as they completed all three training sessions and assessments. The results were statistically different after each training session for OSCE B ( p -value < 0.05). However, for knowledge and OSCE A, significant improvement was observed after training sessions 1 and 2 only. Pairwise comparison showed that pre-assessment at training 1 was significantly different from most of the repeated measures of knowledge, OSCE A, and OSCE B. Moreover, the learners appreciated the overall training in terms of organization, content, material, assessment, and overall competency. Additionally, due to a small sample size of the CMWs, and a short time of the intervention, significant differences in morbidity and mortality outcomes could not be detected. Conclusion The study concluded that a series of training and continuous supportive supervision and facilitation enhances Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) knowledge retention and skills. The study recommends, periodic, structured and precise HBB trainings, with ongoing quality monitoring activities through blended learning modalities would help sustain and scale-up the intervention.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 1st Conference on Online Teaching for Mobile Education (OT4ME) Conference Start Date: 2021, Nov. 22 Conference End Date: 2021, Nov. 25 Conference Location: Alcalá de Henares, Spain Many teaching and learning tools make use of existing technologies to help students learn more effectively. Three current digital technologies booming in mobile-based education are augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality. Visualising the mechanism of atoms and chemical bonding is one of the challenges faced by students in Chemistry. This study developed an immersive mobile prototype application using virtual reality technology to help students visualise the process of chemical bonding, increasing their understanding and interest. The mobile application also includes a mini game to assess learners’ knowledge retention. Initially, five students were tested to gauge their reactions and satisfaction with the app. Overall, the proposed prototype application received positive feedback and will serve as a good foundation for future mobile learning applications. There was a positive impact on learners’ knowledge growth from the proposed application.

Abstract: Low health literacy in the chronic kidney disease population results in lower rates of pre-dialysis preparation and understanding of management to slow progression. The ABCs of Kidney Disease education class provided education in a more consistent manner outside of routine office visits. We aimed to study whether a structured education program would increase kidney disease-specific knowledge and healthcare involvement. Knowledge retention at least 6 months after the class assessed by the Kidney Disease Knowledge Surveys (KiKS) and healthcare involvement based on surveys sent to referring providers were found to have increased. Incorporation of a structured education program would be important for providers to improve long-term knowledge and lead to greater healthcare involvement. Providing an education class outside of the routine office visits will provide a greater impact on health literacy.Low health literacy in the chronic kidney disease population results in lower rates of pre-dialysis preparation and understanding of management to slow progression.

Abstract: Learning by teaching others is a potent educational strategy, but its implementation is typically cumbersome. This study (N = 108) investigated "silent teaching"--writing a verbatim teaching script--as a convenient approach for independent learning, while assessing whether the teaching benefit is a production benefit. Learners studied a science text on the Doppler effect using one of three learning methods: (1) generating and studying their own notes (restudying control), (2) preparing to teach and then verbally teaching (verbal teaching), or (3) preparing to teach and then writing a verbatim teaching script (silent teaching). On a conceptual knowledge retention test 1 week later, participants who wrote teaching scripts performed as well as those who taught verbally; both teaching groups outperformed control learners. Verbal and silent teaching significantly increased social presence and elaboration to comparable extents, relative to restudying. "Silent teaching" is a promising and efficient alternative learning approach to traditional verbal teaching.

Abstract: The purpose of this phenomenological study was to understand perceptions held by School Resource Officers (SROs) of their personal ability to intervene during a mental health crisis on campus. SROs are uniquely positioned to quickly identify and intervene during a mental health crisis situation if properly training. Currently, training mandated for South Carolina SROs does not contain de-escalation skills and leaves officers with low confidence of their ability, based on training, to adequately intervene. While crisis intervention training is available to officers, such as Crisis Intervention Team (CIT), it does not address students in the educational setting. Crisis intervention training in the school setting is crucial to stem the tide of ever-increasing numbers of students with mental illness being inappropriately referred to the criminal justice system, expelled from school, hospitalized or, in many cases, a combination of all of these. Furthermore, the training must be presented in a method resulting in the highest level of knowledge retention and self-confidence by the officer employing the training in real-life situations. Utilizing an anonymous online survey and interviews, this research discovered significant role ambiguity among 13 participants. A lack of adequate crisis intervention training as well as the lack of collaboration between SROs and schools to develop response protocols during mental health crisis episodes were also noted. Although participants desired training, the study found SROs perceived a lack of training with regards to the handling of students experiencing a mental health crisis. Lacking proper training and protocols, officers lacked critical support needed to help all students in the schools, perpetuating the school to prison pipeline. Additional research is needed to further discover methods to adequately equip SROs in the collaborative effort to help students.

Abstract: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is commonly used to triage and monitor the evolution of stroke victims. Data regarding NIHSS knowledge in nurses and physicians working with stroke patients are scarce, and a progressive decline in specific knowledge regarding this challenging scale is to be expected even among NIHSS certified personnel. This protocol was designed according to the CONSORT-eHealth (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. It describes the design of a randomized controlled trial whose primary objective is to determine if nurses and physicians who work in stroke units improve their NIHSS knowledge more significantly after following a highly interactive e-learning module than after following the traditional didactic video. Univariate and multivariable linear regression will be used to analyze the primary outcome, which will be the difference between the score on a 50-question quiz answered before and immediately after following the allocated learning material. Secondary outcomes will include knowledge retention at one month, assessed using the same 50-question quiz, user satisfaction, user course duration perception, and probability of recommending the allocated learning method. The study is scheduled to begin during the first semester of 2022.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW) Conference Start Date: 2021, Oct. 11 Conference End Date: 2021, Oct. 17 Conference Location: Montreal, BC, Canada Many applications based on aerial imagery rely on ac-curate object detection, which requires a high number of annotated training data. However, the number of annotated training data is often limited. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot detection method for aerial imagery that aims at detecting objects of unseen classes with only a few annotated examples. For this purpose, we extend the Two-Stage Fine-Tuning Approach (TFA), which achieves state-of-the-art results on common benchmark datasets. We pro-pose a novel annotation sampling and pre-processing strategy to yield a better exploitation of base class annotations and a more stable training. We further apply a modified fine-tuning scheme to reduce the number of missed detections. To prevent loss of knowledge learned during the base training, we introduce a novel double head predictor, yielding the best trade-off in detection accuracy between the novel and base classes. Our proposed Double Head Few-Shot Detection (DH-FSDet) method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on publicly available aerial imagery datasets. Finally, ablation experiments are performed in or-der to get better insight how few-shot detection in aerial imagery is affected by the selection of base and novel classes.

Abstract: With the rapid development of coal mine intelligent technology, the complexity of coal mine equipment has been continuously improved and the equipment maintenance resources have been continuously enriched. The traditional coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge management technology can no longer meet the current needs of equipment maintenance knowledge management, and the problems of low utilization rate, poor interoperability, and serious loss of knowledge have gradually emerged. It is urgent to study new knowledge system construction and knowledge management application technology for large-scale coal mine equipment maintenance resources. Knowledge graph is a technical method to describe the relationship between things in the objective world by using a graph model. It can effectively solve the problem of knowledge dynamic mining and management under large-scale data. Therefore, this paper focuses on the establishment of a coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge graph system by using knowledge graph technology. The main research contents are as follows: Firstly, based on the current situation that there is no unified basic knowledge system in the field of coal mine equipment maintenance, this paper establishes the coal mine equipment maintenance ontology (CMEMO) to effectively solve the problem that there are no unified representation, integration, and sharing of coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge in this field and provide support for the construction of coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge graph. Then, aiming at the problem that the traditional named-entity recognition method has a poor recognition effect and relies too much on artificial feature design, this paper proposes a named-entity recognition model for coal mine equipment maintenance based on neural network (BERT-BiLSTM-CRF) and applies the model to the coal mine equipment maintenance data set for verification. The experimental results show that, under the same data set, the entity recognition effect of this model is more leading than that of other models. Finally, through demand analysis and architecture design, combined with the constructed ontology model of coal mine equipment maintenance field, the entity identification of coal mine equipment maintenance is completed based on the BERT-BiLSTM-CRF model and the Django application framework is used to build the coal mine equipment maintenance knowledge graph system to realize the functions of each module of the knowledge graph system.

Abstract: Objectives: This study aims to explore GP residents' knowledge retention and residents' and clinical teachers' perception on the learning value of a dermatology E-learning programme. Methods: The study used a mixed-method design with a convergent parallel collection of data. GP residents (n=21) were selected through purposive sampling and were randomized to an E-learning group (n=12) or a traditional teaching methods group (n=9). The pre-and post-intervention knowledge tests of the E-learning group were compared using paired-samples t-tests. Post-knowledge tests scores of both groups were compared using independent t-tests. Cronbach's coefficient a was used to calculate the internal consistency of the questions used in the knowledge tests. Individual semi-structured interviews and clinical teachers (n=16) were conducted and analyzed using King's template analysis. Results: The E-learning group showed a significant increase in mean knowledge test scores from 58.92% (SD=9.55%) to 64.92% (SD=13.65%) (t(11)=2.258, p=0.045, Cohen's d=0.51). The pre-knowledge test consisted of 46 items (Alpha=0.78), and the post-knowledge tests consisted of 45 items (Alpha=0.90). Interview data showed that the E-learning programme aided GP trainees' learning process and favoured a mixed-method teaching design, in which E-learning is used in parallel to the traditional teaching methods. Conclusions: A dermatology E-learning programme appeared an effective strategy in resident's knowledge acquiring. The key users' perceptions, both residents and clinical teachers, indicated that E-learning was feasible and helpful for learning processes. Further research is required to evaluate the implementation of E-learning programmes in parallel to regular teaching programs.

Abstract: Background Due to the role expansion of radiotherapists in dosimetric aspect, radiotherapists have taken up organs at risk (OARs) contouring work in many clinical settings. However, training of newly qualified radiotherapists in OARs contouring can be time consuming, it may also cause extra burden to experienced radiotherapists. As web-based open-source radiotherapy delineation software (WORDS) has become more readily available, it has provided a free and interactive alternative to conventional one-to-one coaching approach during OARs contouring training. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of WORDS in training OARs contouring skills of newly qualified radiotherapists, compared to those trained by conventional one-to-one coaching approach. Methods Nine newly qualified radiotherapists (licensed in 2017 – 2018) were enrolled to the conventional one-to-one coaching group (control group), while 11 newly qualified radiotherapists (licensed in 2019 – 2021) were assigned to WORDS training group (measured group). Ten OARs were selected to be contoured in this 3-phases quantitative study. Participants were required to undergo phase 1 OARs contouring in the beginning of the training session. Afterwards, conventional one-to-one training or WORDS training session was provided to participants according to their assigned group. Then the participants did phase 2 and 3 OARs contouring which were separated 1 week apart. Phase 1 – 3 OARs contouring aimed to demonstrate participants’ pre-training OARs contouring ability, post-training OARs contouring ability and knowledge retention after one-week interval respectively using either training approach. To prevent bias, the computed tomography dataset for OARs contouring in each phase were different. Variations in the contouring scores for the selected OARs were evaluated between 3 phases using Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn tests for pairwise comparisons. Variations in the contouring scores between control and measured group in phase 1 – 3 contouring were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p -value  0.05) were observed in all OARs between both groups. Conclusions The results in this study have demonstrated that the outcome of OARs contouring training using WORDS is comparable to the conventional training approach. In addition, WORDS can offer flexibility to newly qualified radiotherapists to practice OARs contouring at will, as well as reduce staff training burden of experienced radiotherapists.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 44th International Convention on Information, Communication and Electronic Technology (MIPRO) Conference Start Date: 2021, Sept. 27 Conference End Date: 2021, Oct. 1 Conference Location: Opatija, Croatia Developers' fluctuation in the lifetime of a software product might deteriorate the understanding of the source code to a level where developer expertise of some modules drops to a dangerously low point. It is important for the project management to identify such critical modules to avoid complete knowledge loss. This paper presents a developer-centered static analysis tool that is intended to show individual expertise in large software projects. The expertise value is computed for each file through repository mining of the version control system of the project. The calculated value is based on the quality of commits per developer. The results of the proposed method have been validated on the CodeChecker open-source project, comparing against the findings of a user questionnaire filled by developers of the project on their expertise.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 IEEE/AIAA 40th Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC) Conference Start Date: 2021, Oct. 3 Conference End Date: 2021, Oct. 7 Conference Location: San Antonio, TX, USA Sectorless air traffic management (or flight-centric ATC as it is known in the SESAR context) is a novel concept that restructures the airspace to make better use of the human controller as a resource. Currently investigations on the introduction of a team concept for sectorless air traffic management is being conducted. As part of this team concept, a position takeover concept is being investigated that would reduce the need for a ramp up and decline in traffic when a new controller team takes over a position that is at the end of their shift. From the results new concepts to reduce the loss of knowledge and difficulty of the position takeover are introduced that should be investigated in subsequent experiments. Further, general features of the team concept are investigated, like frequency occupancy data, controller workload and an evaluation of the tools that are available controllers.

Abstract: Retirement of baby boomers results in institutional knowledge loss and gaps in business continuity. The specific management problem is that managers in American higher education institutions have challenges maintaining business continuity as they lose institutional knowledge when baby boomers retire and millennials assume those positions. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore how organizational managers in online universities are transferring tacit knowledge from the retiring baby boomers to their millennial replacements to maintain business continuity. The conceptual framework of this study was based on Bridges’s model on transition to capture the effects of the generational changes occurring in the workforce. The overarching research questions focused on how managers in an online higher education institution manage knowledge to transfer to new managers and support business continuity for their institution. Data were collected through interviews and documents from 20 baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennial managers employed with the institution for at least three years. Yin’s five steps for qualitative data analysis and thematic coding were used to identify three key findings. One finding suggested that knowledge management should be a strategic priority, supported by institutional technology systems, procedures, and policies. Another finding identified the importance of succession planning and knowledge sharing to support business continuity through change and transition. This research study could lead to positive social change by aiding universities to prepare for future workforce changes by developing strategies to retain tacit knowledge, which will support business continuity efforts and allow them to support the communities they serve.

Abstract: El artículo de investigación analiza la transmisión del conocimiento etnobotánico en niños y jóvenes campesinos de los Andes colombianos. La transmisión del conocimiento se entiende como un proceso cultural y educativo que se fundamenta en contenidos actuantes en diversos ámbitos de socialización, incluyendo la familia y la escuela. Así, mediante una metodología etnográfica que incluyó observación participante, entrevistas abiertas y semiestructuradas y talleres con niños, niñas y jóvenes, se analiza la transmisión de los contenidos, los contextos de transmisión, sus implicaciones en las formas de valorar las plantas y su relación con los roles de género. Los resultados demuestran que los conocimientos etnobotánicos se transmiten de manera efectiva cuando hay claridad en la exposición, un medio de transmisión apropiado, un cierto grado de motivación y una capacidad mental adecuada para entender la experiencia. Se concluye que la transmisión del conocimiento etnobotánico es dinámica y se encuentra mediada por los roles de género. Niños y niñas demostraron un vínculo fuerte con la naturaleza, a pesar de que las niñas poseen un mayor conocimiento etnobotánico y los niños desarrollan habilidades para la comercialización; además, existen algunas pérdidas de conocimiento dado que a los jóvenes poco les interesa las labores del campo. Estos hallazgos son relevantes, puesto que permiten cuestionar los modelos de transmisión de conocimiento actuales, junto con las oportunidades que tendrán las futuras generaciones dentro de la nueva ruralidad. Alternate abstract: This article analyses the transmission of ethnic-botanical knowledge in child and youth peasants in the Colombian Andean region. Knowledge transmission is understood as a cultural and educational process that is based on active contents in diverse social settings, including family and school. Therefore, through an ethnographic methodology which included participant observation, open and semi-structured interviews and workshops with children and youth, the article analyses knowledge transmission in terms of content (recognition of properties and use) and the context in which it takes place, its value implications and its relation to gender roles. Results showed that ethnobotanical knowledge is effectively transmitted when there is a clear and suitable way of exposing the ideas, a certain degree of motivation and the mental ability to understand the ideas/experience. It is concluded that ethnic-botanical knowledge transmission is dynamic and mediated by culturally established gender roles. Boys and girls demonstrated a strong connection with nature, despite the fact that girls have greater ethnic-botanical knowledge and boys develop skills for commercialization. There seems to be a loss of knowledge in the youth population that is hardly interested in rural activities. These findings are relevant since they allow us to question the models of current knowledge transmission, together with the opportunities that future generations will have within the new rurality.

Os resultados mostram que os conhecimentos etnobotânicos são transmitidos de forma eficaz quando há clareza na exposição, um meio de transmissão apropriado, um certo grau de motivação e uma capacidade mental adequada para compreender a experiência. Conclui-se que a transmissão do conhecimento etnobotânico é dinâmica e mediada por papéis de gênero. As crianças demonstraram um vínculo forte com a natureza, apesar do fato de que as meninas possuírem maior conhecimento etnobotânico e os meninos desenvolverem habilidades para comercialização; além disso, existem algumas perdas do conhecimento devido a que os jovens têm pouco interesse no trabalho do campo. Esses achados são relevantes, já que permitem questionar os atuais modelos de transmissão do conhecimento, junto com as oportunidades que as gerações futuras terão dentro da nova realidade.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Conference Start Date: 2021, June 20 Conference End Date: 2021, June 25 Conference Location: Nashville, TN, USA Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained in an incremental learning setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the task incremental learning problem, which involves training a model on new tasks that arrive in an incremental manner. The task incremental learning problem becomes even more challenging when the test set contains classes that are not part of the train set, i.e., a task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem. Our approach can be used in both the zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings. Our proposed method uses weight rectifications and affine transformations in order to adapt the model to different tasks that arrive sequentially. Specifically, we adapt the network weights to work for new tasks by "rectifying" the weights learned from the previous task. We learn these weight rectifications using very few parameters. We additionally learn affine transformations on the outputs generated by the network in order to better adapt them for the new task. We perform experiments on several datasets in both zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings and empirically show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results. Specifically, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art non zero-shot task incremental learning method by over 5% on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Our approach also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art task incremental generalized zero-shot learning method by absolute margins of 6.91% and 6.33% for the AWA1 and CUB datasets, respectively. We validate our approach using various ablation studies.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE) Conference Start Date: 2021, June 20 Conference End Date: 2021, June 23 Conference Location: Kyoto, Japan This paper proposes an approach for continual learning, Knowledge Retention (KR), that learns new information without accessing data from previous tasks. A KR unit is based on the embedding layer that identifies the important kernel in the convolution layer, which preserves key parameters and allows the weights to be reused across tasks. To construct higher-order generalization, we design a Residual Knowledge Retention (RKR) architecture that facilitates the network to stack deeper layers. Additionally, we rethink the benefits of different residual blocks respectively after employing depthwise convolutions. A surprising observation is that the basic block taking advantage of depthwise convolutions achieves higher representational power and builds a more lightweight model than the bottleneck block counterpart. On the Alternating CIFAR10/100 benchmark, we empirically show that the KR unit can be integrated into diverse networks and effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we demonstrate that RKR significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art continual learning methods with at least 6 times lower model complexity in two different scenarios for continual learning, which supports that the proposed approach is more competitive for resource-limited edge devices.

Abstract: Homemade herbal preparations from the East of Spain are the witness of traditional medicine inherited from the ancient complex formulas of herbal teas and medicinal wines. In this study, we document the use of traditional alcoholic beverages, identify their ingredients, almost exclusively botanical, record the local medicinal uses of these mixtures, and discuss patterns of distribution of this knowledge in regions of eastern Spain, the Balearic Islands and Andorra. We determine marker species and relevant patterns of herbal formulas in the different regions of the territory. Homemade liquors and liqueurs are consumed for their digestive and tonic-restorative properties but they also play in some cases an important social role. The elderly remember other medicinal uses such as aperitif, emmenagogue, or antidiarrheal, for some of the most popular preparations. The herbal liqueur formulas include predominantly Lamiaceae, Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae, and Apiaceae species. Herbs (58%), fruits (28%), and mixtures of both (12%) are ingredients of liquors and wines, being the aerial parts the most frequent in terms of species (30%) and records (49%). Dictamnus hispanicus, Santolina villosa, Salvia blancoana subsp. mariolensis , Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, and Clinopodium serpyllifolium subsp. fruticosum are the species most frequently used. Others species used to a lesser extent as Polygonatum odoratum, Thymus moroderi, and Saxifraga longifolia are restricted to locally homemade preparations because their collection and uses require special knowledge of the rare or endemic flora. Sustainability of these practices is strongly limited by the overall loss of local traditional knowledge and by the limited availability of most of the wild species; some of them are endangered or threatened mainly by the loss of their natural habitats. Cultivation and domestication are a promising alternative to collecting from wild populations. The cultivation of Thymus moroderi in the province of Alicante and Polygonatum odoratum in the province of Teruel are good examples. There is a notable decrease in the complexity of the formulas registered throughout the nearly 15 years of the study. This is interpreted as a consequence of a loss of knowledge, less accessibility to wild resources, and changes in traditions and preferences.Homemade herbal preparations from the East of Spain are the witness of traditional medicine inherited from the ancient complex formulas of herbal teas and medicinal wines.

Abstract: Hospitals operate in a very knowledge-intensive environment where technologies change rapidly; therefore, information systems are pivotal in affording hospital leaders the opportunities to automate, create, and disseminate knowledge effectively. IT professionals are fundamental to successfully implementing and maintaining complex technology-based healthcare solutions. The purpose of this generic qualitative inquiry was to explore the KM strategies some acute care hospital IT managers use to mitigate the tacit knowledge loss of IT professionals. The participants selected for this study included IT managers in the United States and employed by acute care hospitals that possess a medical necessity hospital beds certification for 75 beds or more. The setting chosen for the participant interviews was a teleconference meeting using the Zoom VOIP (voice over internet protocol). This venue chosen eliminated the geographical constraints of the researcher and the participant. Data were collected using semistructured interviews from 10 full-time acute care hospital IT managers that supervised IT professionals and served in their current position for at least 2 years. The conceptual framework used was the SECI model. The SECI knowledge transfer and creation model are significant in determining the effectiveness of tacit knowledge management within an organization. Data were analyzed using NVivo 12 and Microsoft Excel to assist in identifying themes. The data analysis yielded four themes: socialization within the work environment, supportive corporate culture, motivators and rewards, and open communication. The findings will afford practitioners and scholars additional insights into the KM strategies hospital IT managers could utilize to preserve IT professionals’ tacit knowledge, resulting in increased productivity, enhanced capabilities, and improved organizational learning.

Abstract: This article presents a preliminary review of prior studies for an ongoing master's dissertation. It is aimed at enabling stakeholders to properly comprehend the construct of electronic learning (e-learning). E-learning is actually one of the most dynamic and enriching systems of education that exists these days. It is seen as a significant educational innovation, particularly within learning ecosystems of tertiary institutions that is found to be aiding the process of teaching and learning with technology. E-learning has further transformed educational technology, providing easy access to education for many, who hitherto were unable to go to school before the transformation. It is facilitating meaningful learning activities leading to knowledge retention and maximizing academic achievement, as learning is transferred into the real world of work and life. In this paper, the historical perspective of e-learning, operational definitions of the e-learning concept, some of the tools and platforms that support e-learning and its delivery modes are presented. Most importantly, the paper assesses the e-learning ecosystem in Nigeria's higher education sub-sector, articulates the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating e-learning into the educational arena, and then offers some recommendations to address the challenges.

Abstract: It was recently shown that novice medical students could be trained to demonstrate the speed-to-diagnosis and diagnostic accuracy typical of System-1-type reasoning. However, the effectiveness of this training can only be fully evaluated when considering the extent to which knowledge transfer and long-term retention occur as a result, the former of which is known to be notoriously difficult to achieve. This study aimed to investigate whether knowledge learned during an online training exercise for chest X-ray diagnosis promoted either knowledge transfer or retention, or both. Second year medical students were presented with, and trained to recognise the features of four chest X-ray conditions. Subsequently, they were shown the four trained-for cases again as well as different representations of the same conditions varying in the number of common elements and asked to provide a diagnosis, to test for near-transfer (four cases) and far-transfer (four cases) of knowledge. They were also shown four completely new conditions to diagnose. Two weeks later they were asked to diagnose the 16 aforementioned cases again to assess for knowledge retention. Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy and time-to-diagnosis. Thirty-six students volunteered. Trained-for cases were diagnosed most accurately and with most speed (mean score = 3.75/4, mean time = 4.95 s). When assessing knowledge transfer, participants were able to diagnose near-transfer cases more accurately (mean score = 2.08/4, mean time = 15.77 s) than far-transfer cases (mean score = 1.31/4, mean time = 18.80 s), which showed similar results to those conditions previously unseen (mean score = 0.72/4, mean time = 19.46 s). Retention tests showed a similar pattern but accuracy scores were lower overall. This study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully promote knowledge transfer and retention in Year 2 medical students, using an online training exercise involving diagnosis of chest X-rays, and is one of the few studies to provide evidence of actual knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Computer-based learning has numerous advantages. It gives students the chance to accommodate and solve problems independently, it can increase motivation during the learning process, and it offers students direct feedback. Students will also receive an authentic learning experience, increasing their level of knowledge retention. It can assist nursing educators in improving learning outcomes. Aim: This study aimed to investigate and evaluate the impact of computer-based scenarios on undergraduate nursing students’ decision-making skills. Sample: There was a total sample of 112 nursing students who were enrolled in a critical care nursing course at the College of Applied Medical Sciences in Saudi Arabia. These students were divided into two groups. Methods: The two groups were taught the same topic for one week. Two case scenarios were given to each group during the clinical rotation. The study group used the computer-based case scenario, and the control group used the paper-based case scenario. The two groups were compared regarding their decision-making skills. The student’s feedback about the computer-based case scenarios was also investigated. Results: The study group scored significantly higher in their decision-making skills when compared to the control group. In addition, the study group reported that they highly agreed that their general learning and specific nursing abilities improved after using computer-based case scenarios.

Abstract: Training and education of real-world tasks in Virtual Reality (VR) has seen growing use in industry. The motion-tracking data that is intrinsic to immersive VR applications is rich and can be used to improve learning beyond standard training interfaces. In this paper, we present machine learning (ML) classifiers that predict outcomes from a VR training application. Our approach makes use of the data from the tracked head-mounted display (HMD) and handheld controllers during VR training to predict whether a user will exhibit high or low knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and performance retention. We evaluated six different sets of input features and found varying degrees of accuracy depending on the predicted outcome. By visualizing the tracking data, we determined that users with higher acquisition and retention outcomes made movements with more certainty and with greater velocities than users with lower outcomes. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to develop VR training applications that dynamically adapt to a user by using commonly available tracking data to predict learning and retention outcomes.

Abstract: Background Information learned over a longer period of time has been shown to result in better long-term knowledge retention than information learned over a shorter period of time. In order to address multiple curricular goals, the timing and spacing of anatomy content within the Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program at our institution recently changed from a very spaced to a very compressed format. The purpose of the present study was to assess differences in anatomy knowledge retention that might have been impacted by this change. The research hypothesis was that students receiving spaced instruction would have significantly better anatomy knowledge retention than students receiving massed instruction. Methods Participants consisted of two cohorts of DPT students that both received 45 contact hours of anatomy lecture and 90 contact hours of anatomy lab. The LONG cohort experienced anatomy through a lecture and lab taught over a 30-week, 2 semester period as separate courses. In contrast, the SHORT cohort took their anatomy lecture and lab concurrently over one 10-week semester. A pre-test was administered on the first day of their anatomy lecture course, and a post-test was administered to each cohort 18 months after completion of their last anatomy exam. Results After controlling for age-related differences in the two groups, no significant differences in mean pre-test, post-test, or percentage improvement were found between cohorts ( p  = 0.516; 0.203; and 0.152, respectively). Conclusion These findings refute the hypothesis and show that both spaced and massed instruction in these cohorts resulted in the same level of long-term anatomy knowledge retention.

Abstract: Background Active learning improves learner engagement and knowledge retention. The application of continuous quality improvement methodologies, such as the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) framework, may be useful for optimizing medical education, including active learning sessions. We aimed to enhance student satisfaction and achievement of learning outcomes by applying the PDSA framework to an antibiotic utilization curriculum for medical students. Methods Guided by the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework, between February 2017 and July 2019, we developed, implemented, and revised an active learning session for medical students, focused on appropriate utilization of antibiotics during their Internal Medicine clerkship. Results Across twelve sessions, 367 students (83.4%) completed the post-evaluation survey. Although baseline ratings were high (97% of respondents enjoyed the “active learning” format), constructive comments informed iterative improvements to the session, such as modifying session timing, handouts and organization of the gaming component. Intervention 3, the last improvement cycle, resulted in more favorable ratings for the active learning format ( p  = 0.015) improvement in understanding antibiotics and their clinical application ( p  = 0.001) compared to Baseline ratings. Conclusions This intervention suggests that active learning, with regular incorporation of student feedback vis-à-vis a PDSA cycle, was effective in achieving high student engagement in an Internal Medicine core clerkship session on antibiotic therapy. Iterative interventions based on student feedback, such as providing an antibiotic reference table and answer choices for each case, further improved student receptivity and perceived educational value. The study findings have potential implications for medical education and suggest that the application of the PDSA cycle can optimize active learning pedagogies and outcomes.

Abstract: Background In the last few decades, the need to change the curriculum of basic medical science has been further emphasized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of teaching integrated course of physical examination and radiological anatomy in practical limb anatomy on medical students’ learning outcomes. Methods This was an experimental study. Medical students (of the 4th semester of medical education) were divided into intervention and control groups. Related topics of physical examination and radiological anatomy were added to the practical limb anatomy courses of the intervention group. Practical knowledge of anatomy, clinical applications of anatomical knowledge, students ‘satisfaction, and students’ attitude toward the anatomy course were assessed at the end of the study. Knowledge retention was assessed three months after the semester. Results The intervention group scored significantly higher mean scores in practical knowledge of anatomy test, clinical applications of anatomical knowledge test and knowledge retention test (P-value < 0.05). In evaluating students’ satisfaction with the course, the intervention group was satisfied with the course and teacher performance and had appropriate attitude (Mean˃4, Max score = 5) towards the application of anatomy in medicine. Conclusions The findings of this study showed that teaching practical anatomy with a clinical integrated approach can improve the practical knowledge of anatomy, knowledge retention, and clinical applications of anatomical knowledge. In addition, an integrated approach was associated with greater student satisfaction and it makes students have appropriate attitude towards the application of anatomy in medicine.

Gesturing to the Past: The Case for an Ethnography of Melanesian Poetics

Abstract: The driving theme of this article is the loss of poetics in the language of the Vula'a people of southeastern Papua New Guinea, in particular the relationship between language loss and knowledge loss-the type of knowledge that connects people to ancestors and is central to a group's identity. Drawing on examples from my fieldwork, I argue for the value of an ethnography of poetic language and for rethinking approaches to the study of Indigenous languages beyond instances when endangerment is imminent. My approach is influenced by Martin Heidegger and sits comfortably with recent theoretical perspectives that draw on the work of Edward S Casey (1996) and Tim Ingold (2000). Poetic language is not only prevalent in immediately recognizable genres; it also plays a significant role in many other oral traditions as well as in day-to-day life. Consequently, there is a pressing need to pay attention to disappearing poetic forms if we are to comprehend past and present lifeworlds. To this end, we should not be distracted by models that would reduce language to types of expression or to component parts. After presenting examples from my own research, I explore the work of other Melanesian ethnographers to reveal the relationship between poetic language, place, and Indigenous ways of knowing.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 30th Annual Conference of the European Association for Education in Electrical and Information Engineering (EAEEIE) Conference Start Date: 2021, Sept. 1 Conference End Date: 2021, Sept. 4 Conference Location: Prague, Czech Republic The world has witnessed an exponential development of digital technology with the advent of connected objects and the Internet of Things. All economic sectors are affected, leading to the fourth industrial revolution, called “Industry 4.0”, which all industrialized countries are seeking to develop. In parallel, the global evolution of the microelectronics industry has strongly evolved during the last 20 years, towards mass production in the far East. The European companies have thus oriented their activities towards design without manufacturing. This evolution if it seemed economically interesting has led to the loss of knowledge and especially knowhow at the European level, namely at the French one. In a situation of economic and sanitary crisis, supply difficulties have resulted in the definition of a strategy to boost production that is the goal of the new national recovery plan. In this context, it is necessary to build new plants but also to have the skills and know-how. The training of engineers, masters and technicians is of utmost importance. After having detailed the context and the needs manifested by the electronics and microelectronics sector, this paper deals with the approach of the national microelectronics training network to face these challenges which are as well French as European.11This work is financially supported by the French Ministry of Higher Education. Several realizations were obtained in the frame of the project IDEFI-FINMINA: by the IDEFI-FINMINA project, ANR-11-IDFI-0017.

Training Canadian seminarians in empathy

Abstract: Acknowledged as a vital skill both within and outside the counseling relationship, the influence of empathy on society is becoming well-established. Its benefits include positive impacts on the helping relationship, greater prosocial activities, positive character traits, and a decrease in negative behaviors. Its usage is also encouraged by the Catholic Church, particularly the writings of Pope Francis. While its benefits are recognized, recent observations show a marked downward trend in empathy among emerging adults (Millennials and Generation Z). Such declines are worrisome not only for the identified cohorts, but for the church and society as a whole. Despite such trends, little is done in Canada to educate English Catholic seminarians in the early stages of formation in both empathy and various pastoral issues. To address this need, an empathy seminar, educating seminarians in the early stages of formation, was proposed. The seminar used didactic and skills training which provided seminarians with a basic theoretical framework on both empathy and six pastoral challenges: culture, abortion, same-sex attraction, domestic violence, gender dysphoria, and separation and divorce. The seminar took place over a three-day period (15 hours) in September 2020, with 27participants. A range of evaluation tools, including the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), post-seminar survey, and interviews, were implemented. The evaluation tools showed a slight increase in empathy and knowledge retention among participants. The TEQ showed a mean score of 46.84in the pre-seminar survey, and a post-seminar result of 47.76, indicating above-average empathy among seminarians. A paired t-test (two-tailed p value of .1701) indicated that the difference for the overall sample was not statistically significant, which given the limited sample size is not surprising; however, it is worth noting that the sample size (25 participants) represents approximately 19% of the total English Canadian seminarian population in 2020. In the post-session interviews, seminarians found the seminar worthwhile; however, they felt changes could occur. While the seminar will not provide a complete long-term solution to empathic needs of emerging adults in the seminary, it does help to begin the conversation on how this need can be addressed in Canadian English seminaries moving forward.

The effects of knowledge retention, self-confidence, and anxiety levels associated with peer-assisted learning in a healthcare course

Abstract: In the United States, 350,000+ fatalities are due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (CPR Certification HQ, 2018). If patients do not receive quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within the first few minutes of the attack, they will perish. According to the American Heart Association (2019b), healthcare (HC) providers have reduced CPR knowledge in as little as three months from being certificated (American CPR, 2019). Based on these facts, it is imperative that HC providers retain CPR knowledge for quality care. Faculty are attempting to find the best way to teach life-saving skills to the younger generations. One strategy that is being incorporated is peer-assisted learning (PAL). The purpose of this study was to investigate how a PAL community would affect undergraduate pre-professional HC students' skill effectiveness and knowledge retention in learning CPR, as well as their confidence and anxiety levels when performing this task; it focused only on the effects gained by the peer learner.Part One of this study evaluated a 15 question Pre-and Post-CPR Simulation survey for internal consistency and variable grouping via exploratory factor analysis. Part Two compared the effectiveness of two learning conditions examined among undergraduate pre-professional HC students. An objective effectiveness score was collected via mannequin-based testing; each learning environment's scores were analyzed and compared using a MANOVA analysis. A Pre-and Post-CPR Simulation survey was administered to determine confidence and anxiety. Pre-CPR Simulation questions were measured using a repeated-measures ANOVA test, while Post-CPR Simulation questions were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test. The Pre-and Post-CPR Simulation survey was considered internally consistent; however, it did not have three factors emerge during the factor analysis and varimax rotation as previously published. In Part Two, there was no significant findings in mannequin variables or the pre-and post-surveys between learning environments. The sole significant result was a survey question stating that students felt more knowledgeable with performing CPR over time; this was noted in both environments. This research adds to current PAL research that focuses exclusively on the peer learner rather than the peer tutor. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: Introdução: A parada cardíaca (PC) é um grave problema de saúde pública e uma das principais causas de morte em todo o mundo. De acordo com a American Heart Association (AHA), o suporte básico de vida (SBV) é a base para melhorar a sobrevivência das pessoas após uma parada cardiorrespiratória e a ressuscitação cardiopulmonar é um aspecto crucial. Por meio de evidências científicas, capacitar os profissionais de saúde com foco na educação em ressuscitação é fundamental para identificar e atender uma vítima de parada cardíaca. No Brasil, faltam dados que avaliem o conhecimento em SBV de estudantes de ciências da saúde. Este estudo analisou a retenção de conhecimento de estudantes de Enfermagem, Fisioterapia e Medicina, após um ano de realização de uma palestra-demonstração sobre SBV. Método: Estudo longitudinal. Estudantes de graduação em ciências da saúde que participaram da coleta de dados e responderam a um questionário baseado no SBV seguindo as diretrizes da AHA. Os dados foram recolhidos durante dois anos consecutivos, em três momentos distintos (uma avaliação, um teste após a aula e um teste de avaliação um ano após a aula). Resultados: O grupo melhorou sua pontuação após a palestra sobre SBV; o número de acertos dobrou (p <0,001); no entanto, um ano depois, essa pontuação diminuiu significativamente (p <0,001). Conclusão: Não houve retenção de conhecimento após um ano de uma aula-demonstrativa sobre SBV em estudantes de ciências da saúde. Alternate abstract: Background: Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) is a severe public health problem and a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), basic life support (BLS) is the bedrock for improving people's survival after a cardiac arrest, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation is crucial. Through scientific evidence, empowering health professionals focuses on education in resuscitation is vital to identify and attend a CPA victim. In Brazil, there is a lack of data that evaluates the BLS knowledge of health science students . This study analyzed the knowledge retention of medicine, nursing, and physiotherapy students after one year of having a lecture-demonstration on BLS. Method: Longitudinal study. Undergraduate students of health science participated in the data collection and answered a questionnaire based on BLS following AHA guidelines. Data were collected during two consecutive years, in three different moments (an assessment, a test after a lecture, and an assessment test one year later). Results: The group improved its score after the class on BLS; the number of correct answers doubled (p <0.001); however, one year later, that score decreased significantly (p <0.001). Conclusion: No retention of knowledge in health sciences students after a year of a lecture-demonstration on BLS.

Abstract: Background The use and knowledge of medicinal plants play an essential role in community health in rural Mexico. Medicinal plants are part of the local heritage and provide a source of economic income. Nevertheless, knowledge of their use has declined due to factors like accelerated urbanization. Some authors have proposed that by reducing natural spaces, urbanization generates changes that impact the recognition, use, and management of natural resources. Here, we evaluate how urbanization affects the knowledge, use, and perception of medicinal plants in a Biosphere Reserve in Mexico. Methods Using a mixed methodology including quantitative and qualitative analyses, we generated a list of medicinal plants, methods of preparation, prevalence of illness, and use in two communities with different degrees of urbanization. Results A total of 217 medicinal plants were identified. The more urbanized community had greater knowledge of, and used, a larger number of introduced plant species, while the less urbanized community used and had more knowledge about wild plants. One of the factors explaining these differences was occupation, with people who work outdoors showing greater knowledge of wild plants. Conclusions Urbanization can lead to a loss of knowledge of the use and management of local wild species, with implications for the conservation of biocultural heritage. Substitution of native medicinal plants by introduced species shows disinterest and disuse in the local medicinal flora, which could be reflected in their ecosystems.

Abstract: As the increasing availability and use of dynamic mobile communications, information from an Internet of Things (IoT) subset of devices, known as Internet of Connected Vehicles (IoCV), is collected with a level of uncertainty. To bridge this gap of data analytics, some studies take two factors individually to mine knowledge or information, such as uncertainty and utility as two exemplary factors. However, this approach may cause actual loss of knowledge integrity. In this work, our first result is a knowledge called H igh E xpected U tility S equential P atterns (HEUSPs) that is both novel and also provides an alternative option for knowledge discovery regarding utility and uncertainty factors by a single threshold in IoCV environments. Furthermore, two PUL-Chain and EUL-Chain structures with six pruning methodologies are respectively developed to maintain information that is necessary and reduce the search space for improving mining performance. Our experimental results show both efficiency and strength of the designed algorithm compared to HUS-Span which is considered to be the current standard in utility-oriented sequential pattern mining.

Gamification in nursing literature: an integrative review

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/gamification-nursing-literature-integrative/docview/2560125686/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Objective Gamification is an increasingly popular instructional strategy in nursing. The purpose of this integrative review is to explore gamification as it has been applied in nursing literature. This integrative review seeks to ask the question – What aspects of gamification have been explored in nursing literature and what aspects require further exploration? Method Whittemore, R., & Knafl, K. (2005). The integrative review: Updated methodology. Methodological Issues in Nursing Research , 52(5), 546–553 integrative review framework guided this review. Seventeen articles were reviewed and a quality appraisal tool (developed by Hawker, S., Payne, S., Kerr, C., Hardey, M., & Powell, J. (2002). Appraising the evidence: Reviewing disparate data systematically. Qualitative Health Research , 12(9), 1284–1299) was also used to evaluate the articles. Results Following the data analysis stage outlined in Whittemore and Knafl’s integrative review framework, six themes emerged: construct conceptualization; relationship between engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge retention; knowledge translation, motivation, role of technology, and gamification elements. Conclusion Gamification is of interest to the nursing profession. More study is needed to better ascertain the relationship between gamification and several of the main themes identified in this review.

Abstract: Individuals knowledge activity is essential for knowledge circulation in organizations. To examine the relationship between knowledge-based psychological ownership and knowledge hiding, we conducted a three-wave online survey with 310 knowledge workers in China. We used the bootstrapping method for mediation effects analysis and found that loss of knowledge power mediated the effect of knowledge-based psychological ownership on knowledge hiding. The results of a conditional process analysis further indicate that emotional intelligence attenuated the indirect impact of knowledge-based psychological ownership on knowledge hiding through the mediator of loss of knowledge power. Our findings enhance understanding of why workers refuse to share their knowledge, and how to decrease knowledge-hiding behaviors in organizations by developing employees emotional competency.

Abstract: Risk management business leaders face eminent knowledge loss from retiring senior leaders if written succession strategies are not in place. Grounded in the organizational knowledge creation theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the succession strategies used by risk management leaders to retain tacit knowledge from retiring senior leaders. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with five risk management leaders in Florida, organizational succession plans, and reports from organizational knowledge transfer programs. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged: organizational knowledge transfer, knowledge management-succession planning, knowledge retention, and generational knowledge transfer. A key recommendation is for risk management business leaders to develop written succession plans using mentoring and knowledge transfer tools while considering the succeeding junior leaders' expectations. The implications for positive social change include the potential for organizational sustainability of risk management operations, increasing local economies through leadership development, and job sustainability.

Abstract: The gap between the number of available STEM workers and employers' needs in the workforce is projected to be about two million by 2025. One way to reduce the magnitude of this gap is to increase the number of entry-level STEM workers joining the workforce, however the attrition rate for college STEM majors is about 33%. Research has indicated that students' study strategies and affective factors are related to student retention.This qualitative case study explored the study strategies of students using adaptive learning technology in a gateway STEM class, General Chemistry. The researcher sought to understand how the students describe their transfer of learning outside of the course adaptive learning environment to course assessments and laboratory work in their own voices, using semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion. Understanding the study strategies used by students, whose expectations of knowledge transfer are in alignment with their assessments and laboratory work, may lead to identifying interventions that may assist other students in more successfully transferring their knowledge and aid in their retention in STEM fields of study.The overarching research question was, "What study strategies do General Chemistry students describe using in the adaptive learning environment that impact successful knowledge transfer to assessments and laboratory work in the General Chemistry class?" The conceptual framework informing this study was built on sociocultural and self-determination theories, and three streams of literature: the shortage in the STEM workforce, factors affecting STEM students' knowledge retention, and adaptive learning environments in higher education were reviewed. The findings in this study led to four results among the participants using the adaptive learning environment for homework assignments in General Chemistry: personalized learning strategies were utilized by the participants in General Chemistry at the College to learn new content, personalized study strategies were employed by the participants in General Chemistry at the College in preparation for assessments, responsibility for the development of the participants' study strategies was placed on themselves, and the sentiment of the adaptive learning environment in transfer of learning was generally positive.The recommendations emanating from this study include sharing the results of this study with professors and administrators at the College using or considering adaptive learning environments, encouraging professors to conduct study strategy sessions with their classes early in each semester, encouraging the faculty to use data analytics from adaptive learning environments to determine if specific students need study strategy coaching, and conducting this study with a screening criterion which includes learners who are not self-directed in the development of their study strategies, so that the data may be compared to the findings of this study.

Abstract: This study analyzed the effects of the jigsaw technique versus traditional lecturing methods on 9th and 10th grade students’ knowledge retention on an English class comma’s unit. The research study consisted of two 9th grade classes and two 10th grade classes comprising 91 students. A quasi-experimental design was used in this study to determine if there were significant differences in pretest and posttest scores of students receiving the jigsaw method of instruction versus students receiving the traditional lecturing method of instruction. Quantitative data were collected using a researcher-created assessment. Data collected was used to determine which method of instruction increased students’ knowledge retention.

Outside-In and Inside-Out: In-Between Spaces as Social and Spatial Connectors

Abstract: Embedded within the history and identity of the fashion industry is a tension between the temporal, fleeting, and virtual nature of its contemporary practices and the deeply rooted tradition, craft, and social value of its cultural spaces of production. The shift to fully digitalized workflows from traditional design and manufacturing processes has had an effect on the quality and value of the product,1and has resulted in a loss of connection to its craft. The process of fashion production and retail is fragmented, dispersed among disparate locations, or in-between the real and the virtual. Retail stores no longer need storefronts, the majority of manufacturing is exported, and centers of distribution are separated from spaces of production. This thesis argues that physical proximity and awareness of the social and cultural value of the traditional craft is integral to the resiliency of the fashion industry and proposes activating interstitial space within the historic Garment Center of New York to foster collaboration and enable awareness of its place identity. The Garment Center in New York has a rich history of fashion production, from the early 1920s to the 1960s, with approximately90% of the garments made in the USA coming out of its studios, factories, and warehouses. While the Garment Center continues to exist as a historic space of production in NYC, less than 3% of US garment production is sourced out of its 6 block radius today.2 The displacement of goods, culture, and manufacturing from their origins in the contemporary fashion industry has disrupted the community that exists around the Garment Center and has also reduced the environmental and social sustainability of the industry.3At risk, is the loss of knowledge, loss of skilled labor, and loss of a sense of place that is an integral part of the history of fashion in New York City. The Garment District now occupies a liminal space in the industry, caught between its past and present identities, its virtual and physical outlets, and its shifting social and cultural values. Synonymous to the in-between, or the interstice is a spatial condition that suggests a middle location between two contrasting programs.4 Interstitiality facilitates proximity and has been written about at various scales from urban to interior design. In urban design, it is viewed as a space of opportunity and collaboration, whereas, in the interior, it is viewed as an ambiguous spatial connector. This project seeks to build upon the in-between nature of the Garment District by reimagining its interstitial spaces to foster proximity between public and private space, front-end and back-end programs, and blur the boundaries that exist between the different stages of fashion production. The network of satellite programs installed in urban interstices intends to embed the culture of making into the social fabric of the city, while facilitating proximity between the public, the garment industry, and its culture, as a way to increase awareness. The satellite programs connect back to the main hub located within the garment district. Programmatically, the main hub is a fashion incubator, that serves as an experimental platform to explore ethical and sustainable fashion design, while paying homage to the traditional craft. It is imagined as a microcosm of the city, as well as the historical landscape of the garment center, and is designed as a porous interior-exterior condition. The existing programs adjacent to site overlap with programs of the incubator, creating a series of interstitial hybridized programs. Physically and programmatically connecting the adjacent programs to the site helps ground the design in its context, while activating relationships and opportunities for collaboration. Historically, the streetscape of the Garment District was the centre of activity, being the space of circulation, of transfer of goods, and of commerce. The sidewalk remains the most active interstitial condition in the urban landscape. The streetscape from the exterior is internalized (Figure 1.1), to weave through different programs, while connecting, activating, and facilitating proximities. This interstitial artery of the building morphs in form and atmosphere as it gains proximity to different programs. The programs that line the interior street form storefront conditions that are activated and deactivated at different times of the day, mirroring the dynamic interaction that occurs in the exterior. These interstitial hybridized moments aim to create a socio-culturally active interior-exterior space that celebrates the history of the Garment district, traditional craft, and culture of making. They are seen as a series of vignettes, activated to facilitate collaboration, awareness, and create a deep-rooted sense of place to combat the displacement of an industry from within.

Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has a wide variety of potentials for education. Especially 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos can provide immersive educational experiences of otherwise not accessible real-world environments. But what potential do 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos in VR and real VR settings have for teaching? Research into the use of real VR, providing live-learning experience in the classroom is still scarce, which is why this article investigates this issue in the context of a systematic review. We discuss use cases, advantages, and limitations as well as interaction characteristics of the potential of 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos, and also the promises of real VR scenarios. By analyzing 64 articles in-depth, our results suggest that 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos can be used for a wide variety of topics. While only a few articles report technological benefits, there are indicators that 360$^{\circ }$∘ videos can benefit learning processes in terms of performance, motivation, and knowledge retention. Most papers report positive effects on other human factors such as presence, perception, engagement, emotions, and empathy. Furthermore, an open research gap has been identified in use cases for real VR.

Abstract: Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma and the second-leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Although timely diagnosis and proper adherence to therapeutic regimen prevent blindness, patient nonadherence continues to be the greatest challenge to effective treatment. Preliminary research suggested that culturally interactive education delivery may increase patient adherence. However, this education intervention had not occurred with glaucoma treatment. The transtheoretical model of behavior change served as the framework for this study. The research questions addressed the effect that glaucoma education provided by a culturally competent patient navigator had on patient knowledge of glaucoma, adherence to medication use, and follow-up appointment attendance. This quantitative study had a longitudinal design with archival data from 206 Russian Eastern European immigrant patients. The control group had a standard appointment with an ophthalmologist, and the experimental group had an interactive educational experience with a patient navigator after the standard appointment. The navigator administered the Glaucoma Knowledge Index at three time points: before the appointment (T1), after the appointment (T2), and at a 1-month follow-up (T3). The intervention group showed a statistically significant increase in glaucoma knowledge retention at T2 and T3. However, this increase in knowledge did not correspond to a statistically significant difference in patients' adherence to follow-up eye exam attendance or ocular medication adherence. The outcome of this study may form the basis for discussions among policymakers leading to positive social change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: Association questions (AQs) are a novel form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). To answer an AQ, learners must recall the concepts denoted by the given terms, affirm their connections, and then select the term with a denotation that is "less connected" with other concepts. This research hypothesizes that the use of AQ tests for reviewing course contents can significantly help learners to assimilate and/or accommodate what was covered in class and to store the resulting cognitive structures in long-term memory (LTM). To test this hypothesis, an educational experiment was conducted. The results showed that the use of optional online AQ tests for reviewing course contents helped with knowledge retention and was especially suitable for learners with medium levels of initial knowledge. AQs are easy to answer and grade. Therefore, it should be worthwhile to use AQ tests for formative assessment whenever AQs can be designed to help learners better understand course contents.

Abstract: Multimedia in blended learning provides the ability to enhance students' performance and satisfaction. Microlectures are one type of multimedia that comprise of short modular videos that introduce basic theoretical concepts. Literature provides limited insight into how this specific format supports engineering classrooms. This study, therefore, explored what the benefit of flipped microlecture classes is for students in a course with mainly traditional face-to-face lectures. To this end, we allocated ten students to a flipped microlecture and twelve to a traditional lecture setting; conducted pre and post-tests; and, organised a focus group. Results show a positive effect of the flipped microlecture class on the test performance. Students' qualitative evaluations also indicate their satisfaction with increased control over learning, reduced discomfort of traditional lecture settings, enhanced classroom interaction, and better knowledge retention. These findings resonate with blended learning and multimedia literature and support future decision making about microlectures in engineering education.

Abstract: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV experience challenges with retention in care, which negatively affects viral suppression. To address this, researchers piloted Bijou, a program designed to provide health education through electronically delivered behavior and risk reduction modules. Participants were 29 YMSM aged 19-24 living with HIV from the southeastern US. Participants completed pre, post, and 3-month follow-up (3MFU) surveys assessing knowledge, intervention acceptability, satisfaction, self-efficacy, ehealth literacy, and usability. Findings revealed significant improvement in knowledge and e-health literacy from pre-test to post-test but lost significance at 3MFU. Self-efficacy scores did not show significant differences from pre-test to post-test or 3MFU. Participants who completed all modules considered Bijou usable and acceptable; however, many did not complete the program. Findings suggest a need for adaptations to promote knowledge retention, e-health literacy, engagement over time, and research with a larger, more representative sample.Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV experience challenges with retention in care, which negatively affects viral suppression.

Abstract: CPR training with a near-peer group had a positive impact on student knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and learning satisfaction. [...]this method may be a useful way to conduct such training workshops. Introduction Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is one of the greatest inventions in the history of medicine as an immediate intervention in preventing or delaying death in individuals experiencing sudden cardiac arrest.1 The ideal outcome of a resuscitation operation is to fully return the patient to life.2 Since 1960, when Kouwenhoven performed CPR with cardiac massage for the first time, there have been many improvements in the method, drugs used, and skill training of the medical staff; however, the mortality rate following cardiac arrest remains high compared with other events.1 Rescuing a patient from a cardiac arrest requires three principal components: medical knowledge, effective education, and correct execution, all of which demonstrate the importance of training in rescuing the patient.3 When a patient is hovering between life and death, efficient and knowledgeable staff must be present at his/her bedside.4 Various studies have noted the importance of resuscitation in a patient with cardiac arrest by the first individuals to arrive at the scene.5,6 The important point is that their information must always be up-to-date, meaning that the resuscitator must learn and then hone their skills continually.7 Although proficiency in resuscitation is essential for health care professionals, some studies have found that physicians, medical staff, and students lack the required knowledge and skills in this area.5 9 It is worth noting that an important goal is improving the quality of CPR training. In other words, academically, near peers have more clinical experience than the students with whom they are grouped.1214 The difference between near-peers and tutor-peers is their educational level.9,15 It is believed that since near peers have experience being at the same level as the current students, they are more familiar with their educational needs and thus can better understand the students' learning processes and possible areas of confusion.16 One advantages of this approach includes participation on the part of the individuals themselves in their education, which leads to increased accountability, easier information transfer, and even cost savings.17 The workshop method has been commonly used for training CPR skills since 1941.1 The results of various studies have shown the positive effect of this method on enhancing knowledge and skills of participants in learning CPR.1,7 Therefore, taking into account the benefits of the near-peer method, the researchers in the present study examined the effect of conducting CPR workshops using the near-peer method on learning, knowledge retention, and satisfaction of students in various medical fields. [...]the spherical hypothesis was examined by the Mauchly's Sphericity test. Since the sphericity hypothesis was not established at P< 0.001, the Greenhouse-Geisser test was used to evaluate the effect trend.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 7th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN) Conference Start Date: 2021, May 17 Conference End Date: 2021, June 10 Conference Location: Eureka, CA, USA Curriculum size constantly challenges healthcare education and training. Technology enhanced, immersive educational content like Virtual, Augmented, or Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR collectively XR) constantly aims to facilitate knowledge retention and skills acquisition in the healthcare sector. Core challenge in this effort is the increasing costs, in time and resources, required for designing and developing XR immersive educational content. An approach to address this challenge is participatory design methods. Co-creation approaches distribute the burden of content development amongst the educators' community and facilitate decentralized bottoms-up content creation. This approach requires data modeling approaches that facilitate digital asset discoverability, reusability and consumption through visual authoring tools. This work describes the conceptualization and implementation of a UX taxonomy for annotating immersive AR/VR/MR content at the asset level for maximum repurposing capacity. A brainstorming session between educational and technology experts was conducted and conceptual details of the terms of the taxonomy were described. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabulary was utilized to organize this devised taxonomy and link it with existing medical ontology terms, formulating an RDF endpoint of the nominated ENTICE ontology. This ontology was able to link medical terms with UX and educational properties in a data structure that can annotate and contextually encapsulate any XR digital asset. An example such term is described and presented as proof of application. The semantic modelling implemented in this work is directly applicable to a previously proposed visual data structure and subsequent authoring environment that could facilitate XR resource design and authoring from non-technical experts.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 7th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN) Conference Start Date: 2021, May 17 Conference End Date: 2021, June 10 Conference Location: Eureka, CA, USA A new perspective on using media in the classroom that started to rise in the past few years is immersive learning. This paper considers the learning success of children on the subject of organology and assesses the question, if a virtual environment on the tale “Peter and the Wolf” can support knowledge retention of primary school students relating to various instruments' sound, appearance, hearing impression and groups. In a first pilot study for evaluating this educational virtual environment, eight children filled out a questionnaire before and after the immersive experience. The findings indicate that the environment on the topic of “Peter and the Wolf” could have a positive effect on knowledge retention for fundamental aspects of organology. These first findings for using virtual environments in Music Education encourage the further investigation of using immersive media for teaching and learning in the subject Music.

Abstract: Virtual training platform allows interactive and engaging learning through practice without exposing trainees to hazards. In the recent pandemic (COVID-19) situation, online training is gaining importance as it allows learning with social distancing. This research study develops two online training modes—slide-based and virtual world—and assesses them on factors such as knowledge retention, engagement, and attention. Fire safety and emergency evacuation procedures were selected for online training development, focusing on a university community. A Lean Startup methodology was employed to develop training content for virtual and slide-based safety training (SBST). A virtual university building was developed with 15 learning objectives on fire safety. An empirical evaluation of the training modes was conducted with 143 participants. The results validated that a Virtual Safety World (VSW) can provide the same knowledge as SBST but can do so in a more engaging manner. Retention of concepts after a month was higher in VSW participants. The participants’ attention levels, measured by employing qEEG, showed that participants exhibited better-sustained attention while in VSW than in SBST mode. In addition, initial studies of the virtual training platform, designed to be adaptive to the user, are performed using deep learning and qEEG.

Active Wild Food Practices among Culturally Diverse Groups in the 21st Century across Latgale, Latvia

Publication info: Prūse, Baiba; Simanova, Andra; Mežaka, Ieva; Raivo Kalle; Prakofjewa, Julia; et al. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/active-wild-food-practices-among-culturally/docview/2544577896/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Simple Summary A study in the bordering region of Latvia took place in order to investigate wild plant food uses. In total 72 interviewees reported food uses. The most represented uses of recorded plants were recreational tea; for jam; as snacks and soup; and drink. Interviewees also reported loss of foraging practice due to the habitat change as for example in case of caraway and chamomile. The results indicated that part of the reason for the main use of wild plants were linked to diet diversification. Abstract Local ecological knowledge (LEK), including but not limited to the use of wild food plants, plays a large role in sustainable natural resource management schemes, primarily due to the synergy between plants and people. There are calls for the study of LEK in culturally diverse areas due to a loss of knowledge, the active practice of utilizing wild plants in various parts of the world, and a decline in biodiversity. An ethnobotanical study in a border region of Latvia, characterised by diverse natural landscapes and people with deep spiritual attachments to nature, provided an opportunity for such insight, as well as the context to analyse wild food plant usages among different sociocultural groups, allowing us to explore the differences among these groups. Semi-structured interviews were carried out as part of a wider ethnobotanical field study to obtain information about wild food plants and their uses. The list of wild food plant uses, derived from 72 interviews, revealed a high level of homogenisation (in regards to knowledge) among the study groups, and that many local uses of wild food plants are still actively practiced. People did not gather plants as a recreational activity but rather as a source of diet diversification. The results provide evidence of the importance of safeguarding ecological and cultural diversity due to high local community dependency on natural resources.

Abstract: For ORT to have a maximum impact on public health it should be used in the community, in the home. A number of programs have been developed over the years to extend ORT to home use. One of the most successful approaches was the Oral Therapy Education Program (OTEP) developed by BRAC, the world’s largest NGO. Mothers were taught in the home by an OTEP worker using seven simple messages and a demonstration. The program, which led to high levels of use and knowledge retention, is described. What the OTEP and other successful home-based programs have demonstrated is that home care of diarrhea using ORS can be effectively implemented and can have a positive impact on the reduction of diarrhea morbidity and mortality.

Abstract: Background: Online spaced education (OSE) is a method recognized for promoting long-term knowledge retention, changing behaviors and improving outcomes for students and healthcare professionals. However, there is little evidence about its impacts on patient education. Objectives: The aim of this research was to compare knowledge retention using educational brochure and OSE on individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to verify the impact of educational methods on fall outcome. Methods: Individuals with MS (n = 230) were randomly assigned to two types of patient education-educational brochure (control) and OSE (intervention). During 12 weeks, the intervention group received multiple-choice tests on fall prevention. Knowledge retention, behavior change and fall incidence were assessed before intervention and after 3 and 6 months. The participants' satisfaction with the education method was also evaluated. Results: Knowledge retention was similar between groups, and behavior change was observed in both groups. There was a significant reduction in fall rate in the intervention group, from 0.60 to 0.27 at 6 months (P < 0.001). Participants' satisfaction achieved an average of 8.75, with no differences between groups. Conclusion: Individuals demonstrated significant improvement in fall rate outcome in both groups with no significant difference. In regard to test scores and satisfaction, results were similar between groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Knowledge is a valuable asset, and managing that knowledge is now recognized as a significant contributor to organizations in the current business climate. The problem is that the loss of knowledge impacts project quality, organizational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Too often, managers do not adequately communicate the knowledge retention strategies needed to reduce the impact of knowledge loss on project productivity. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore knowledge retention strategies to prevent knowledge loss in project-based organizations. The knowledge-based view of the firm and intellectual capital formed the conceptual framework. Eight participants consisting of managers, full-time employees, and consultants participated in the study. Data collection included semi-structured interviews using Zoom video teleconferencing software. Data analysis involved using two cycles of descriptive, pattern and focused coding to develop emerging codes and themes. This study revealed three themes: knowledge retention benefits, knowledge retention challenges, and knowledge retention strategies. This study's findings may help management develop and implement a knowledge retention strategy to identify, capture, and retain critical knowledge in their organization. The implication for positive social change may include organizations creating a positive workplace that influences employees to share and retain knowledge, increasing an organization's knowledge repository.

Abstract: Study habits have been the most significant indicator of academic performance and play a unique role in students' academic accomplishment. The study is aiming to determine the most common study habits of highly successful medical students and their relation to academic achievement. BACKGROUND Study habits have been the most significant indicator of academic performance and play a unique role in students' academic accomplishment. The study is aiming to determine the most common study habits of highly successful medical students and their relation to academic achievement.A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from September to December 2019 among medical students of both gender from six medical colleges in Saudi Arabia. The students answered the standardized questionnaires to study the different learning habits among medical students, including learning prioritization, knowledge retention strategies, motivation, daily hours of studying, study learning resources. METHODS A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from September to December 2019 among medical students of both gender from six medical colleges in Saudi Arabia. The students answered the standardized questionnaires to study the different learning habits among medical students, including learning prioritization, knowledge retention strategies, motivation, daily hours of studying, study learning resources.Six hundred and seventy-five medical students enrolled themselves electively into the study. The results showed a significant correlation between study habits and students' academic accomplishments. The top ten study habits of highly effective medical students are managing their time effectively, they get rid of interruptions (phone, family, friends) that disrupt their daily work, they use goal-setting to determine their most important activities, their daily study hours is ranging between 3 and 4 hours, they study alone for knowledge retention of medical information, learn from multiple sources and invest in technology with high efficiency, they contribute to the teaching of their peers, they study the main lecture slides with notes when no exam is coming, and they study lecture slides with notes and previous exam questions when preparing for upcoming exams; finally, they maintained motivation for self-gratification and fulfillment of their family dreams. RESULTS Six hundred and seventy-five medical students enrolled themselves electively into the study. The results showed a significant correlation between study habits and students' academic accomplishments. The top ten study habits of highly effective medical students are managing their time effectively, they get rid of interruptions (phone, family, friends) that disrupt their daily work, they use goal-setting to determine their most important activities, their daily study hours is ranging between 3 and 4 hours, they study alone for knowledge retention of medical information, learn from multiple sources and invest in technology with high efficiency, they contribute to the teaching of their peers, they study the main lecture slides with notes when no exam is coming, and they study lecture slides with notes and previous exam questions when preparing for upcoming exams; finally, they maintained motivation for self-gratification and fulfillment of their family dreams.This study's outcomes consolidate general study practices that can be credited to learning achievement and expand recognition to inspire less accomplished students by investigating and exploring factors that have enhanced and worked for many accomplished students. CONCLUSION This study's outcomes consolidate general study practices that can be credited to learning achievement and expand recognition to inspire less accomplished students by investigating and exploring factors that have enhanced and worked for many accomplished students.

Training Canadian Seminarians in Empathy

Abstract: Acknowledged as a vital skill both within and outside the counseling relationship, the influence of empathy on society is becoming well-established. Its benefits include positive impacts on the helping relationship, greater prosocial activities, positive character traits, and a decrease in negative behaviors. Its usage is also encouraged by the Catholic Church, particularly the writings of Pope Francis. While its benefits are recognized, recent observations show a marked downward trend in empathy among emerging adults (Millennials and Generation Z). Such declines are worrisome not only for the identified cohorts, but for the church and society as a whole. Despite such trends, little is done in Canada to educate English Catholic seminarians in the early stages of formation in both empathy and various pastoral issues. To address this need, an empathy seminar, educating seminarians in the early stages of formation, was proposed. The seminar used didactic and skills training which provided seminarians with a basic theoretical framework on both empathy and six pastoral challenges: culture, abortion, same-sex attraction, domestic violence, gender dysphoria, and separation and divorce. The seminar took place over a three-day period (15 hours) in September 2020, with 27participants. A range of evaluation tools, including the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), post-seminar survey, and interviews, were implemented. The evaluation tools showed a slight increase in empathy and knowledge retention among participants. The TEQ showed a mean score of 46.84in the pre-seminar survey, and a post-seminar result of 47.76, indicating above-average empathy among seminarians. A paired t-test (two-tailed p value of .1701) indicated that the difference for the overall sample was not statistically significant, which given the limited sample size is not surprising; however, it is worth noting that the sample size (25 participants) represents approximately 19% of the total English Canadian seminarian population in 2020. In the post-session interviews, seminarians found the seminar worthwhile; however, they felt changes could occur. While the seminar will not provide a complete long-term solution to empathic needs of emerging adults in the seminary, it does help to begin the conversation on how this need can be addressed in Canadian English seminaries moving forward.

Abstract: Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the global pandemic of 2020, there has been an increased focus on disaster and crisis preparedness. Emergency response personnel, health professionals, and their support staff may not be adequately prepared for a disaster or crisis relief. Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technology simulations have the potential to teach complex cognitive skills in an engaging way and at relatively low costs. The purpose of this generic qualitative inquiry was to discover how participants perceive the results of using virtual or augmented simulation methods for training of emergency response personnel. By using a modified activity analysis and development (ActAd) model derived from the activity theory, a broad spectrum of VR/AR, career fields, disciplines, and first response-type organizations were studied. The intent was to explore, compare, and contrast the differences between traditional training modalities and virtual simulation training for emergency, crisis, and disaster response professionals. A 48-question survey was designed, field-tested, and deployed to capture 10 participant views, feelings, and perspectives from their experience with virtual or augmented simulation for training and education in their workplace. The findings of this study provide guidance on perceptions that emergency, disaster, and rescue personnel have for the use of virtual training solutions. The study concludes that participants believe virtual simulation training experiences provide opportunities for increased skill acquisition and knowledge retention as compared with other training modalities. Learning motivation within a more social context was also observed with virtual simulation training. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Abstract: Learner-centered coaching and feedback are relevant to various educational contexts. Spaced retrieval enhances long-term knowledge retention. We examined the efficacy of Blank Slate, a novel spaced retrieval software application, to promote learning and prevent forgetting, while gathering and analyzing data in the background about learners' performance. A total of 93 students from 6 universities in the United States were assigned randomly to control, sequential or algorithm conditions. Participants watched a video on the Republic of Georgia before taking a 60 multiple-choice-question assessment. Sequential (non-spaced retrieval) and algorithm (spaced retrieval) groups had access to Blank Slate and 60 digital cards. The algorithm group reviewed subsets of cards daily based on previous individual performance. The sequential group reviewed all 60 cards daily. All 93 participants were re-assessed 4 weeks later. Sequential and algorithm groups were significantly different from the control group but not from each other with regard to after and delta scores. Blank Slate prevented anticipated forgetting; authentic learning improvement and retention happened instead, with spaced retrieval incurring one-third of the time investment experienced by non-spaced retrieval. Embedded analytics allowed for real-time monitoring of learning progress that could form the basis of helpful feedback to learners for self-directed learning and educators for coaching.

Abstract: Team-based learning (TBL) is an active learning method used in many educational institutions. However, there are few examples of its use in basic medicine, such as biochemistry in medical schools. This study used TBL to teach glucose metabolism to first-year medical students. The process was in four phases: preclass preparation, readiness assurance tests, advanced questions, and a TBL test, with peer evaluation and a questionnaire. There were positive correlations between the TBL test, peer evaluation, and individual readiness test performance. Tests were taken immediately after learning and 2 weeks later, and scores decreased significantly less with TBL than traditional lectures (-2.3% vs. -17.5%). This suggests that TBL was more effective than traditional lectures in supporting knowledge retention. We used a Moodle system to facilitate communication between students and teachers, and this was evaluated positively by both groups. It was particularly useful for managing TBL. These findings suggest that TBL could be used to improve student performance in biochemistry.

Abstract: In the United States, 350,000+ fatalities are due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (CPR Certification HQ, 2018). If patients do not receive quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within the first few minutes of the attack, they will perish. According to the American Heart Association (2019b), healthcare (HC) providers have reduced CPR knowledge in as little as three months from being certificated (American CPR, 2019). Based on these facts, it is imperative that HC providers retain CPR knowledge for quality care. Faculty are attempting to find the best way to teach life-saving skills to the younger generations. One strategy that is being incorporated is peer-assisted learning (PAL). The purpose of this study was to investigate how a PAL community would affect undergraduate pre-professional HC students’ skill effectiveness and knowledge retention in learning CPR, as well as their confidence and anxiety levels when performing this task; it focused only on the effects gained by the peer learner. Part One of this study evaluated a 15 question Pre-and Post-CPR Simulation survey for internal consistency and variable grouping via exploratory factor analysis. Part Two compared the effectiveness of two learning conditions examined among undergraduate pre-professional HC students. An objective effectiveness score was collected via mannequin-based testing; each learning environment’s scores were analyzed and compared using a MANOVA analysis. A Pre-and Post-CPR Simulation survey was administered to determine confidence and anxiety. Pre-CPR Simulation questions were measured using a repeated-measures ANOVA test, while Post-CPR Simulation questions were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test. The Pre-and Post-CPR Simulation survey was considered internally consistent; however, it did not have three factors emerge during the factor analysis and varimax rotation as previously published. In Part Two, there was no significant findings in mannequin variables or the pre-and post-surveys between learning environments. The sole significant result was a survey question stating that students felt more knowledgeable with performing CPR over time; this was noted in both environments. This research adds to current PAL research that focuses exclusively on the peer learner rather than the peer tutor.

Abstract: There is a need to retain highly skilled and specialized talent in today's dynamic and highly competitive global business environment. The challenge is not only selecting, recruiting, and hiring the right talent, but also making sure that talent is retained for as long as possible after the hire date. The intention of employees to stay employed is critical and a strategic business differentiator for organizational success due to the high cost of recruitment, the intrinsic loss of knowledge and expertise, and the often non-documented and not understood loss of productivity. The purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI), SOAR and retention (RET) among a sample of professionals who are actively working with a direct supervisor. A sample of 352 participants completed the 16-item Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale to estimate their leaders' EI, the 19-item SOAR profile to estimate their leaders' SOAR-based capacity, and the Intention to Remain scale to self-report their RET. This study was designed as a quantitative cross-sectional survey design to investigate three research questions and test three study hypotheses regarding the EI and SOAR-based capacity of leaders, and the effects leader EI and leader SOAR have on subordinate RET. Participants were either active members of an Alumni Association of a Midwestern University, or current working and former professional contacts of the researcher. Survey data were analyzed using general linear model (GLM) statistical analysis. Results found statistical support for leader EI and leader SOAR as positive predictors of subordinate RET. Results also found SOAR moderated the relationship between EI and RET in males but not females. The implications of this study would suggest that employers and higher education instructors must embrace the challenge of identifying the right talent with the relevant EI abilities and SOAR capabilities (soft skills) required for today's business needs such as: critical thinking, collaboration, active listening, interpersonal skills, strategic thinking, and communication. In addition to collaborating with higher education on the development and the teaching of EI and SOAR soft skills, organizational leaders should create a culture that encourages all employees to have inclusive and meaningful conversations. This can be accomplished utilizing the SOAR capabilities of active listening, engagement, communication, and the creation of meaningful dialogue.

Abstract: Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) was created by the American Academy of Pediatrics to provide education for pediatric post-graduate trainees in the initial management of newborns that require transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Studies have shown that clinical performance and theoretical knowledge retention begins to significantly decline soon after this course is completed, in as little as six months. It has been suggested that providing NRP courses as often as every six months may improve retention of NRP knowledge and skill. We conducted a survey study of resident trainees to assess the impact of a booster educational class at six months following the initial class. Due to low survey response rate our data is limited; however, we found a clear trend i n increased resident comfort levels following a booster class. The specific scenarios included in the training were: 39-week vaginal delivery with meconium stained amniotic fluid, 28-week premature cesarean delivery for maternal pre-eclampsia, neonatal intubation, and umbilical venous and arterial catheterization. We suggest that an NRP booster class adds value to resident comfort in performing neonatal resuscitations and procedures and that its effectiveness should be studied on a larger sample.

Abstract: Conference Title: 2021 IEEE 24th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD) Conference Start Date: 2021, May 5 Conference End Date: 2021, May 7 Conference Location: Dalian, China Educational games can facilitate teaching and learning. However, research on feedback types in educational games requires further investigation. Feedback in educational games could enhance students' learning, but it is not the more complex the feedback, the better. This study investigated the effects of different types of feedback in games on students' learning. The results indicated that when learning goals point to knowledge retention, receiving knowledge of correct response (KCR) or receiving elaborated feedback (EF) was better than receiving knowledge of results (KR). When learning goals point to knowledge transfer, receiving EF was better than receiving KCR or receiving KR, and receiving KCR was better than receiving KR. The results of this study integrate knowledge retention, knowledge transfer and learner cognitive load to inform the selection of educational game feedback types.

Abstract: Purpose The vulnerability of multinational corporation (MNC) knowledge network is one of the major causes for the failure and even the death of MNCs in the fierce global market competition. Employee turnover and knowledge loss are the triggers for the MNC knowledge network vulnerability and a matter of serious concern in the evolution and development of MNC knowledge network. The purpose of this work is to propose a valid and quantitative measurement method to investigate the influence of employee loss and knowledge loss on the vulnerability of MNC knowledge network. Design/methodology/approach MNC knowledge network is inherently a heterogeneous network where there are mainly two types of units: employees and their knowledge. Therefore, this paper establishes a weighted super-network model for MNC knowledge network to depict its heterogeneous composition. On the basis of the weighted MNC knowledge super-network, the static and dynamic vulnerability measurement methods are further proposed to investigate and evaluate MNC knowledge network vulnerability. Findings A real case is given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed weighted MNC knowledge super-network model and the network vulnerability measurement methods. The results show the super-network model proposed in this paper can effectively embody the complex features of MNC knowledge network, and the vulnerability measurement methods can effectively investigate the influence of employee loss and knowledge loss on network vulnerability. Originality/value From the perspective of super-network, researchers and practitioners can get a more systematic and deeper understanding of the MNC knowledge network and its human and knowledge resource constitute which are vital for the evolution and development of MNC. Moreover, the MNC knowledge network vulnerability measurement methods can effectively measure and analyze the influence of resource loss on network vulnerability, which can provide a helpful decision support for monitoring and managing of MNC knowledge network vulnerability to reduce its adverse effects.

Abstract: The gap between the number of available STEM workers and employers’ needs in the workforce is projected to be about two million by 2025. One way to reduce the magnitude of this gap is to increase the number of entry-level STEM workers joining the workforce, however the attrition rate for college STEM majors is about 33%. Research has indicated that students’ study strategies and affective factors are related to student retention. This qualitative case study explored the study strategies of students using adaptive learning technology in a gateway STEM class, General Chemistry. The researcher sought to understand how the students describe their transfer of learning outside of the course adaptive learning environment to course assessments and laboratory work in their own voices, using semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion. Understanding the study strategies used by students, whose expectations of knowledge transfer are in alignment with their assessments and laboratory work, may lead to identifying interventions that may assist other students in more successfully transferring their knowledge and aid in their retention in STEM fields of study. The overarching research question was, “What study strategies do General Chemistry students describe using in the adaptive learning environment that impact successful knowledge transfer to assessments and laboratory work in the General Chemistry class?” The conceptual framework informing this study was built on sociocultural and self-determination theories, and three streams of literature: the shortage in the STEM workforce, factors affecting STEM students’ knowledge retention, and adaptive learning environments in higher education were reviewed. The findings in this study led to four results among the participants using the adaptive learning environment for homework assignments in General Chemistry: personalized learning strategies were utilized by the participants in General Chemistry at the College to learn new content, personalized study strategies were employed by the participants in General Chemistry at the College in preparation for assessments, responsibility for the development of the participants’ study strategies was placed on themselves, and the sentiment of the adaptive learning environment in transfer of learning was generally positive. The recommendations emanating from this study include sharing the results of this study with professors and administrators at the College using or considering adaptive learning environments, encouraging professors to conduct study strategy sessions with their classes early in each semester, encouraging the faculty to use data analytics from adaptive learning environments to determine if specific students need study strategy coaching, and conducting this study with a screening criterion which includes learners who are not self-directed in the development of their study strategies, so that the data may be compared to the findings of this study.

Abstract: The importance of self-regulated learning (SRL) during studying has been heavily researched. Yet, self-report and lab-based designs limit our understanding of how students regulate their learning during authentic study tasks. Recently, calls have been made to further examine how students self-regulate during studying through the use of trace data on real learning content. Additionally, research on study tactics and strategies suggests learners can benefit from utilizing certain tactics over others, with relations to improved knowledge retention and positive academic outcomes. In this dissertation, we first conduct a comprehensive literature review that identifies and defines common terminology within the study domain. Through the defining of terms, a taxonomy is proposed that assists in synthesizing prior research. Additionally, two key frameworks (SRL and approaches to learning) commonly used to investigate studying are discussed. Suggestions for advancing the field include: adhering to defined study terms; matching measurement types to study terms; and utilizing trace-based data to capture self-regulated learning in authentic learning environments. Based on our literature review, two manuscripts are presented that aim to address these gaps. The first manuscript builds on prior research in SRL and proposes the design of a mobile application with the goal of supporting SRL in authentic learning environments. The second manuscript empirically tests the impact of the mobile app on students' self-regulation, study tactic and strategy use using self-report, log-files, and open response data. Results suggest the mobile app is effective at encouraging self-regulation of study behaviors and increases study tactic use. The findings have implications for using a mobile platform to investigate and support informal learning in higher education. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

Impacts of Maternal Obesity on Placental Development and Mid-Gestation Lipid Storage; Effects of Quiz Administration on Knowledge Retention and Study Habits in Veterinary Medicine Students

Abstract: Obesity is associated with reduced female fertility which can be due to abnormal placenta function. Thermoneutral housing (30 °C vs. 22 °C) of mice induces an obese phenotype without dietary changes. At mid-gestation thermoneutral mice had decreased pregnancy rates compared to control. There were no differences in embryo development rate or size, but thermoneutral mice had decreased trophectoderm outgrowth, which will become the placenta, and decreased circulating estrogen, which is important for uterine receptivity. We also examined mid-gestation placental lipid composition and metabolism in mice fed high fat/high sugar diet to induce obesity. Obese mice had increased placental lipid droplet number compared to lean. Further, the abundance of lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine species were altered. There were no differences in lipid metabolism, however there was increased expression of apolipoproteins which are important for lipid handling. Together, these data suggest that the cumulative effect of poor implantation and placentation as well as increased lipid storage may contribute to fetal loss due to obesity. In the classroom, a variety of methods are used to help students learn and retain information. However, some methods can be difficult to implement or may be burdensome for students. We utilized weekly quizzes as a method to improve knowledge retention and regulate study time in veterinary medicine students. In units where quizzes were given, we saw little difference in academic performance compared to when quizzes were not given; however, quizzes were associated with greater knowledge retention in year 2 of the study. Study time was strongly correlated with number of exams per week, but no relationship existed with quiz number. Students studied more during non-exam weeks when quizzes were given but study time was reduced during weeks with exams, suggesting that quizzes helped reduce cramming before exams. Regardless of a weekly increase in study time, students found quizzes beneficial and would prefer use of quizzes in future classes.

Abstract: Currently, there are four generations working in organizations globally. Many companies are facing corporate tacit knowledge loss as senior managers and executives retire. The problem is that some organizational leaders do not have an integrated information technology plan in creating, documenting, managing, sharing, and preserving organizational knowledge, particularly tacit knowledge. The lack of information technology strategy to manage the creation, storing, transfer, and retention of tacit knowledge is exacerbated as talented young workers are leaving organizations in searchfor better career opportunities. The purpose of this qualitative classical Delphi was to get a consensus from a panel of executive and senior manager experts on a strategy and plan to create, store, share, and keep tacit knowledge in an IT organization. The study was limited to one IT company. A panel of nine experts with senior management experiencein IT project teams reached a consensus after three rounds. The major themes focused on mentoring, communication, environment, and leadership. The experts suggested a mentorship strategy and growth mindset incentive as a future framework to close the tacit knowledge gap. Leaders and practitioners were recommended to offer reverse mentoringand cross generational mentoring programs to effectively share and keep tacit knowledge in organizations. Future research suggested exploring personality traits of those willing to share tacit knowledge. Moreover, exploring tacit knowledge sharing strategies in other industry companies and government agencies. The study findings reinforced the need for multigenerational organizations to find a strategy and incentive plan to close the tacit knowledge gap.

Abstract: Risk management business leaders face eminent knowledge loss from retiring senior leaders if written succession strategies are not in place. Grounded in the organizational knowledge creation theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the succession strategies used by risk management leaders to retain tacit knowledge from retiring senior leaders. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with five risk management leaders in Florida, organizational succession plans, and reports from organizational knowledge transfer programs. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged: organizational knowledge transfer, knowledge management-succession planning, knowledge retention, and generational knowledge transfer. A key recommendation is for risk management business leaders to develop written succession plans using mentoring and knowledge transfer tools while considering the succeeding junior leaders' expectations. The implications for positive social change include the potential for organizational sustainability of risk management operations, increasing local economies through leadership development, and job sustainability.

Abstract: The success of flipped classrooms is dependent upon students' preparation prior to class, the lack of which is the most common challenge associated with this teaching methodology. To mitigate this limitation, it is important to develop and assess methods of engaging learners during pre-class activities. BACKGROUND The success of flipped classrooms is dependent upon students' preparation prior to class, the lack of which is the most common challenge associated with this teaching methodology. To mitigate this limitation, it is important to develop and assess methods of engaging learners during pre-class activities.To determine if quiz delivery method (embedded throughout versus after pre-class videos) affects students' knowledge retention, grades, and video viewing behavior. OBJECTIVE To determine if quiz delivery method (embedded throughout versus after pre-class videos) affects students' knowledge retention, grades, and video viewing behavior.Participating students were randomized to take quizzes, either during pre-class videos via Panopto ™ (EQV) or after pre-class videos in the traditional manner via Moodle ™ (TMM). Outcomes assessed included students' knowledge retention, scores on pre- and post-class quizzes, and pre-class video viewing behavior (total views and minutes viewed per student) during a three-week period. Having experienced both quizzing modalities during the semester, the perceptions from students in the EQV group were surveyed. METHODS Participating students were randomized to take quizzes, either during pre-class videos via Panopto™ (EQV) or after pre-class videos in the traditional manner via Moodle™ (TMM). Outcomes assessed included students' knowledge retention, scores on pre- and post-class quizzes, and pre-class video viewing behavior (total views and minutes viewed per student) during a three-week period. Having experienced both quizzing modalities during the semester, the perceptions from students in the EQV group were surveyed.Baseline assessment results of both groups (n = 27 per group) were comparable with a median score of 33% (IQR: 17, 50) in both groups. Performance was also similar on knowledge retention [TMM: 67% (50, 83) vs. EQV: 83% (50, 83)], pre-class quiz scores [TMM: 90% (87, 97) vs. EQV: 93% (90, 95)], and post-class quiz scores [TMM: 93% (80, 100) vs. EQV: 87% (80, 100)], while students in the EQV group had more total views [10 (8, 12)] vs. [5 (2, 11)] and minutes viewed [71 (36, 108) vs. 35 (15, 81)]. Results from the perception survey administered to students in the EQV group (74.1% response rate) indicated a preference for embedded quizzes overall (58%) and for class preparation (75%) when compared with post-video quizzes. RESULTS Baseline assessment results of both groups (n = 27 per group) were comparable with a median score of 33% (IQR: 17, 50) in both groups.

Using embedded quizzes for formative rather than summative assessment might be an appropriate mechanism to encourage students' viewing of pre-class videos and their preparation for flipped classes. CONCLUSION Students' knowledge retention and performance were similar in both EQV and TMM groups, though students in the EQV group were more engaged with videos and most of them preferred this quiz delivery. Using embedded quizzes for formative rather than summative assessment might be an appropriate mechanism to encourage students' viewing of pre-class videos and their preparation for flipped classes.

Abstract: This phenomenological study aimed to explore a group of classroom teachers' experiences with homework assignment in teaching mathematics. The participants of the study were 27 classroom teachers who were selected using the criterion-based sampling technique. The research data were collected with a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers and subjected to interpretive phenomenological analysis. The results showed that the teachers plan the homework they would assign the evening before the class and use resources available on the internet while planning it. It was also revealed that they assign mathematics homework for various purposes such as ensuring comprehension of the subjects, knowledge retention and use of the learned subjects in daily life. They reported that they check and provide feedback on the assigned homework during the classes that the assigned homework is sometimes done by the family members of the students and that both preparing and checking the homework take an extensive amount of time. As a solution to these problems, they suggested communicating and negotiating with the parents, getting support from school counselors and reducing the number of the themes in the primary mathematics curriculum.

Abstract: The aim of study is to compare the contributions of virtual and real museum tours in terms of perceived presence and knowledge retention. The sample of study which was 28 third graders enrolled in a public primary school in an informal instructional process. There were two groups (virtual group and real group); one visited virtual museum (n=14), and the other (n=14) visited real one. Semi-structured interview form and student drawings were used to discuss students' evaluations about two environments. The results suggested that students who have attended virtual museum tour remember much more about the events and objects than students who have visited real museum tour. Students who attended virtual museum tours had perceived presence mostly as much as and in some cases, more than the real group students. Implementations for designing virtual and real museums for feeling more presence and contributing to knowledge retention are also included.

Abstract: This 2-group quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the following research questions: Do the fourth graders' post-intervention scores achieved in the unit of force and motion achievement test and attitude scale toward the unit depend on being in the groups that were taught the unit either with 'Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material' (ONACOM) integrated PBL and with ONACOM-integrated EL when we control for their respective pretest scores and their science grades in the previous semester? What are the students' gains, achievement, attitude and retention from the two systematic applications of the ONACOM-integrated methods, PBL and EL? The sample (N=220) consisted of fourth graders at public elementary schools in Burdur, Turkey. Although there were no significant treatment effects favoring one of the methods, teaching science topics by integrating ONACOM consistently in both methods increased the students' achievement and attitude levels and supported their knowledge retention with large effect sizes significantly. As well-developed innovative software, ONACOM is effective on learning regardless of the course and method when it is systematically integrated into teaching methods, since it is prepared on the basis of multimedia learning strategies and is suitable for the essential structures of both teaching methods.

Abstract: Sustainability challenges are complex and call for the effective development of knowledge, skills, and abilities in current and new leaders. New offerings in higher education provide sustainability training to complement studies in geography, engineering, science, and other disciplines, in many cases including innovative experiential learning components -- including the use of reflection. Although reflection in education is not a new concept, how to assess reflection has remained challenging. Recent research on the Reflective Learning Framework (RLF) aims to address many of the challenges associated with guiding, assessing, and evaluating student learning through reflections. The objective of this research was to investigate the perceptions of students who use the RLF about their experience using reflection in a sustainability course. Semi-structured interviews with students provide a valuable perspective on the use of reflection. Particularly, findings from this research indicate that students see reflection as a tool to develop and use cognitive and metacognitive skills, and also as a tool to support knowledge retention and transfer. Accordingly, student perspectives on reflection show that this practice contributes to the acquisition of higher-order thinking skills required to address the complex challenges of sustainability.

Abstract: Online homework systems have been shown to help student achievement in chemistry courses. This study sought to compare the levels of knowledge retention in students over the course of a semester, using two different types of homework systems--the adaptive-responsive system and the traditional-responsive system. Two sections of a first semester general chemistry course were investigated, with one section using the adaptive-responsive system and the other using the traditional-responsive system. Students' grades on cumulative exams were compared across both sections, and it was found that students using the adaptive-responsive system scored significantly higher on the exams and retained significantly more information than the students in the other section. The results of this study should help inform the choices educators make regarding the homework system they choose to use, or even which parts of the different systems they choose to use or not to use based on the outcomes they would like for their student population.

How organizations leverage collaborative technology for knowledge management: A systematic review

Author: Shah-Nelson, Clark11 University of Maryland University College, School of Business, US

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/how-organizations-leverage-collaborative/docview/2526264637/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Organizations can lose knowledge as fast as they can create it. Retiring Baby Boomers, job-hopping Millennials and out-of-date communication and collaboration practices contribute to organizational knowledge loss. This knowledge loss costs organizations billions of dollars for re- learning and for hiring, onboarding and training new employees. Knowledge management strategies foster knowledge retention and are critical to facilitating innovation. Knowledge management can be enhanced using collaborative technologies such as enterprise wikis, instant messaging, collaborative writing, project management, blockchain and semantic web technologies powered by artificial intelligence. Through a systematic review and synthesis of 46 critically appraised studies that span global contexts and sectors, this dissertation informs scholars and practitioners by providing evidence and recommendations to global organizations looking to implement, adopt or utilize collaborative technologies to retain knowledge, prevent knowledge loss or establish and strengthen an organizational culture that fosters knowledge management. Through thematic synthesis and qualitative analysis of inductive codes across scholarly articles, this research highlights aspects of affordances (access to knowledge, knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries, searchability) and organizational culture (knowledge sharing culture, transparency, the role of management) as keys to strategically leverage collaborative technologies for knowledge management. Organizations can retain their knowledge and build innovative capacity by systematically adopting and implementing collaborative technologies. By fostering transparency and knowledge sharing across boundaries, encouraging managers and leaders to promote a collaborative and transparent culture, and prioritizing the continued use of these technologies, organizations can maximize their knowledge management outcomes.

Therefore, the proposed combined model of horizontal blended learning with flipped classroom was designed to help the lecturers to organize the online teaching for their students. The idea is to focus on two event activities, one is the self-learning through the LMS and another is the wrapped-up lecture by the facilitator. The 30% of activities are the face-to-face class organized for the formative assessment with the students. Additionally, the class is conducted in both synchronous and asynchronous modes. The case study is conducted with the Information Technology students who enrolled in the Introduction to Cloud Computing course. As the results, the proposed teaching model can enhance the students’ knowledge retention more than those of the traditional classroom with the t-Test analysis show its significance of Pvalue at $0.014 \lt 0.05$. The attitude tests of the students can confirm that the proposed model is suitable for a disruptive situation like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract: Background: Serious games are potential alternatives for supplementing traditional simulation-based education for neonatal resuscitation training. However, evidence regarding the benefits of using serious games to improve long-term knowledge retention of neonatal resuscitation in undergraduate medical students is lacking. Objective: We designed a serious computer game "NEOGAMES" to train undergraduate medical students in neonatal resuscitation in a cost-friendly and accessible way and to examine whether serious game-based training improves long-term knowledge retention in medical students. Methods: "NEOGAMES" consists of a screen with images of an incubator, a baby, visual objects, anatomy, action cards, monitors, real-time feedback, and emotional components. Undergraduate medical students from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University were invited to participate and were allocated to a game group or a control group. Participants in the game group played the game before the training. All the participants completed three written tests, pre- and post-training knowledge tests and a follow-up test after 6 months. Results: Eighty-one medical students participated in the study. The student demographic characteristics of the groups were comparable, including sex, age, and grade point average (GPA). Significant short-term knowledge improvement was noticed only for male students in the game group based on their 5.2-point higher test scores than those of the controls ( p = 0.006). However, long-term knowledge improvement at 6 months was identified for both male and female students in the game group, with test scores 21.8 and 20 points higher, respectively, than those of the controls ( P < 0.001). The long-term knowledge retention in the game group was almost 3 times higher than that in the control group. Conclusions: Long-term knowledge retention was nearly 3 times higher for the game group than for the control group. The improvement in knowledge supports the use of serious games for undergraduate medical education.Background: Serious games are potential alternatives for supplementing traditional simulation-based education for neonatal resuscitation training. However, evidence regarding the benefits of using serious games to improve long-term knowledge retention of neonatal resuscitation in undergraduate medical students is lacking. Objective: We designed a serious computer game "NEOGAMES" to train undergraduate medical students in neonatal resuscitation in a cost-friendly and accessible way and to examine whether serious game-based training improves long-term knowledge retention in medical students. Methods: "NEOGAMES" consists of a screen with images of an incubator, a baby, visual objects, anatomy, action cards, monitors, real-time feedback, and emotional components. Undergraduate medical students from Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University were invited to participate and were allocated to a game group or a control group. Participants in the game group played the game before the training. All the participants completed three written tests, pre- and post-training knowledge tests and a follow-up test after 6 months. Results: Eighty-one medical students participated in the study. The student demographic characteristics of the groups were comparable, including sex, age, and grade point average (GPA). Significant short-term knowledge improvement was noticed only for male students in the game group based on their 5.2-point higher test scores than those of the controls (p = 0.006). However, long-term knowledge improvement at 6 months was identified for both male and female students in the game group, with test scores 21.8 and 20 points higher, respectively, than those of the controls (P < 0.001). The long-term knowledge retention in the game group was almost 3 times higher than that in the control group. Conclusions: Long-term knowledge retention was nearly 3 times higher for the game group than for the control group. The improvement in knowledge supports the use of serious games for undergraduate medical education.

Abstract: O objetivo desta revisão de literatura é debater sobre a relevância em abordar a transferência de conhecimentos de trabalhadores em fase de aposentadoria como uma possível prática empreendedora, a qual pode resultar em satisfação pessoal e desenvolvimento organizacional. O cenário brasileiro atual aponta para o crescente envelhecimento populacional e destaca que a perda de conhecimentos decorrente do processo de aposentadoria pode representar uma ameaça para os grupos de trabalho e para as organizações. Apesar de os estudos internacionais avançarem crescentemente no que diz respeito à relação entre empreendedorismo e conhecimento, o debate nacional ainda é incipiente, especialmente na área das Ciências Sociais Aplicadas. Assim, torna-se pertinente incentivar estudos que abordem a transferência de conhecimentos de trabalhadores em fase de aposentadoria como uma prática intraempreendedora, uma vez que esta possibilita a constante criação de conhecimento e inovação nas organizações, além de minimizar a perda da memória organizacional. Alternate abstract: The purpose of this literature review is to discuss the relevance of approaching the knowledge transfer of workers in the retirement phase as a possible entrepreneurial practice, which can result in personal satisfaction and organizational development. The current Brazilian scenario points to the growing aging of the population and stresses that the loss of knowledge resulting from the retirement process can pose a threat to working groups and organizations. Although international studies are increasingly advancing with regard to the relationship between entrepreneurship and knowledge, the national debate is still incipient, especially in the area of Applied Social Sciences. Thus, it is pertinent to encourage studies that address the knowledge transfer of workers in the retirement phase as an intrapreneurial practice, since this enables the constant creation of knowledge and innovation in organizations, in addition to minimizing the loss of organizational memory.

Abstract: The primary purpose of this study was to determine if WebVR enhances the knowledge retention regarding mechanical components of high-risk moving machinery, specifically elevators. There were 23 participants divided into a treatment group and comparison group. The treatment group used WebVR to take a virtual elevator machine room tour while the comparison group studied printed images of the same elevator machine room. These alternative activities were conducted prior to a field trip to a real elevator machine room. Gains in knowledge pre to post were measured and compared between the treatment and comparison groups.The research findings showed an overall gain in knowledge for the participants in the elevator bootcamp. More in depth analysis showed the treatment group exhibited significant gains for six of the ten knowledge areas while the comparison group exhibited significant gains in three of the ten targeted knowledge areas. The treatment group gained more knowledge on components higher than eye-level while the comparison group scored better on components that were below eye-level or on the floor. Both groups were seen actively engaged in the field trips. The treatment group members exposed to the virtual reality elevator machine room frequently referred to what they saw in the WebVR while the comparison group did not refer to their printed images while on an actual tour of the elevator machine room.Virtual reality training of this type has the potential to improve basic knowledge and safety trainings. Added, it provides trainings to large numbers of people across the globe who would otherwise not receive such training. This type of training has the potential to save the lives of workers in high risk electro-mechanical spaces and similar settings in different industries.

Abstract: Background Video-based teaching has been part of medical education for some time but 360° videos using a virtual reality (VR) device are a new medium that offer extended possibilities. We investigated whether adding a 360° VR video to the internship curriculum leads to an improvement of long-term recall of specific knowledge on a gentle Caesarean Sections (gCS) and on general obstetric knowledge. Methods Two weeks prior to their Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) internship, medical students were divided in teaching groups, that did or did not have access to a VR-video of a gCS. Six weeks after their O&G internship, potentially having observed one or multiple real-life CSs, knowledge on the gCS was assessed with an open questionnaire, and knowledge on general obstetrics with a multiple-choice questionnaire. Furthermore we assessed experienced anxiety during in-person attendance of CSs, and we asked whether the interns would have wanted to attend more CSs in-person. The 360° VR video group was questioned about their experience directly after they watched the video. We used linear regression analyses to determine significant effects on outcomes. Results A total of 89 medical students participated, 41 in the 360° VR video group and 48 in the conventional study group. Watching the 360° VR video did not result in a difference in either specific or general knowledge retention between the intervention group and the conventional study group. This was both true for the grade received for the internship, the open-ended questions as well as the multiple-choice questions and this did not change after adjustment for confounding factors. Still, 83.4% of the 360° VR video-group reported that more videos should be used in training to prepare for surgical procedures. In the 360° VR video-group 56.7% reported side effects like nausea or dizziness. After adjustment for the number of attended CSs during the practical internship, students in the 360° VR video-group stated less often ( p  = 0.04) that they would have liked to attend more CSs in-person as compared to the conventional study group. Conclusion Even though the use of 360° VR video did not increase knowledge, it did offer a potential alternative for attending a CS in-person and a new way to prepare the students for their first operating room experiences.

Abstract: Knowledge is a valuable asset, and managing that knowledge is now recognized as a significant contributor to organizations in the current business climate. The problem is that the loss of knowledge impacts project quality, organizational efficiency, and customer satisfaction. Too often, managers do not adequately communicate the knowledge retention strategies needed to reduce the impact of knowledge loss on project productivity. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore knowledge retention strategies to prevent knowledge loss in project-based organizations. The knowledge-based view of the firm and intellectual capital formed the conceptual framework. Eight participants consisting of managers, full-time employees, and consultants participated in the study. Data collection included semi-structured interviews using Zoom video teleconferencing software. Data analysis involved using two cycles of descriptive, pattern and focused coding to develop emerging codes and themes. This study revealed three themes: knowledge retention benefits, knowledge retention challenges, and knowledge retention strategies. This study’s findings may help management develop and implement a knowledge retention strategy to identify, capture, and retain critical knowledge in their organization. The implication for positive social change may include organizations creating a positive workplace that influences employees to share and retain knowledge, increasing an organization’s knowledge repository.

Abstract: Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma and the second-leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Although timely diagnosis and proper adherence to therapeutic regimen prevent blindness, patient nonadherence continues to be the greatest challenge to effective treatment. Preliminary research suggested that culturally interactive education delivery may increase patient adherence. However, this education intervention had not occurred with glaucoma treatment. The transtheoretical model of behavior change served as the framework for this study. The research questions addressed the effect that glaucoma education provided by a culturally competent patient navigator had on patient knowledge of glaucoma, adherence to medication use, and follow-up appointment attendance. This quantitative study had a longitudinal design with archival data from 206 Russian Eastern European immigrant patients. The control group had a standard appointment with an ophthalmologist, and the experimental group had an interactive educational experience with a patient navigator after the standard appointment. The navigator administered the Glaucoma Knowledge Index at three time points: before the appointment (T1), after the appointment (T2), and at a 1-month follow-up (T3). The intervention group showed a statistically significant increase in glaucoma knowledge retention at T2 and T3. However, this increase in knowledge did not correspond to a statistically significant difference in patients’ adherence to follow-up eye exam attendance or ocular medication adherence. The outcome of this study may form the basis for discussions among policymakers leading to positive social change.

Abstract: Globalization has increased the turnover of skilled employees who resign without transferring their tacit knowledge, which makes up 85% of organizational knowledge. Insurance agency owner-managers who fail to transfer knowledge from employees who resign negatively impact their firm financially due to repetitive efforts, the loss of time and resources, and organizational failure. Grounded in complexity leadership theory, the purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to explore the strategies insurance agency owner-managers use to retain tacit knowledge from employees who resign. The participants comprised six insurance agency owner-managers in Southern Connecticut who successfully used strategies to retain tacit knowledge from employees who resigned. Data were collected from semistructured interviews and examining the organizations’ policies and internal records relating to knowledge retention strategies. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Three themes emerged: knowledge-sharing strategies, employee development strategies, and customer-centric strategies. A key recommendation is for insurance agency owner-managers to identify and mitigate tacit knowledge-sharing barriers and incorporate knowledge-sharing practices into their business models, which requires effective communication, consistency, and inclusion into knowledge-sharing processes. The implications for social change include the potential for insurance agency owner-managers to increase shared values and long-term prosperity of clients and consumers, make financial contributions to communities, and create new employment opportunities.

Gamification in nursing literature: an integrative review

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/gamification-nursing-literature-integrative/docview/2501518492/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Objective Gamification is an increasingly popular instructional strategy in nursing. The purpose of this integrative review is to explore gamification as it has been applied in nursing literature. This integrative review seeks to ask the question – What aspects of gamification have been explored in nursing literature and what aspects require further exploration? Method Whittemore, R., & Knafl, K. (2005). The integrative review: Updated methodology. Methodological Issues in Nursing Research , 52(5), 546–553 integrative review framework guided this review. Seventeen articles were reviewed and a quality appraisal tool (developed by Hawker, S., Payne, S., Kerr, C., Hardey, M., & Powell, J. (2002). Appraising the evidence: Reviewing disparate data systematically. Qualitative Health Research , 12(9), 1284–1299) was also used to evaluate the articles. Results Following the data analysis stage outlined in Whittemore and Knafl’s integrative review framework, six themes emerged: construct conceptualization; relationship between engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge retention; knowledge translation, motivation, role of technology, and gamification elements. Conclusion Gamification is of interest to the nursing profession. More study is needed to better ascertain the relationship between gamification and several of the main themes identified in this review.

Abstract: An important question for oral health education is whether knowledge gained during lay-led workshops is retained and applied in daily practice. This study assessed the knowledge retention and changes in oral health practices several months after oral health education workshops were held for migrant farmworkers by Community Health Workers (CHWs). INTRODUCTION An important question for oral health education is whether knowledge gained during lay-led workshops is retained and applied in daily practice. This study assessed the knowledge retention and changes in oral health practices several months after oral health education workshops were held for migrant farmworkers by Community Health Workers (CHWs).Follow-up surveys were conducted with 32 participants 1 to 43 months post participation (60% between 6 and 21 months). The results showed a high degree of retention, in such areas as general oral health knowledge, and brushing/flossing frequency and technique among this sample. There was no relationship between length of time since the educational workshop and knowledge retained or behaviors changed. METHODS AND RESULTS Follow-up surveys were conducted with 32 participants 1 to 43 months post participation (60% between 6 and 21 months). The results showed a high degree of retention, in such areas as general oral health knowledge, and brushing/flossing frequency and technique among this sample. There was no relationship between length of time since the educational workshop and knowledge retained or behaviors changed.An interactive, lay-led oral health education program run by CHWs can be an effective way to deliver sustained improvements in oral health knowledge and changes in oral health practice in migrant populations. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS An interactive, lay-led oral health education program run by CHWs can be an effective way to deliver sustained improvements in oral health knowledge and changes in oral health practice in migrant populations.

The Effect of Environmental Values on German Primary School Students’ Knowledge on Water Supply

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/effect-environmental-values-on-german-primary/docview/2499318090/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Permanent access to safe drinking water is guaranteed in most industrialized countries, while climate change is turning it into a serious global issue. Knowing how to use the valuable resource water consciously and sustainably requires well-informed and ecologically aware citizens. Environmental education approaches should help develop long-term environmental knowledge, pro-environmental attitudes, and behavior with the overall goal of promoting environmental citizenship. The present study, thus, examines the influence of environmental values on students’ environmental knowledge in a German primary school sample (9–10-year-old students) by providing an authentic, out-of-school learning experience on the topic of fresh water supply. Our approach goes beyond mere correlation analyses by using structural equation modeling (SEM) to measure effects between the two variables. Environmental values were monitored using the Two Major Environmental Values Model (2-MEV) with its two dimensions, Preservation and Utilization of nature. Following a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learners’ knowledge before (T0), directly after (T1), and six weeks after (T2) module participation. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the two-factor-structure of the 2-MEV. Preservation turned out as a direct positive predictor of pre-knowledge (T0) but did not show any significant effect on post-knowledge (T1) and knowledge retention (T2). Utilization displayed a larger albeit negative direct effect on knowledge across all testing times, especially for pre- and post-knowledge. Our findings shed light on the significant impact of anthropocentric attitudes on knowledge acquisition within primary school samples and provided valuable insights into feasible environmental learning approaches.

Abstract: Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the global pandemic of 2020, there has been an increased focus on disaster and crisis preparedness. Emergency response personnel, health professionals, and their support staff may not be adequately prepared for a disaster or crisis relief. Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technology simulations have the potential to teach complex cognitive skills in an engaging way and at relatively low costs. The purpose of this generic qualitative inquiry was to discover how participants perceive the results of using virtual or augmented simulation methods for training of emergency response personnel. By using a modified activity analysis and development (ActAd) model derived from the activity theory, a broad spectrum of VR/AR, career fields, disciplines, and first response-type organizations were studied. The intent was to explore, compare, and contrast the differences between traditional training modalities and virtual simulation training for emergency, crisis, and disaster response professionals. A 48-question survey was designed, field-tested, and deployed to capture 10 participant views, feelings, and perspectives from their experience with virtual or augmented simulation for training and education in their workplace. The findings of this study provide guidance on perceptions that emergency, disaster, and rescue personnel have for the use of virtual training solutions. The study concludes that participants believe virtual simulation training experiences provide opportunities for increased skill acquisition and knowledge retention as compared with other training modalities. Learning motivation within a more social context was also observed with virtual simulation training.

Abstract: Learner-centered coaching and feedback are relevant to various educational contexts. Spaced retrieval enhances long-term knowledge retention. We examined the efficacy of Blank Slate, a novel spaced retrieval software application, to promote learning and prevent forgetting, while gathering and analyzing data in the background about learners’ performance. A total of 93 students from 6 universities in the United States were assigned randomly to control, sequential or algorithm conditions. Participants watched a video on the Republic of Georgia before taking a 60 multiple-choice-question assessment. Sequential (non-spaced retrieval) and algorithm (spaced retrieval) groups had access to Blank Slate and 60 digital cards. The algorithm group reviewed subsets of cards daily based on previous individual performance. The sequential group reviewed all 60 cards daily. All 93 participants were re-assessed 4 weeks later. Sequential and algorithm groups were significantly different from the control group but not from each other with regard to after and delta scores. Blank Slate prevented anticipated forgetting; authentic learning improvement and retention happened instead, with spaced retrieval incurring one-third of the time investment experienced by non-spaced retrieval. Embedded analytics allowed for real-time monitoring of learning progress that could form the basis of helpful feedback to learners for self-directed learning and educators for coaching.

Abstract: Game-based pedagogy has the potential to improve retention of knowledge and motivation of non-STEM students in introductory STEM courses. This study presents a new model, guided simulation, in which students complete short, focused learning activities called microtasks prior to experiencing a simulation game which provides an authentic context for those concepts. Introductory astronomy students at a designated Hispanic-serving community college in central Arizona were assigned to either a comparison group taught using traditional lecture plus group work or an intervention group taught using guided simulation. Both groups utilized the microtask curriculum developed for this study, which examined the effects of the simulation curriculum upon retention of knowledge in eight areas of astronomy concepts and upon five components of motivation for science. The results from each condition revealed that while the simulation game had no positive or negative effect upon retention of content knowledge when compared to using lecture plus group work, it did have a significantly greater effect upon the motivation of students for science. The study reveals that theoretical work into game-based pedagogy should examine the five components of motivation individually rather than as a whole in order to understand the effects of game-based pedagogy on motivation. Both groups experienced a significant increase in intrinsic motivation, however only the intervention group experienced an increase in their self-determination in science and their career motivation for science. Guided simulation can not only promote success in introductory science courses, it uniquely has the capability of encouraging non-STEM students – even first-generation and/or minority students – to consider a career in a STEM field that they would not have considered previously.

Abstract: Context Bite-sized learning is an instructional method that utilizes brief, focused learning units. This approach may be beneficial in medical education given demands on learner time and cognitive load. This study aims to assess the impact of this approach on knowledge acquisition and learner attitudes in postgraduate medical education. Methods An instructional method, termed Bite-Sized Teaching (BST), was implemented within the curriculum at a US Internal Medicine postgraduate training program. In BST, content is distilled into manageable units focused on relevant schemas and delivered via brief peer teaching. A two-fold assessment of BST was performed that included cross sectional survey to assess learner attitudes and experiences and a controlled study to assess knowledge acquisition with BST and case-based teaching control. Results One hundred and six of 171 residents (62% response rate) completed the survey. Most residents (79.8%) reported BST was among the best conference types in the curriculum. Important components of BST cited by residents include the distilled content, multiple short talk format and peer teaching. Residents report incorporating what they learned via BST into their teaching (76.1%) and clinical practice (74.1%). Resident who had participated as speaker were significantly more likely to report incorporating learning from BST into their teaching (87.2% vs 63.0%, p < 0.01, Cramer’s V effect size = 0.37) and clinical practice (89.7% vs 65.3%, p = 0.02, Cramer’s V effect size 0.28). Fifty-one residents participated in the knowledge assessment. Residents taught via BST scored significantly higher on immediate post-test compared to case-based teaching (score [SE] 62.5% [1.9] vs 55.2% [2.4], p = 0.03, Hedges g effect size 0.66). While both groups improved over pretest, there was no significant difference in scores between BST and case-based teaching at two (score [SE] 57.1 [2.1] vs 54.8 [2.5], p = 0.54) and six weeks (score [SD] 55.9 [2.1] vs 53.0 [2.9], p = 0.43). Conclusions Teaching via brief, focused learning units delivered by peers is well received by learners and appears to have a significantly greater impact on immediate knowledge recall than case-based teaching. Further study on long term knowledge retention and behaviors is needed. Bite-Sized Teaching may be a promising instructional approach in medical education.

Abstract: Despite significant efforts to ensure workers’ safety, the construction industry continues to observe high levels of injuries and fatalities. Many research efforts have identified hazard recognition as one of the main factors for a safer work environment, and safety training as its major improvement vehicle. In consideration of this issue, this foundational research is focused on understanding how effective the current training methods are. The training content, confined space safety, was specifically chosen as a more obscure topic than other common safety areas e.g. ladder safety. Participants among two different populations of students and industry professionals were tested to measure their ability to retain prompt safety information through four different training-delivery methods. The results were statistically analyzed to determine if there is a difference in participants’ knowledge retention based on which training-delivery method they received. Other variables were considered and analyzed such as education, construction experience, and safety training. Among the observed results, the study found no significance difference based on the training delivery methods. However, other factors were found significant to the participant’s safety knowledge retention such as long term learning and industry experience. Future studies were identified to build on the current research, and to include different languages.

Abstract: Single best answers (single choice, SC) are the classical tools used in medical examinations on all levels of education. In contrast, very short answer (VSA) probably requires sound prior knowledge and deeper learning than SC, and VSA should make cueing and guessing impossible. Hence, in a basic pharmacology course, we wanted to compare the SC and VSA formats directly at the end of the course and one year later. Medical students ( n  = 211) were given a formative online test. Two groups were randomly formed (A and B). Participants in group A were first given fifteen single choices (one out of five) pharmacology questions and thereafter fifteen very short answer questions (open question which were to be answered online and semiautomatically assessed). Very similar questions with regard to learning objectives but in opposite order were given to group B. After one year, about half of students from group A were again given the very same questions (AA) or the opposite questions (AB). Likewise, group B was again tested with the opposite questions (BA) or the same (BB). The SC questions in groups A, AA, AB, B, BA, and BB were in sum easier to answer than the corresponding VSA questions. Repeating the test after one year with the same students increased retention of right answers by about 1.5 points. In summary, direct comparison questions in the VSA format are more difficult for our students to answer than questions in the SC format, conceivably because cueing and guessing are eliminated. Knowledge retention is present by repeating the very same examination format online. Retention of knowledge is higher when starting with VSA (group B) both for a subsequent SC format or a VSA format. These data would argue for more use of the VSA format at least in pharmacology examinations.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has achieved significant success in various domains. However, it still faces a huge challenge when learning multiple tasks in sequence. This is because the interaction in a complex setting involves continual learning that results in the change in data distributions over time. A continual learning system should ensure that the agent acquires new knowledge without forgetting the previous one. However, catastrophic forgetting may occur as the new experience can overwrite previous experience due to limited memory size. The dual experience replay algorithm which retains previous experience is widely applied to reduce forgetting, but it cannot be applied in scalable tasks when the memory size is constrained. To alleviate the constrained by the memory size, we propose a new continual reinforcement learning algorithm called Self-generated Long-term Experience Replay (SLER). Our method is different from the standard dual experience replay algorithm, which uses short-term experience replay to retain current task experience, and the long-term experience replay retains all past tasks’ experience to achieve continual learning. In this paper, we first trained an environment sample model called Experience Replay Mode (ERM) to generate the simulated state sequence of the previous tasks for knowledge retention. Then combined the ERM with the experience of the new task to generate the simulation experience all previous tasks to alleviate forgetting. Our method can effectively decrease the requirement of memory size in multiple tasks, reinforcement learning. We show that our method in StarCraft II and the GridWorld environments performs better than the state-of-the-art deep learning method and achieve a comparable result to the dual experience replay method, which retains the experience of all the tasks.

Trigger warnings in the classroom: Assessing the roles of appraisals and stress mindsets

Abstract: Trigger warnings—notices about potentially sensitive material that might activate strong emotional or physical responses—have received polarized attention for their presence on college campuses. Some scholars argue that trigger warnings are "coddling the American mind"; whereas others argue that such warnings are essential to student success. Despite media attention, there is little empirical work on trigger warnings in the college classroom. Past research has conflicting results on the effectiveness of trigger warnings and none of these studies have fully investigated the mechanisms by which trigger warnings work. In order to address how trigger warnings function in classrooms, I conducted two studies. Study 1 was designed to collect descriptive data on students' experiences with and understanding of trigger warnings and to collect pilot data on students' mindsets about stress and appraisals of course material. Students were moderately familiar with trigger warnings and saw trigger warnings as facilitating classroom engagement. Students, on average, saw stress as debilitating and their course material as a challenge. Study 2 tested, experimentally, whether and how trigger warnings had positive or negative effects on knowledge retention and affect. Study 2 also investigated the role of stress mindset (manipulated experimentally). Overall, Study 2 tested a theoretical model, whereby appraisals explain the effect of trigger warnings on knowledge retention and affect and stress mindset moderates this effect. Receiving a trigger warning (vs. not) before viewing a video did not influence outcomes (i.e., knowledge retention and positive or negative affect). Moreover, there was no evidence to support the proposed model: appraisals did not mediate the effect of trigger warnings on outcomes and a stress mindset intervention did not moderate this (lack of) effect. Overall, these studies suggested that whereas students generally understand the purpose behind the use of trigger warnings in college classrooms (Study 1), trigger warnings—at least in the context of this experiment—had little effect on student outcomes (Study 2). Future studies should continue to investigate the influence of how course material is framed as well as mechanisms through which trigger warnings impact student outcomes.

Abstract: Boost methods for reinforcing educational content have been found to train the brain to designate information as important. A longitudinal, quasi-experimental study design evaluated the effect of an interprofessional simulated patient sepsis video with educational boosts on knowledge retention among acute care nurses at a large academic health system using linear mixed-effects modeling. Findings suggest that boost methods may impact nurse knowledge retention, potentially eliminating the need to repeat costly, traditional educational efforts.Boost methods for reinforcing educational content have been found to train the brain to designate information as important.

Identifying Ttransfer of care gaps: Electronic health record capture of perioperative handoff communications

Author: Giarrizzo-Wilson, Sharon11 Loyola University Chicago, Nursing, US

Publication info: Giarrizzo-Wilson, Sharon.

Abstract: Transitions in patient care are held together by interdisciplinary handoff communications intended to coordinate the patient's ongoing care requirements. Patients with complexity in care encumber the transfer of care process requiring a higher level of care coordination between the interdisciplinary team (Coleman, 2003; Naylor et al., 2004). While the literature is abundant on the characteristics and quality of handoff communications, it is limited on the requirements of what data is necessary for ongoing care following transfer communications (Galatzan & Carrington, 2018). This dissertation explores the verbal information transferred during Operating Room (OR) to Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) nursing handoff communications and whether the data is captured in the electronic health record (EHR) to represent the information critical to ongoing patient care and care planning. The study builds on the Kennedy Integrated Theoretical Framework (KITF) (Kennedy, 2012) integrating cognition theory, patterns of knowledge theory, and clinical communication space theory to support the human-technology characteristics within perioperative handoffs. Evidence of wisdom was present in the KITF in addition to elements of non-verbal communication patterns emerging from shared common ground contributed to the framework's expansion. To understand the contributions of the perioperative nursing interface terminology, the Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS), makes to postsurgical care transitions, the study examines nursing diagnoses, interventions, interim outcomes and goals relationships to the handoff data communicated between OR and PACU Registered Nurses. Study findings revealed a complex fragmented process of verbal communications and electronic documentation for the handoff process. While the EHR is prominent in data procurement for the handoff process, the design of handoff artifacts (e.g., paper, electronic) significantly impact the value of information received. Incomplete handoff tools or missing EHR data adds to a cycle of information decay while contributing to increase cognitive load and potentiating opportunities for information and knowledge loss. The absence of nursing diagnoses in the automation of the PNDS challenges the integrity of the language within the documentation platform and raises considerations for hierarchical representation within interface terminologies. This study reinforces literature to reconsider user requirements in the design and functionality of healthcare information technology (HIT) to enable data and information flow and preserve knowledge development. The inclusion of mobile technology, cognitive support aids including clinical decision support tools, and other HIT will further enable the effectiveness of transfer communication, knowledge development, and the safety of ongoing patient care.

Abstract: The present study investigated the effect of distributed versus crammed practice before a course deadline on the retention and transfer of knowledge, and whether learner characteristics moderate the effect. In Experiment 1, only 41% (N = 38) of the initially enrolled students worked the voluntary but recommended practice tasks. Moreover, markedly fewer students did so in the distributed condition (12%) than the crammed practice condition (29%). In Experiment 2, working the practice tasks was mandatory and more students completed them ( N = 105, i.e., 81%). Students who distributed practice clearly outperformed students who crammed practice on tests of knowledge retention and transfer five weeks after the practice deadline. No moderating effects of learner characteristics emerged. The study shows that distributed practice following knowledge acquisition is a powerful learning tool for fostering long-term retention and transfer with adults in authentic educational contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) Impact statement Laboratory studies showed that distributing learning or practice time across multiple sessions (compared to practicing in only one session in a crammed or massed fashion) enhances memory performance. We investigated the effect of distributed practice in a field experiment at the university. After having acquired statistics skills in lectures, students were encouraged to practice these skills at home with a fixed number of practice tasks either distributed on three different days (with a gap of two and five days in between, respectively), or crammed on one day. In the first study, practice at home was recommended to the students but voluntary. As a result, only few students completed these practice tasks and less did so in the distributed condition than in the crammed condition—even though all students had been reminded to do so via email. In the second study, practice was mandatory for successfully completing the course, and most students completed the tasks. Similar as in laboratory studies, students in the distributed practice condition showed a better memory performance, tested after five weeks, than students in the crammed practice condition. The positive effect emerged not only for previously practiced skills but also in new tasks. The results suggest that distributing the practice of statistics skills can be recommended to university students and teachers—at least when memory performance is tested after a longer delay.

Loss of Agroforestry: Symbolic Annihilation of Mixed Cultures in 19ᵗʰ Century Agricultural Science

Abstract: ENG English ENG There is a lot of promise seen in agroforestry—the deliberate keeping of trees on farmland in various forms and contexts. The Czechia, like many other European countries, experiences farmland soil degradation and erosion, climate and water regime changes, and biodiversity loss. Industrial agriculture with high inputs brings not only high yields but also numerous negative externalities. Mixed cultures on Czech lands were common just 150 years ago. However, they were left out of the new cadastral classification in the 19ᵗʰ century and, as this article shows, did not appear in modern agricultural (and forestry) scientific theory- represented by contemporary scholar book selection in this article. The symbolic annihilation of agroforestry cultures in the official agrarian discourse of the 19ᵗʰ century probably contributed to their disappearance from both land-use theory and practice.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The global accelerating loss of biodiversity is having immediate repercussions for ecosystems and human wellbeing, particularly in areas where people depend intimately on their natural environment for their livelihoods. Dovetailing this loss is the demise of local/traditional knowledge systems resulting from factors such as changing lifestyle and the transformation of local belief systems. While the importance of local ecological knowledge (LEK) for documentation of biodiversity and environmental change and development of management responses is well established, quantitative tools to analyze and systematically compare LEK are scarce. In this research, we analyze the complexity of local ecological knowledge used by respondents to classify locally-recognized marine species. We do so by applying a modified index of taxonomic distinctness to an ethnoichthyological classification in coastal communities in the Solomon Islands. In addition, we assess simple taxonomic diversity (richness in locally-recognized species names) by comparing taxonomies collected in 1992–1995 and 2014–2015. Results indicate that both endogenous (gender, age) and exogenous (proximity to market) factors have discernible effects on folk taxonomic knowledge in the region, with younger respondents and communities closer to a regional market center displaying a significantly lower richness of local species names. Folk taxonomic distinctness was significantly reduced closer to the regional market. The modified index of taxonomic distinctness applied in this research provides a useful tool to explore facets of local ecological knowledge in addition to simple richness of terms, and to compare across different regions and cultural backgrounds. Understanding changes in LEK is important because such knowledge enables communities who are highly dependent on living natural resources to harvest and manage resources more efficiently and also to detect and react to environmental change.

Abstract: Background: Simulation has revolutionized teaching and learning. However, traditional manikins are limited in their ability to exhibit emotions, movements, and interactive eye gaze. As a result, students struggle with immersion and may be unable to authentically relate to the patient. Intervention: We developed a new type of patient simulator called the Physical-Virtual Patients (PVP) which combines the physicality of manikins with the richness of dynamic visuals. The PVP uses spatial Augmented Reality to rear project dynamic imagery (e.g., facial expressions, ptosis, pupil reactions) on a semi-transparent physical shell. The shell occupies space and matches the dimensions of a human head. Methods: We compared two groups of third semester nursing students (N = 59) from a baccalaureate program using a between-participant design, one group interacting with a traditional high-fidelity manikin versus a more realistic PVP head. The learners had to perform a neurological assessment. We measured authenticity, urgency, and learning. Results: Learners had a more realistic encounter with the PVP patient (p = 0.046), they were more engaged with the PVP condition compared to the manikin in terms of authenticity of encounter and cognitive strategies. The PVP provoked a higher sense of urgency (p = 0.002). There was increased learning for the PVP group compared to the manikin group on the pre and post-simulation scores (p = 0.027). Conclusion: The realism of the visuals in the PVP increases authenticity and engagement which results in a greater sense of urgency and overall learning.

Abstract: Comments on an article by Lisa M. Kath et al. (see record 2021-16490-003). Kath et al. argue that we should practice what we teach in our industrial and organizational (I-O) psychology and other classes. What we teach when we cover principles of training should be incorporated into how we conduct our classes. These principles apply equally to corporate training and university instruction. Our students should not be the shoemaker’s children who fail to benefit from our knowledge about training that we as a field freely share with everyone else. I will expand upon points made by Kath et al. about applying what we know about training to the bottom-line issue of knowledge retention and how we can design our classes to maximize what our students will remember long after completing our course.

Abstract: ENG English ENG BACKGROUND: Missions were established in California in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to convert Native Americans to Christianity and enculturate them into a class of laborers for Californios (Spanish/Mexican settler). The concentration of large numbers of Native Americans at the Missions, along with the introduction of European diseases, led to serious disease problems. Medicinal supplies brought to California by the missionaries were limited in quantity. This situation resulted in an opportunity for the sharing of knowledge of medicinal plants between the Native Americans and the Mission priests. The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which such sharing of knowledge took place and to understand factors that may have influenced the sharing of medicinal knowledge. The study also examines the sharing of medicinal knowledge between the Native Americans and the Californios following the demise of the California Missions. METHODS: Two methods were employed in the study: (1) a comparison of lists of medicinal plants used by various groups (e.g., Native American, Mission priests, Californios) prior to, during, and after the Mission period and (2) a close reading of diaries, reports, and books written by first-hand observers and modern authorities to find accounts of and identify factors influencing the exchange of medicinal information. RESULTS: A comparison of the lists of medicinal plants use by various groups indicated that only a small percentage of medicinal plants were shared by two or more groups. For example, none of the 265 taxa of species used by the Native Americans in pre-Mission times were imported into Spain for medicinal use and only 16 taxa were reported to have been used at the Missions. A larger sharing of information of medicinal plants took place in the post-Mission period when Native Americans were dispersed from the Missions and worked as laborers on the ranches of the Californios. CONCLUSIONS: Sharing of information concerning medicinal plants did occur during the Mission period, but the number of documented species was limited. A number of possible factors discouraged this exchange. These include (1) imbalance of power between the priests and the Native Americans, (2) suppression of indigenous knowledge and medical practices by the Mission priests, (3) language barriers, (4) reduction of availability of medicinal herbs around the Mission due to introduced agricultural practices, (5) desire to protect knowledge of medicinal herbs by Native American shaman, (6) administrative structure at the Missions which left little time for direct interaction between the priests and individual Native Americans, (7) loss of knowledge of herbal medicine by the Native Americans over time at the Missions, and (8) limited transportation opportunities for reciprocal the shipment of medicinal plants between California and Spain. Three possible factors were identified that contributed to a greater sharing of information between the Native Americans and the Californios in the post-Mission period. These were (1) more one-to-one interactions between the Californios and the Native Americans, (2) many of the Californios were mestizos whose mothers or grandmothers were Native Americans, and (3) lack of pressure on the part of the Californios to suppress Native American beliefs and medicinal practices.

Abstract: This article aims to continue research on the issue of knowledge loss. The authors of the paper have found out earlier that in theory knowledge management helps to establish an environment of creation, development, transfer and share of intellectual capital. From their own experience, the authors of the paper have revealed different side: some companies and enterprises do not use the latest theoretical and practical achievements in the field of knowledge management. On the contrary, the excellent knowledge management initiatives fail from time to time. The explanations of these failures may be different and involve personal and organizational levels and infrastructure. A remarkable point is that most of the companies do not admit their mistakes and learn from negative experience. As a result, companies intentionally or unintentionally lose the valuable knowledge. Based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), this paper builds a hierarchical structure model of factors influencing the KM learning from failure. The study identifies: (1) the elements (the difficulties, barriers, risks, factors) affecting KM initiative connected with it stages; (2) five most discussed aspects that can be overwhelmed by proposed alternatives; (3) connection between alternatives and learning from failure.

Abstract: Purpose Testing is required in medical education. The large number of exams that students face requires effective learning strategies. Various methods of improving knowledge retention and recall have been discussed, two of the most widely evaluated of which are test-enhanced learning and pause procedures. This study investigated the effect of voluntary multiple-choice questions on students’ performance. Methods In a prospective study from April 2013 to March 2015, 721 students were randomly assigned to receive supplementary online material only (control group) or additional multiple-choice questions (investigative group) accompanying lectures. Their performance in the final exam was evaluated. Results A total of 675 students were ultimately included, with 299 randomly assigned to the investigative group and 376 to the control group. Students in the investigative group scored significantly better in relation to grades and points (2.11 vs. 2.49; 33 vs 31.31; p  < 0.05). The effect declined over time. Conclusion This is the first study of the use of voluntary multiple-choice questions to improve medical students’ performance. The results support test-enhanced learning and the feasibility of implementing multiple-choice questions in lectures.

Perceptual Knowledge, Discrimination, and Closure

Abstract: Carter and Pritchard (Philos Stud 173(4):969–990, 2016) and Pritchard (Noûs 44(2):245–268, 2010, Epistemological disjunctivism, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012, Epistemic angst: radical scepticism and the groundlessness of our believing, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2016) have tried to reconcile the intuition that perceptual knowledge requires only limited discriminatory abilities with the closure principle. To this end, they have introduced two theoretical innovations: a contrast between two ways of introducing error-possibilities and a distinction between discriminating and favoring evidence. I argue that their solution faces the “sufficiency problem”: it is unclear whether the evidence that is normally available to adult humans is sufficient to retain knowledge of the entailing proposition and come to know the entailed proposition. I submit that, on either infallibilist or fallibilist views of evidence, Carter and Pritchard have set the bar for deductive knowledge too low. At the end, I offer an alternative solution. I suggest that the knowledge-retention condition of the closure principle is not satisfied in zebra-like scenarios.

Abstract: Long-term multiple myeloma therapy by immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) raises the question of management of adverse effects. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of an educational session for patients on the acquisition of knowledge to manage hematologic and thromboembolic adverse effects of IMiDs. In this prospective single-center study, patients attended an educational session with a hospital clinical pharmacist and a nurse. The primary endpoint was the patient’s level of knowledge for the management of IMiDs adverse effects, assess with a dedicated questionnaire administered before the session then 1 and 6 months after. Assessment of knowledge was combined with self-assessment of certainty. The secondary endpoints were adherence and IMiD treatment satisfaction. 50 patients were included. Patient knowledge increased at 1 month (p<0.001) despite a loss of knowledge at 6 months (p<0.05). Six months after the educational intervention, the number of patients with skills considered satisfactory by the pharmacist and nurse increased (p<0.01). Most patients showed satisfactory adherence, with medication possession ratio ≥ 80%. The Self CARe and MEdication Toxicity (SCARMET) study highlighted the impact of multidisciplinary follow-up in multiple myeloma patients to improve knowledge of toxicity self-management.

Abstract: The present study investigated the effect of distributed versus crammed practice before a course deadline on the retention and transfer of knowledge, and whether learner characteristics moderate the effect. In Experiment 1, only 41% (N = 38) of the initially enrolled students worked the voluntary but recommended practice tasks. Moreover, markedly fewer students did so in the distributed condition (12%) than the crammed practice condition (29%). In Experiment 2, working the practice tasks was mandatory and more students completed them ( N = 105, i.e., 81%). Students who distributed practice clearly outperformed students who crammed practice on tests of knowledge retention and transfer five weeks after the practice deadline. No moderating effects of learner characteristics emerged. The study shows that distributed practice following knowledge acquisition is a powerful learning tool for fostering long-term retention and transfer with adults in authentic educational contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract) Impact statement Laboratory studies showed that distributing learning or practice time across multiple sessions (compared to practicing in only one session in a crammed or massed fashion) enhances memory performance. We investigated the effect of distributed practice in a field experiment at the university. After having acquired statistics skills in lectures, students were encouraged to practice these skills at home with a fixed number of practice tasks either distributed on three different days (with a gap of two and five days in between, respectively), or crammed on one day. In the first study, practice at home was recommended to the students but voluntary. As a result, only few students completed these practice tasks and less did so in the distributed condition than in the crammed condition—even though all students had been reminded to do so via email. In the second study, practice was mandatory for successfully completing the course, and most students completed the tasks. Similar as in laboratory studies, students in the distributed practice condition showed a better memory performance, tested after five weeks, than students in the crammed practice condition. The positive effect emerged not only for previously practiced skills but also in new tasks. The results suggest that distributing the practice of statistics skills can be recommended to university students and teachers—at least when memory performance is tested after a longer delay.

Abstract: Testing is required in medical education. The large number of exams that students face requires effective learning strategies. Various methods of improving knowledge retention and recall have been discussed, two of the most widely evaluated of which are test-enhanced learning and pause procedures. This study investigated the effect of voluntary multiple-choice questions on students' performance. PURPOSE Testing is required in medical education. The large number of exams that students face requires effective learning strategies. Various methods of improving knowledge retention and recall have been discussed, two of the most widely evaluated of which are test-enhanced learning and pause procedures. This study investigated the effect of voluntary multiple-choice questions on students' performance.In a prospective study from April 2013 to March 2015, 721 students were randomly assigned to receive supplementary online material only (control group) or additional multiple-choice questions (investigative group) accompanying lectures. Their performance in the final exam was evaluated. METHODS In a prospective study from April 2013 to March 2015, 721 students were randomly assigned to receive supplementary online material only (control group) or additional multiple-choice questions (investigative group) accompanying lectures. Their performance in the final exam was evaluated.A total of 675 students were ultimately included, with 299 randomly assigned to the investigative group and 376 to the control group. Students in the investigative group scored significantly better in relation to grades and points (2.11 vs. 2.49; 33 vs 31.31; p < 0.05). The effect declined over time. RESULTS A total of 675 students were ultimately included, with 299 randomly assigned to the investigative group and 376 to the control group. Students in the investigative group scored significantly better in relation to grades and points (2.11 vs. 2.49; 33 vs 31.31; p < 0.05). The effect declined over time.This is the first study of the use of voluntary multiple-choice questions to improve medical students' performance. The results support test-enhanced learning and the feasibility of implementing multiple-choice questions in lectures. CONCLUSION This is the first study of the use of voluntary multiple-choice questions to improve medical students' performance. The results support test-enhanced learning and the feasibility of implementing multiple-choice questions in lectures.

Abstract: Foot care education is an important strategy in reducing lower limb complications. There is evidence that contemporary communication approaches can improve patient education outcomes. To inform the potential of such methods in diabetic foot education, we trialled a collaborative approach in patient education counselling in a podiatry clinic. We conducted a single-blind pragmatic randomised controlled trial on 52 diabetes patients who had an active foot ulcer. Participants were randomised to either collaborative education or traditional didactic education. Outcomes on knowledge and self-care behaviours were collected via a pre and post study questionnaire (max score: 75). The study ended at 12 weeks or when the wound healed prior. 42 (80.7%) participants completed the study. The collaborative patient education group had a significant increase in score post-study (38.8 ± 8.5) compared to pre-study (32.8 ± 6.9; P < .001). The control group had no significant increase in score post study. The difference in scores between groups had a moderate effect size (d = 0.54). The use of a collaborative approach in patient education was able to produce significantly greater increase in knowledge retention and self-care behaviours, without the need for additional consultation time in a podiatry clinic.Foot care education is an important strategy in reducing lower limb complications.

Abstract: It is critical for medical students to retain and apply their knowledge of basic sciences to become competent prescribing physicians. Poor long-term retention is a pervasive concern. We investigated the impact of 'spaced education' teaching modules to improve knowledge retention in medical students on a topic of public health: vitamin D and its role in health and disease. It is critical for medical students to retain and apply their knowledge of basic sciences to become competent prescribing physicians METHODS: In a self-matched design, 148 medical students were randomised and evaluated on vitamin D-related topics to assess reinforced and non-reinforced knowledge in a multiple-choice question format. Initial learning and long-term retention were assessed with an estimation of Cohen's effect size at 24 and 72 weeks, respectively.

Initial learning and long-term retention were assessed with an estimation of Cohen's effect size at 24 and 72 weeks, respectively.The administration of spaced educational material significantly improved composite formative test scores at 24 weeks (p < 0.001, effect size = 1.33). Although the scores dipped, there was a retention of knowledge at 72 weeks (effect size = 0.48). RESULTS The administration of spaced educational material significantly improved composite formative test scores at 24 weeks (p < 0.001, effect size = 1.33). Although the scores dipped, there was a retention of knowledge at 72 weeks (effect size = 0.48).Spaced reinforcement and testing statistically improved knowledge retention among our medical students. Gaps in the present teaching could be bridged by motivating the students to extend their learning time by appropriate spacing intervals and to understand the relevance of course content in different scenarios as a physician. Further research could be instrumental in optimising interventions to enhance learning opportunities for medical students.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of emotional design on learners’ performance and emotions. If emotional design has any effects on learners’ performance and emotions, then we attempted to explore dimensions that are accounted for such effects. 316 Chinese university students participated in this study. The students were divided into two groups: NED group - students in this group learned material based on neutral design, and PED group - students in this group learned material based on positive design. We explored the differences between two groups in student learning performance as well as emotion. Prior knowledge, retention, and transfer tests were also carried out and outcomes were compared across two groups. In addition, student emotion was measured using a positive affect scale and biofeedback instruments. The results showed that PED group outperformed NED group on retention and transfer tests. However, insignificant difference was found between two groups on student emotion. Our results suggest that, although the effect of emotional design was insignificant on student emotion, it was significant on student learning performance (i.e. on retention and transfer tests). Based on our results, several implications were drawn and suggestions were made for educators and researchers.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/use-interactive-online-teaching-module-improved/docview/2354739601/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: The veterinary problem-based medical records lesson (Subjective-Objective-Assessment-Plan [SOAP] notes) at the University of Wisconsin, previously taught in lecture format, provides students little time for reflection. Moreover, evaluation of student-written SOAPs from subsequent courses demonstrates poor knowledge retention and application of the SOAP note structure. This article hypothesized that a virtual, interactive, case-based module would improve student SOAP-writing skills. A second-year student cohort (n = 79) was taught SOAP skills in lecture format (LECTURE-2); 2 years later, another second-year student cohort (n = 73) used the virtual module (MODULE-2). All students wrote SOAPs, which were evaluated using a standardized rubric and the cohorts' scores were compared. SOAPs were then compared between a third-year student cohort who received lecture-based SOAP instruction the year before (LECTURE-3, n = 55) and a third-year student cohort who received the virtual module (MODULE-3, n = 44). SOAP scores were significantly higher in the MODULE-2 group (Mdn = 6.5, range = 1.5-9.0) than in the LECTURE-2 group (Mdn = 5.0, range = 2.0-9.0, p = .006). Similarly, the MODULE-3 students scored higher on the differential diagnosis SOAP component than the LECTURE-3 students (Mdn = 1, range = 0-2, vs. Mdn = 0.5, range = 0-2, p = .041). Student feedback on the online module was positive. An online teaching module improved students' short- and long-term ability to write clinically appropriate SOAP notes. The findings suggest the module encouraged student engagement and reflection, leading to long-term retention and skill application.The veterinary problem-based medical records lesson (Subjective-Objective-Assessment-Plan [SOAP] notes) at the University of Wisconsin, previously taught in lecture format, provides students little time for reflection. Moreover, evaluation of student-written SOAPs from subsequent courses demonstrates poor knowledge retention and application of the SOAP note structure. This article hypothesized that a virtual, interactive, case-based module would improve student SOAP-writing skills. A second-year student cohort (n = 79) was taught SOAP skills in lecture format (LECTURE-2); 2 years later, another second-year student cohort (n = 73) used the virtual module (MODULE-2). All students wrote SOAPs, which were evaluated using a standardized rubric and the cohorts' scores were compared. SOAPs were then compared between a third-year student cohort who received lecture-based SOAP instruction the year before (LECTURE-3, n = 55) and a third-year student cohort who received the virtual module (MODULE-3, n = 44). SOAP scores were significantly higher in the MODULE-2 group (Mdn = 6.5, range = 1.5-9.0) than in the LECTURE-2 group (Mdn = 5.0, range = 2.0-9.0, p = .006). Similarly, the MODULE-3 students scored higher on the differential diagnosis SOAP component than the LECTURE-3 students (Mdn = 1, range = 0-2, vs. Mdn = 0.5, range = 0-2, p = .041). Student feedback on the online module was positive. An online teaching module improved students' short- and long-term ability to write clinically appropriate SOAP notes. The findings suggest the module encouraged student engagement and reflection, leading to long-term retention and skill application.

Abstract: Purpose Blended learning is an emerging trend across many educational settings, adopting the purposeful integration of traditional face-to-face and online teaching to establishing an engaging learning experience for the students. Blended learning provides an ideal platform for the implementation of reusable learning objects (RLOs) as a pedagogical tool to support classroom instruction. Design/methodology/approach This study had conducted a quasi-experiment followed by semi-structured interviews to determine if a blended learning approach using RLOs can enhance students’ learning in an undergraduate engineering computer-aided design (CAD) module. This study involved learners studying engineering in two different academic years. Findings Students from the first year were taught using traditional face-to-face teaching approach. The cohort of students from the subsequent year adopted a blended learning approach: face to face and access to a series of RLOs. The analysis revealed statistical evidence that the use of blended learning had a significant impact on the students' end of term exam grades in the CAD module in comparison to the students who undertook traditional face-to-face teaching approach. The qualitative findings highlighted the positive impact of RLOs on students’ learning behaviour, engagement and knowledge retention. Originality/value This study provided empirical evidence of the benefits of using RLOs as a blended learning tool in engineering domain. From a theoretical perspective, the findings highlighted the importance of good instructional design and sound theoretical underpinning of the pedagogical strategy. From a practical point of view, this study informed academics on how to improve learner's academic achievement using RLOs.

Abstract: Laboratory diagnostic testing service delivery and compliance with international standards for laboratory quality are directly influenced by laboratory workforce competency. Many hospital laboratories in constrained resource settings such as Cambodia struggle to cope with the training needs of laboratory professionals in an environment of competing healthcare development priorities. Resource-limited countries need an adaptable and effective approach to provide laboratory professionals with job-specific quality oversight training to ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of diagnostic services. BACKGROUND Laboratory diagnostic testing service delivery and compliance with international standards for laboratory quality are directly influenced by laboratory workforce competency. Many hospital laboratories in constrained resource settings such as Cambodia struggle to cope with the training needs of laboratory professionals in an environment of competing healthcare development priorities. Resource-limited countries need an adaptable and effective approach to provide laboratory professionals with job-specific quality oversight training to ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of diagnostic services.Here, we describe the results of an in-service training and mentoring program conducted with the Cambodia Ministry of Health at 12 tertiary-level hospital laboratories to drive improvements in laboratory quality management systems toward ISO 15189 accreditation, which demonstrated significant progress between baseline and outcome audits in a concurrent study. This case study describes the program, and evaluates how the four primary activities, including actionable gap assessments and planning, centralized and in situ training curriculum, in-person mentoring, and remote tele-mentoring via video communication technologies, contributed towards quality improvement in the participating laboratories. We evaluated participant responses to Likert scale and free response questions from program and training evaluation surveys, and we used thematic analysis to develop a model of best practices within the program's four primary activities to inform future training approaches. Of these activities, participants agreed most highly that in-person visits and planning based on gap assessments contributed to their learning and ability to improve laboratory operations. Tele-mentoring was rated lowest by participants, who were critical of excessive group dialogue and distraction during web-conferencing; however, feedback suggests both in-person and remote mentoring contribute to continuing education, accountability to action, and peer collaboration and problem solving to improve workforce efforts toward improved quality management systems.

Abstract: A significant body of literature testifies to the effectiveness of role-play gaming and simulations as pedagogical methods in political science. Many of these studies involve students with a Western background. In contrast, little research exists on the teaching of political science in China and none on the effectiveness of simulations for teaching Chinese students. This study seeks to investigate the efficacy of role-play simulations as a method for teaching comparative politics to Chinese students. The study examined the levels of long-term knowledge retention, enthusiasm towards political science, and self-reported learning outcomes in two groups of students. A test group, students who had completed at least one political science course, participated in a politics-based role-playing simulation; the control group, students who had completed the same political science course, did not participate in a comparable game. The test group displayed significantly better self-reported learning outcomes and significantly better knowledge retention than the control group (albeit at the 90 percent level).

Abstract: The objective of this literature review and evaluation project was to determine what evidence exists on the use of interactive digital learning and gamification for adult learners in nursing, for the purpose of guiding a redesign of our organization’s online clinical education courses. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used in the literature search, with the critical analysis and leveling of evidence. After determining the search terms, four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, and Cochrane) were searched with the guidance of a medical librarian. Eight reviewers participated, and an evidence-based practice specialist served as auditor. Twenty-three articles were included in the review, which revealed overall support for the gamification process with specific findings about optimizing the process. The review further suggested that interactive digital learning in the form of games, gamification, or scenario-based learning has a positive effect on learner engagement and satisfaction; however, none of the studies were able to quantify objective data about knowledge retention. Further research is needed to test different modalities that improve both learner engagement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: On reviewing our teaching methods through students' feedback, we realized they were dissatisfied with the present teaching methodology of lectures in terms of knowledge retention and problem-solving. This issue was addressed using student-centred and cooperative learning methodology, i.e. process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) where pre-designed questions guide students to enquire concepts, with reflection writing exercise helping students to strengthen their concepts. This study analysed the effectiveness and perceptions of POGIL sessions conducted after lectures.

This issue was addressed using student-centred and cooperative learning methodology, i.e. process-oriented guided inquiry learning (POGIL) where pre-designed questions guide students to enquire concepts, with reflection writing exercise helping students to strengthen their concepts. This study analysed the effectiveness and perceptions of POGIL sessions conducted after lectures.The study was approved by the institutional ethical committee. A total of 42 (7 groups; each group with 6 members of high, low and average achievers) consented and POGIL-sensitized MBBS phase I students were part of the study. One-hour POGIL sessions were conducted a week after lecturing with reading material. Pre-, post- and retention test multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were administered for assessment of effectiveness and a close-ended questionnaire for recording perception. Methods The study was approved by the institutional ethical committee. A total of 42 (7 groups; each group with 6 members of high, low and average achievers) consented and POGIL-sensitized MBBS phase I students were part of the study. One-hour POGIL sessions were conducted a week after lecturing with reading material. Pre-, post- and retention test multiple-choice questions (MCQs) were administered for assessment of effectiveness and a close-ended questionnaire for recording perception.Post-test and retention test MCQ scores were statistically higher than pre-test scores both in all participants and low achievers (p<0.05). Around 60% of the students felt that the POGIL activities and working in teams helped them to understand concepts. Reflection analysis revealed the best and least understood concept and students came up with memory aids to remember complex metabolic regulation. Results Post-test and retention test MCQ scores were statistically higher than pre-test scores both in all participants and low achievers (p<0.05). Around 60% of the students felt that the POGIL activities and working in teams helped them to understand concepts.

Abstract: Weekly quizzes are a popular method to assess student learning. Their use may increase knowledge retention via the testing effect and encourage spaced rather than massed study habits. We sought to understand the effects of weekly quizzes in a graduate-level systems physiology course. This study encompasses two academic years, 2018-2019 (Year 1, n=27) and 2019-2020 (Year 2, n=28). Four independent course units were utilized, with weekly quizzes and an end-of-unit summative exam administered during two units and just an end-of-unit exam administered during the other two units. Quizzes consisted of lower-level questions (remember, understand) while exams contained higher-level questions (apply, analyze). When weekly quizzes were not administered, lower-level questions were added to the unit exam. Identical quiz and exam questions were used for both years of the study. Treatments were reversed between Year 1 and Year 2 to account for variations in unit difficulty (Table 1). Study time was tracked via weekly student surveys. We observed a difference in quiz and exam scores between units; however, there were no differences from Year 1 and Year 2 within units. Overall weekly and non-exam week study time differed across units in Year 1, with increased study time in the first unit with quizzes. This same effect was not observed in Year 2. Between years, overall weekly and non-exam week study time was greater when quizzes were administered but only for the first unit of the year. No differences were observed between units or years in exam week study time. In both Year 1 and Year 2, hours studied per week correlated strongly with exam administration (r > 0.9) but not with quiz administration (r < 0.2). Overall, these data suggest that weekly quizzes may not enhance academic performance. They may help regulate weekly study time, but do not prevent "cramming'" before exams.

Abstract: Do children understand the cognitive changes that happen with development? Two experiments examined whether 4- and 6-year-olds understand that, as time passes, children forget some of the things they currently know. In Experiment 1, children were taught the names of a new person and a new object and then were informed that contact with these items will discontinue. Children were asked whether they would know the names tomorrow and as grown-ups. Both age groups demonstrated awareness that forgetting might occur. In Experiment 2, children showed a similar pattern of judgments about a peer’s knowledge. The findings suggest that knowledge loss is integral to children’s future thinking and is part of their understanding of the mind as a dynamically changing system.

Abstract: Medicinal plants have widely been used in the traditional treatment of ailments and have been proven effective. Their contribution still holds an important place in modern drug discovery due to their chemical, and biological diversities. However, the poor documentation of traditional medicine, in developing African countries for instance, can lead to the loss of knowledge related to such practices. In this study, we present the Eastern Africa Natural Products Database (EANPDB) containing the structural and bioactivity information of 1870 unique molecules isolated from about 300 source species from the Eastern African region. This represents the largest collection of natural products (NPs) from this geographical region, covering literature data of the period from 1962 to 2019. The computed physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles of each compound have been included. A comparative analysis of some physico‐chemical properties like molecular weight, H‐bond donor/acceptor, logP o/w , etc. as well scaffold diversity analysis has been carried out with other published NP databases. EANPDB was combined with the previously published Northern African Natural Products Database (NANPDB), to form a merger African Natural Products Database (ANPDB), containing ∼6500 unique molecules isolated from about 1000 source species (freely available at http://african‐compounds.org ) . As a case study, latrunculins A and B isolated from the sponge Negombata magnifica (Podospongiidae) with previously reported antitumour activities, were identified via substructure searching as molecules to be explored as putative binders of histone deacetylases (HDACs).

Abstract: Although cancer is seen in every state in the United States, it does not affect every geographic area and population equally. Kentucky has the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the country, with an unusually high number of cases localized in its Appalachian region. Risk factors such as sun exposure, tobacco use, poor diet/exercise, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare centers contribute to this disparity. Because education levels in the area are low, cancer literacy (defined as how well a person can understand the advice of a healthcare professional and make appropriate lifestyle decisions) also is low. In this study, we examined the short-term and long-term effects of a brief cancer-related intervention on the cancer literacy of Kentucky middle and high school students. OBJECTIVES Although cancer is seen in every state in the United States, it does not affect every geographic area and population equally. Kentucky has the highest cancer incidence and mortality rates in the country, with an unusually high number of cases localized in its Appalachian region. Risk factors such as sun exposure, tobacco use, poor diet/exercise, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare centers contribute to this disparity. Because education levels in the area are low, cancer literacy (defined as how well a person can understand the advice of a healthcare professional and make appropriate lifestyle decisions) also is low. In this study, we examined the short-term and long-term effects of a brief cancer-related intervention on the cancer literacy of Kentucky middle and high school students.This study targeted middle and high school students in Kentucky. We administered an online 10-item cancer literacy pretest, followed by a brief educational intervention and a posttest to 164 students at six Kentucky middle and high schools. This posttest also included questions asking how likely students would be to change their habits or to encourage others to change their habits as a result of the intervention. All of the participating students also were sent a 3-month follow-up online survey with items identical to the pretest; 48 students completed the 3-month follow-up test, leading to a response rate of 29.2%. The data were summarized as frequencies, averages, median, and confidence intervals (CIs) of correctly marked answers. A paired t test was used to test for significance.

The data were summarized as frequencies, averages, median, and confidence intervals (CIs) of correctly marked answers. A paired t test was used to test for significance.We observed an increase in the overall average test score from 50.2% (95% CI 47.8%-52.6%) on the pretest to 77.1% (95% CI 74.6%-79.7%) on the posttest immediately following the intervention. There also was an increase in the average number of correct responses on each item. The 3-month follow-up test similarly showed average test score improvement (75.4%). When asked how likely students would be to change their habits as a result of the intervention on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = extremely unlikely, 10 = extremely likely), the median was 6. When asked how likely students would be to encourage another to change their habits, the median was an 8. RESULTS We observed an increase in the overall average test score from 50.2% (95% CI 47.8%-52.6%) on the pretest to 77.1% (95% CI 74.6%-79.7%) on the posttest immediately following the intervention.

When asked how likely students would be to encourage another to change their habits, the median was an 8.These results provide evidence that a brief educational intervention can increase cancer literacy, improve cancer knowledge retention, and encourage behavior change in Appalachian Kentucky students. Increasing cancer literacy may result in increased participation in preventive cancer screenings and improved health habits, which could ultimately lower cancer rates in the region. CONCLUSIONS These results provide evidence that a brief educational intervention can increase cancer literacy, improve cancer knowledge retention, and encourage behavior change in Appalachian Kentucky students. Increasing cancer literacy may result in increased participation in preventive cancer screenings and improved health habits, which could ultimately lower cancer rates in the region.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a game show-based curriculum improves obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) residents' confidence in and understanding of the principles of reproductive infectious disease (RID), clinical manifestations and sequelae of sexually transmitted infection (STI), and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a game show-based curriculum improves obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) residents' confidence in and understanding of the principles of reproductive infectious disease (RID), clinical manifestations and sequelae of sexually transmitted infection (STI), and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs.A game show-based curriculum was developed from the basic principles of RID, which include the following: (1) distinguishing between clinical manifestations of STIs and management of long-term sequelae of STIs; (2) evaluation and management of common gynecologic infectious diseases, including chronic vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other pelvic infections; (3) diagnosis and management of perinatal infectious diseases, such as parvovirus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasmosis, and infection-mediated prematurity; (4) evaluation and management of obstetric and gynecologic postoperative infections; and (5) diagnosis and management of acute and chronic human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections in pregnancy. OBGYN residents at a large urban academic training program were randomized to either a Jeopardy -style educational game show intervention plus a traditional didactic-based curriculum or traditional didactic-based curriculum alone. The study team recruited participants by sending out an e-mail to all of the residents, detailing the study and consent process. Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4 weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data.

Participants from both the intervention and control groups completed confidence and knowledge-based pretests. Posttests were administered 4 weeks after completion of the pretests. Statistical methods were applied to analyze the data.Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy -style game show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional didactic-based curriculum (n = 19). All of the participants (100%) completed the pre- and posttests. Pretest median scores were similar between both groups, in which the Jeopardy group had a median score of 48.5 and the traditional group had a median score of 51.4 ( P = 0.091). The Jeopardy group median test scores improved between the pretest and posttest (48.5 vs 62.8, P ≤ 0.001). The traditional didactic-based curriculum had a minimal increase in its median posttest scores (51.4 compared with 54.2, P = 0.773). The Jeopardy group had significantly higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional didactic-based curriculum ( Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P = 0.002). RESULTS Thirty-eight residents were randomized to a Jeopardy-style game show-based educational intervention (n = 19) or to a traditional didactic-based curriculum (n = 19).

The Jeopardy group had significantly higher posttest median scores and confidence scores than the traditional didactic-based curriculum (Jeopardy = 62.8, traditional = 54.2, P = 0.002).A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents' confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents. CONCLUSIONS A game show-based curriculum improves OBGYN residents' confidence and retention of knowledge regarding RIDs, clinical manifestations and sequelae of STIs, and management of serious long-term consequences of STIs. Additional studies that include longer posttest time intervals are needed to assess the longer-term impact of game show-based curriculum on knowledge retention among OBGYN residents.

Abstract: Nurse educators may experience challenges (eg, distracted learners, inability to provide immediate feedback) when teaching in a classroom setting. Further, the perioperative workforce is multigenerational-younger staff members may have started using technology on a daily basis at a young age, so they may become distracted during traditional lectures and not retain important information. Online game-based learning (GBL) platforms are one technological solution that perioperative educators can use to maintain student engagement and foster learning. Educators at an academic medical center used an online GBL platform to develop presentations on instrument sterilization and surgical attire with sterile technique. At the conclusion of the sessions, the participants submitted surveys evaluating the teaching method. The survey results showed that the respondents found the GBL program to be a fun and positive interactive learning experience. Nurse educators should consider using this type of technology to improve participation and knowledge retention when developing educational programs.

Abstract: The objective of this literature review and evaluation project was to determine what evidence exists on the use of interactive digital learning and gamification for adult learners in nursing, for the purpose of guiding a redesign of our organization's online clinical education courses. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used in the literature search, with the critical analysis and leveling of evidence. After determining the search terms, four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, and Cochrane) were searched with the guidance of a medical librarian. Eight reviewers participated, and an evidence-based practice specialist served as auditor. Twenty-three articles were included in the review, which revealed overall support for the gamification process with specific findings about optimizing the process. The review further suggested that interactive digital learning in the form of games, gamification, or scenario-based learning has a positive effect on learner engagement and satisfaction; however, none of the studies were able to quantify objective data about knowledge retention. Further research is needed to test different modalities that improve both learner engagement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: Purpose Ultrasound technology is used to supplement gross anatomy instruction in many medical sciences programs. However, this technology is not common practice for anatomy instruction in nonmedical graduate-level courses. Ultrasound sessions provide a clear view of local anatomy and could help graduate students transfer anatomical content from a didactic context onto a living, moving body. This approach to instruction complements the rapidly evolving technological advances in science education and may assist with spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and student engagement. The main objective of this article was to describe the methods used to incorporate ultrasound sessions into a graduate level gross anatomy course. Methods The goal of the curricula was to use ultrasound technology to create a supplemental hands-on and engaging method of learning anatomy that would appeal to graduate students and possibly reinforce content. Graduate students participated in three interactive, 2-h-long ultrasound sessions that corresponded to their gross anatomy lecture material. Results Questionnaire results showed that students overwhelmingly believed that the ultrasound sessions were beneficial and that ultrasound technology should be used for anatomical instruction in graduate programs. While students found the sessions to be helpful, they sought more and longer sessions with smaller group sizes. Conclusion Overall, this article describes the methods used to incorporate multimodal learning into a graduate level anatomy course and found that students supported the methods as a potentially effective and engaging way to supplement traditional gross anatomy lectures and practical laboratory sessions.

Abstract: Medicinal plants have widely been used in the traditional treatment of ailments and have been proven effective. Their contribution still holds an important place in modern drug discovery due to their chemical, and biological diversities. However, the poor documentation of traditional medicine, in developing African countries for instance, can lead to the loss of knowledge related to such practices. In this study, we present the Eastern Africa Natural Products Database (EANPDB) containing the structural and bioactivity information of 1870 unique molecules isolated from about 300 source species from the Eastern African region. This represents the largest collection of natural products (NPs) from this geographical region, covering literature data of the period from 1962 to 2019. The computed physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles of each compound have been included. A comparative analysis of some physico-chemical properties like molecular weight, H-bond donor/acceptor, logP o/w , etc. as well scaffold diversity analysis has been carried out with other published NP databases. EANPDB was combined with the previously published Northern African Natural Products Database (NANPDB), to form a merger African Natural Products Database (ANPDB), containing ∼6500 unique molecules isolated from about 1000 source species (freely available at http://african-compounds.org). As a case study, latrunculins A and B isolated from the sponge Negombata magnifica (Podospongiidae) with previously reported antitumour activities, were identified via substructure searching as molecules to be explored as putative binders of histone deacetylases (HDACs).Medicinal plants have widely been used in the traditional treatment of ailments and have been proven effective.

Abstract: Few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have robust emergency medical services (EMS). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends scaling-up lay first responder programs as the first step toward formal EMS development. INTRODUCTION Few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have robust emergency medical services (EMS). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends scaling-up lay first responder programs as the first step toward formal EMS development.We trained and equipped 4,529 lay first responders (LFRs) between June-December 2019 in Bombali District, Sierra Leone, with a 5-hour hands-on, contextually-adapted prehospital trauma course to cover 535,000 people. Instructors trained 1,029 LFRs and 50 local trainers in a training-of-trainers (TOT) model, who then trained an additional 3,500 LFRs. A validated, 23-question pre-/post-test measured knowledge improvement, while six- and nine-month follow-up tests measured knowledge retention. Incident reports tracked patient encounters to assess longitudinal impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS We trained and equipped 4,529 lay first responders (LFRs) between June-December 2019 in Bombali District, Sierra Leone, with a 5-hour hands-on, contextually-adapted prehospital trauma course to cover 535,000 people. Instructors trained 1,029 LFRs and 50 local trainers in a training-of-trainers (TOT) model, who then trained an additional 3,500 LFRs. A validated, 23-question pre-/post-test measured knowledge improvement, while six- and nine-month follow-up tests measured knowledge retention. Incident reports tracked patient encounters to assess longitudinal impact.Median pre-/post-test scores improved by 43.5 percentage points (34.8% vs. 78.3%, p<0.0001). Knowledge retention was assessed at six months, with median score dropping to 60.9%, while at nine months, median score dropped to 43.5%. Lay first responders participating in courses led by TOT trainers had a pre-/post-test median score improvement of 30.4 percentage points (21.7% vs. 52.2%, p<0.0001). LFRs treated 1,850 patients over six months, most frequently utilizing hemorrhage control skills in 61.2% of encounters (1,133/1,850). The plurality of patients were young adult males (36.8%) and 48.7% of encounters were motorcycle injury-related. RESULTS Median pre-/post-test scores improved by 43.5 percentage points (34.8% vs. 78.3%, p<0.0001).

The plurality of patients were young adult males (36.8%) and 48.7% of encounters were motorcycle injury-related.A 5-hour first responder course targeting laypeople demonstrates significant emergency care knowledge improvement and retention. By training networks of transportation providers, lay first responder programs represent a robust and scalable prehospital emergency care alternative for low-resource settings. CONCLUSION A 5-hour first responder course targeting laypeople demonstrates significant emergency care knowledge improvement and retention.

Abstract: Pharmacy faculty have the often difficult task of translating and incorporating existing concepts and advances from the foundational sciences into the clinical sciences and practice. This commentary focuses on content integration as a curricular and educational strategy, outcomes data from integration, and recommendations for programs employing or considering curricular integration. INTRODUCTION Pharmacy faculty have the often difficult task of translating and incorporating existing concepts and advances from the foundational sciences into the clinical sciences and practice. This commentary focuses on content integration as a curricular and educational strategy, outcomes data from integration, and recommendations for programs employing or considering curricular integration.Integration of foundational and clinical sciences across the curriculum has been emphasized in accreditation standards but met with mixed reactions by faculty across different disciplines in the academy. Many pharmacy programs have already incorporated some level of integration in didactic courses. However, most report coordination of curricular delivery rather than higher levels of integration in which different disciplines work together to design and deliver instructional materials across the entire curriculum. COMMENTARY Integration of foundational and clinical sciences across the curriculum has been emphasized in accreditation standards but met with mixed reactions by faculty across different disciplines in the academy. Many pharmacy programs have already incorporated some level of integration in didactic courses. However, most report coordination of curricular delivery rather than higher levels of integration in which different disciplines work together to design and deliver instructional materials across the entire curriculum.Curricular integration models should be optimized to minimize or eliminate the risks of marginalization of foundational sciences in pharmacy curricula. A significant problem in implementing curricular integration is determining the appropriate balance between foundational and clinical sciences. Well-designed curricular integration with ongoing reinforcement that builds in complexity over time could enhance knowledge retention, critical thinking abilities, and clinical decision making. Further research is needed into the outcomes achieved from various integrated curricular approaches in pharmacy education.

Abstract: Do children understand the cognitive changes that happen with development? Two experiments examined whether 4- and 6-year-olds understand that, as time passes, children forget some of the things they currently know. In Experiment 1, children were taught the names of a new person and a new object and then were informed that contact with these items will discontinue. Children were asked whether they would know the names tomorrow and as grown-ups. Both age groups demonstrated awareness that forgetting might occur. In Experiment 2, children showed a similar pattern of judgments about a peer's knowledge. The findings suggest that knowledge loss is integral to children's future thinking and is part of their understanding of the mind as a dynamically changing system.Do children understand the cognitive changes that happen with development?

Abstract: Ultrasound technology is used to supplement gross anatomy instruction in many medical sciences programs. However, this technology is not common practice for anatomy instruction in nonmedical graduate-level courses. Ultrasound sessions provide a clear view of local anatomy and could help graduate students transfer anatomical content from a didactic context onto a living, moving body. This approach to instruction complements the rapidly evolving technological advances in science education and may assist with spatial understanding, knowledge retention, and student engagement. The main objective of this article was to describe the methods used to incorporate ultrasound sessions into a graduate level gross anatomy course.

The main objective of this article was to describe the methods used to incorporate ultrasound sessions into a graduate level gross anatomy course.The goal of the curricula was to use ultrasound technology to create a supplemental hands-on and engaging method of learning anatomy that would appeal to graduate students and possibly reinforce content. Graduate students participated in three interactive, 2-h-long ultrasound sessions that corresponded to their gross anatomy lecture material. METHODS The goal of the curricula was to use ultrasound technology to create a supplemental hands-on and engaging method of learning anatomy that would appeal to graduate students and possibly reinforce content. Graduate students participated in three interactive, 2-h-long ultrasound sessions that corresponded to their gross anatomy lecture material.Questionnaire results showed that students overwhelmingly believed that the ultrasound sessions were beneficial and that ultrasound technology should be used for anatomical instruction in graduate programs. While students found the sessions to be helpful, they sought more and longer sessions with smaller group sizes. RESULTS Questionnaire results showed that students overwhelmingly believed that the ultrasound sessions were beneficial and that ultrasound technology should be used for anatomical instruction in graduate programs. While students found the sessions to be helpful, they sought more and longer sessions with smaller group sizes.Overall, this article describes the methods used to incorporate multimodal learning into a graduate level anatomy course and found that students supported the methods as a potentially effective and engaging way to supplement traditional gross anatomy lectures and practical laboratory sessions. CONCLUSION Overall, this article describes the methods used to incorporate multimodal learning into a graduate level anatomy course and found that students supported the methods as a potentially effective and engaging way to supplement traditional gross anatomy lectures and practical laboratory sessions.

Abstract: The objective of the study described in this article was to examine whether, and to what extent, Australian public hospitals use knowledge terminology, i.e. a body of knowledge-related terms, on their websites. The paper also discusses the difference in the level of such communication between large and small hospitals, the factors affecting the use of the knowledge-related terms in the communication and the similarities/differences between the use of knowledge terms in Australian public hospitals and large/small companies in Australia. BACKGROUND The objective of the study described in this article was to examine whether, and to what extent, Australian public hospitals use knowledge terminology, i.e. a body of knowledge-related terms, on their websites. The paper also discusses the difference in the level of such communication between large and small hospitals, the factors affecting the use of the knowledge-related terms in the communication and the similarities/differences between the use of knowledge terms in Australian public hospitals and large/small companies in Australia.151 Australian public hospitals were included in the research sample: 51 large and 100 small hospitals. Using the method of content analysis, websites mentioning knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge implementation, and knowledge retention were identified, along with the number of these mentions. Descriptive statistics and chi square test of independence were used to provide answers to four research questions. METHODS 151 Australian public hospitals were included in the research sample: 51 large and 100 small hospitals. Using the method of content analysis, websites mentioning knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge implementation, and knowledge retention were identified, along with the number of these mentions. Descriptive statistics and chi square test of independence were used to provide answers to four research questions.Of the 151 hospitals included in the sample, 30 had no website and 62 (50 small and 12 large) had a single page website. The study found that there are differences between Australian public hospitals regarding the level of their knowledge communication on their websites, both between small and large hospitals and between the individual hospitals within the large and small hospital groups. RESULTS Of the 151 hospitals included in the sample, 30 had no website and 62 (50 small and 12 large) had a single page website. The study found that there are differences between Australian public hospitals regarding the level of their knowledge communication on their websites, both between small and large hospitals and between the individual hospitals within the large and small hospital groups.A well-known saying goes "For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of". Effective communication of knowledge-related terminologies to both internal and external stakeholders, i.e. the parties who access the websites, is therefore an indication of a knowledge focus in the public hospitals. Large hospitals are generally more active in communicating knowledge terms, although there are some exceptions. Some of the small hospitals can lead by example, but most of them do not include knowledge terminology in their communication on websites. CONCLUSIONS A well-known saying goes "For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of". Effective communication of knowledge-related terminologies to both internal and external stakeholders, i.e. the parties who access the websites, is therefore an indication of a knowledge focus in the public hospitals.

Abstract: Simulation and Objective Structured Clinical Examination assessment of learners can teach clinical skills proficiency in a safe environment without risk to patients. Interprofessional simulation-based education (IPSE) contributes to a transformation in students' understanding of teamwork and professional roles. Long term outcomes for stimulation and IPSE sessions, are less well studied. We hypothesized that a progressive interprofessional education simulation program incorporating both faculty and interprofessional student collaboration would improve medical students' knowledge retention, comfort with procedural skills, positive teamwork and respectful interaction between students.An Obstetrics and Gynecology IPSE for medical and nursing students (NS) was developed in collaboration between a school of medicine and a school of nursing from 2014 to 2017. By 2017, content includedFrom 2014 to 2016, medical students completed attitude, knowledge, and perception surveys both pre and immediately post simulation, at 4 months, and 8 months. In 2017; all students completed self-assessments and received faculty-assessments.The program trained 443 medical and 136 NS. Medical students' knowledge, comfort, and interest increased significantly post simulation. Outcome scores decreased but were still significantly improved at 4 months but nearly dissipated by 8 months. There were no significant differences between medical and NS self-assessment or faculty-assessment scores regarding IUD insertion, cervical examination, or contraception quiz scores. Medical students' birth simulation self-assessment versus faculty-assessment scores were 8.6 vs 8.9, P < .001.Simulation improved students' short-term medical knowledge, comfort, and perception with some long-term persistence at 4-8 months. Medical and NS learned obstetrics and gynecology skills in a collaborative environment and in role-specific situations. Medical students had the opportunity to learn from NS. Positive teamwork and respectful interaction occurred between the students.Simulation and Objective Structured Clinical Examination assessment of learners can teach clinical skills proficiency in a safe environment without risk to patients.

Abstract: According to the Joint Monitoring Programme, the gap between the richest and poorest has been reduced in 52 countries but increased in 22 countries—mostly countries emerging from conflict (UNICEF/WHO, 2019, p. 34). [...]Part 4 addresses the role non-conventional small-scale or decentralized sanitation can play in providing equitable access to sustainable sanitation services. (i) CWIS Concept Citywide inclusive sanitation as a concept is being continuously refined through on-going debate, practice and implementation. The authors provide available evidence on these three areas, including fecal contamination risks associated with onsite, decentralized and centralized systems in urban living environments, integration of climate change impacts such as flooding into sanitation planning, and use of cost effectiveness analysis against consistent service objectives to support improved comparison of the mix of sanitation options likely to be appropriate to different contexts across a city. ii) Methods Citywide inclusive sanitation as a novel approach to urban sanitation requires an array of new tools and methods to provide answers for planning and programming non-conventional sanitation solutions. The 2-year field research revealed that the high turnover of government staff affected institutional knowledge retention, acceptance and continuity and ultimately the potential to engage in a successful planning exercise. Because baseline data was outdated or non-existent, data collection activities consumed unexpected amounts of time.

Completion of multiview missing data based on multi-manifold regularised non-negative matrix factorisation

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/completion-multiview-missing-data-based-on-multi/docview/3195888690/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In multi-source data analysis, the absence of data values or attributes is inevitably brought about by various influencing factors including environment, which results in the loss of knowledge to be conveyed by data. To solve the problem of missing data in multi-source data analysis, completion method for multiview missing data based on multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization was proposed in this paper. This method was based on the assumption of consistency of the multiview data and an algorithm of multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization is adopted to obtain homogeneous manifold and global clustering. On this basis, a multiview synergistic discrimination model is built of the non-missing view that referred to the Gaussian mixture model to pre-mark the clustering that the incremental missing data belonged to. Using the consistency of each view in the low-dimensional space, a prediction model of missing data at the specified view is established using the multiple linear regression technique to achieve accurate data completion under conditions of missing multi-attributes. Through the establishment of data filling model with three handling methods for missing values, namely CMMD-MNMF, FIMUS and Hot deck, the completion performance, clustering performance and classification performance of data sets including UCI, Flower17 and Flower102 are analyzed by simulation experiments. As shown in the results, the method of multi-view data missing completion is verified to be effective.

Abstract: This experimental study examined the design and effectiveness of embodied interactions for learning. The researchers designed a digital learning environment integrating body joint mapping sensor s to teach novice learners Chinese characters, and examined whether the embodied interaction would lead to greater knowledge acquisition in language learning compared to the conventional mouse -based interaction. Fifty-three adult learners were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The study adopted a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest on knowledge acquisition. Although higher scores were found for the embodied interaction group in both posttests, only the delayed posttest showed a statistically significant group difference. The findings suggested that active embodied actions lead to better knowledge retention compared with the passive visual embodiment. The body-moving process works as an alternative and complementary encoding strategy for character understanding and memorization by associating the semantic meaning of a character with the construction of a body posture.

Abstract: Despite extensive research, measurable benefits of predictive policing are scarce. We argue that powerful models might not always help the work of officers. Furthermore, developed models are oft en un-explainable, leading to trust issues between police intuition and machine-made prediction. We use a joint approach, mixing criminology and data science knowledge, to design an explainable predictive policing model. The proposed model (a set of explainable decision trees) can predict police resource requirement across the city and explain this prediction based on human-understandable cues (i.e., past event information, weather, and socio-demographic information). The explainable decision tree is then compared to a non-explainable model (i.e., a neural network) to compare performance. Analyzing the decision tree behaviour revealed multiple relations with established criminology knowledge. Weather and recent event distribution were found to be the most useful predictors of police workforce resource. Despite wide research showing relationships between socio-demographic information and police activity, socio-demographic in-formation did not contribute much to the model’s performance. Though there is a lack of research on measurable effects of predictive policing applications, we argue that combining human instinct with machine prediction reduces risks of human knowledge loss, machine bias, and lack of confidence in the system.

Nous soutenons que les modèles puissants n’aident pas toujours le travail des agents de police. De plus, les modèles développés sont souvent inexplicables, entraînant des problèmes de confi ance entre l’in-tuition policière et les prédictions faites par des machines. Nous utilisons une approche double, mélangeant la criminologie et les connaissances de la science des données, pour concevoir un modèle du maintien de l’ordre prédictif explicable. Le modèle proposé (un groupe d’arbres de décisions explicables) peut prévoir les ressources policières requises partout dans la ville et expliquer cette prédiction selon des facteurs compréhensibles par les humains (p. ex. : des renseignements sur des événements antérieurs, la météo, des renseignements sociodémographiques). L’arbre de décisions explicables est ensuite comparé à un modèle non explicable (c.-à-d. un réseau neuronal) pour comparer les performances. L’analyse du comportement de l’arbre de décision dévoile de multiples relations avec une connaissance établie en criminologie. La météo et la distribution d’événements récents se sont dévoilés comme étant les prédicteurs les plus utiles pour les ressources policières. Malgré de vastes recherches montrant les relations entre les renseignements sociodémographiques et les activités policières, ces renseignements n’ont pas vraiment contribué à la per-formance du modèle. Bien qu’il y ait un manque de recherche sur les eff ets mesurables de l’application du maintien de l’ordre prédictif, nous soutenons qu’une combinaison de l’instinct humain et de la prédiction machine réduit le risque de perte de connaissances humaines, de préjugés contre les machines et de perdre confi ance dans le système.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the antecedents, levers of control and outcomes of organizational unlearning and forgetting in new product development (NPD) teams. Design/methodology/approach This paper employs a holistic multiple-case study design. This paper gathered data from 30 individual semi-structured interviews in 10 different NPD teams as well as additional data to triangulate the findings. Findings The authors propose a model of unlearning and forgetting elements occurring in NPD teams. The two most prominent factors that hamper innovation are the inability to unlearn and involuntary forgetting. Failure to manage these antecedents results in the loss of crucial resources, missing innovations or intra-team tensions. Managing knowledge loss by promoting unlearning and reducing forgetting leads to enhanced creativity and flexibility, a higher chance of exceeding innovation goals, increased conversion efficiency and augmentation of existing knowledge. Research limitations/implications This paper contributes empirical evidence to the field of unlearning and forgetting. The model illustrates the NPD process from the perspective of organizational unlearning and forgetting. The authors examined the NPD process from an unlearning and forgetting perspective and proposed new categories of antecedents, consequences and managing unlearning and forgetting. This generates a more profound theoretical understanding of underlying knowledge loss processes in NPD teams. Practical implications Companies should promote unlearning and specify spatial and temporal freedom. In doing so, team members can identify outdated and obsolete knowledge. Being attentive to unlearning and forgetting processes allows teams to achieve increased creativity and flexibility. Originality/value This paper provides empirical evidence to generate a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms of knowledge loss in NPD teams. First, the authors propose a holistic model of antecedents, levers of control and consequences of both unlearning and forgetting. Second, the authors suggest that organizations can use these levers of control to successfully manage unlearning and forgetting in NPD teams.

Abstract: Internationally, various warfarin education strategies have been described in the medical literature and delivered by a variety of health-care providers. However, none of these were tested in a Saudi setting. CONTEXT Internationally, various warfarin education strategies have been described in the medical literature and delivered by a variety of health-care providers. However, none of these were tested in a Saudi setting.The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pharmacist interventions via an educational video on improving patient knowledge of and satisfaction with warfarin therapy and the international normalized ratio (INR). AIM The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pharmacist interventions via an educational video on improving patient knowledge of and satisfaction with warfarin therapy and the international normalized ratio (INR).This study adopted a prospective pre- and posttest design and enrolled 91 patients from an anticoagulant clinic at King Khaled University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between September 2017 and February 2018. SETTING AND DESIGN This study adopted a prospective pre- and posttest design and enrolled 91 patients from an anticoagulant clinic at King Khaled University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between September 2017 and February 2018.All patients completed the Anticoagulation Knowledge Assessment (AKA) and Anti-Clot Treatment Satisfaction (ACTS) scales. Subsequently, the patients watched a 10-min educational video containing basic information regarding warfarin and were given relevant informative booklets. The patients were reassessed after a mean follow-up period of approximately 52 days. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients completed the Anticoagulation Knowledge Assessment (AKA) and Anti-Clot Treatment Satisfaction (ACTS) scales. Subsequently, the patients watched a 10-min educational video containing basic information regarding warfarin and were given relevant informative booklets. The patients were reassessed after a mean follow-up period of approximately 52 days.In total, 85 patients completed the study. The impact of the intervention on patient knowledge was highly significant (mean difference = 17.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 21.75-13.58, P < 0.000). In addition, the patients showed significant increases in their ACTS benefits subscale scores (mean difference = 0.73, 95% CI = 1.22-0.24, P = 0.004). Despite being long-term warfarin users, the patients' INRs had a greater tendency to be within the target range after the intervention (56.63% ± 35% vs. 64.72% ± 35% of the time; mean difference, 8.1 percentage points; effect size = 0.23). However, there was no significant effect on patients' perceptions of the warfarin burden. RESULTS In total, 85 patients completed the study. The impact of the intervention on patient knowledge was highly significant (mean difference = 17.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 21.75-13.58, P < 0.000). In addition, the patients showed significant increases in their ACTS benefits subscale scores (mean difference = 0.73, 95% CI = 1.22-0.24, P = 0.004). Despite being long-term warfarin users, the patients' INRs had a greater tendency to be within the target range after the intervention (56.63% ± 35% vs. 64.72% ± 35% of the time; mean difference, 8.1 percentage points; effect size = 0.23). However, there was no significant effect on patients' perceptions of the warfarin burden.This study provided evidence that a pharmacist-led audiovisual intervention via an educational video coupled with an informational booklet effectively improved patients' knowledge retention and satisfaction with warfarin therapy benefits. Longer studies are needed to determine the impact of this intervention on patients' perceptions of warfarin burdens and their INRs. CONCLUSION This study provided evidence that a pharmacist-led audiovisual intervention via an educational video coupled with an informational booklet effectively improved patients' knowledge retention and satisfaction with warfarin therapy benefits. Longer studies are needed to determine the impact of this intervention on patients' perceptions of warfarin burdens and their INRs.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptual framework on knowledge loss in a manufacturing sector based on three aspects: likelihood of knowledge loss, critical areas of knowledge loss and relevance of each of these knowledge areas in terms of utilization and alignment with organizational goals and strategy. Such a conceptual framework can be helpful to the practicing managers in understanding the types of knowledge that is lost of a given departing employee and thus deciding on a measure to retain the critical employees or capture their knowledge before they leave. Design/methodology/approach Using a case study approach, data has been collected from a multinational battery manufacturing company based in Hong Kong. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted and analyzed through CAQDAS ATLAS.ti to generate the themes which were then used to develop the conceptual framework. Findings The findings revealed that the likelihood factors of knowledge loss in the manufacturing sector include layoffs, retirement, immigration and job change. The critical areas of knowledge loss comprise the knowledge of relationships and networks, especially with the customers and suppliers, the technical knowledge (battery and process technology) and knowledge of management, among others. The relevance of each of these knowledge areas needs to be determined through proper analysis whether these knowledge areas are needed in future projects, up to date and aligned with organizational goals and strategy along with other factors. Research limitations/implications Using the developed conceptual framework, managers and executives can identify critical employees in the manufacturing sector and accordingly take some appropriate measures to retain their knowledge. Caution should be taken while applying the findings of this study in other industries and context. Originality/value This paper is an attempt to reduce the dearth of empirical studies by exploring knowledge retention in the manufacturing sector, especially in the development of proper conceptual frameworks to assess the potential knowledge loss of employees.

Abstract: Despite extensive research, measurable benefits of predictive policing are scarce. We argue that powerful models might not always help the work of officers. Furthermore, developed models are often unexplainable, leading to trust issues between police intuition and machine-made prediction. We use a joint approach, mixing criminology and data science knowledge, to design an explainable predictive policing model. The proposed model (a set of explainable decision trees) can predict police resource requirement across the city and explain this prediction based on human-understandable cues (i.e., past event information, weather, and socio-demographic information). The explainable decision tree is then compared to a non-explainable model (i.e., a neural network) to compare performance. Analyzing the decision tree behaviour revealed multiple relations with established criminology knowledge. Weather and recent event distribution were found to be the most useful predictors of police workforce resource. Despite wide research showing relationships between socio-demographic information and police activity, socio-demographic information did not contribute much to the model’s performance. Though there is a lack of research on measurable effects of predictive policing applications, we argue that combining human instinct with machine prediction reduces risks of human knowledge loss, machine bias, and lack of confidence in the system. Alternate abstract: Malgré la recherche extensive, les bénéfices mesurables du maintien de l’ordre prédictif sont rares. Nous soutenons que les modèles puissants n’aident pas toujours le travail des agents de police. De plus, les modèles développés sont souvent inexplicables, entraînant des problèmes de confiance entre l’intuition policière et les prédictions faites par des machines. Nous utilisons une approche double, mélangeant la criminologie et les connaissances de la science des données, pour concevoir un modèle du maintien de l’ordre prédictif explicable. Le modèle proposé (un groupe d’arbres de décisions explicables) peut prévoir les ressources policières requises partout dans la ville et expliquer cette prédiction selon des facteurs compréhensibles par les humains (p. ex. : des renseignements sur des événements antérieurs, la météo, des renseignements sociodémographiques). L’arbre de décisions explicables est ensuite comparé à un modèle non explicable (c.-à-d. un réseau neuronal) pour comparer les performances. L’analyse du comportement de l’arbre de décision dévoile de multiples relations avec une connaissance établie en criminologie. La météo et la distribution d’événements récents se sont dévoilés comme étant les prédicteurs les plus utiles pour les ressources policières. Malgré de vastes recherches montrant les relations entre les renseignements sociodémographiques et les activités policières, ces renseignements n’ont pas vraiment contribué à la performance du modèle. Bien qu’il y ait un manque de recherche sur les effets mesurables de l’application du maintien de l’ordre prédictif, nous soutenons qu’une combinaison de l’instinct humain et de la prédiction machine réduit le risque de perte de connaissances humaines, de préjugés contre les machines et de perdre confiance dans le système.

Abstract: As a matter of fact that one of the COVID-19 consequences is the significant implementation of eLearning methods within universities across the world. As most students used to physically attend the traditional classrooms, nowadays they are obliged to continue their studies through virtual sessions. Academics should conveniently use the available technology tools in order to ease the delivery of information to their students so the quality of teaching will not considerably differ. Even though eLearning has many merits, it also confronts some obstacles. Academics concern about the students' retention of knowledge through this pandemic and seek for better online teaching approaches for the reason that students can maintain the information for a longer time. This paper explains the concept of eLearning in higher education in particular and what is the recent status of eLearning in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Moreover, it focuses on the knowledge retention notion and why it matters for students in higher education. Furthermore, it provides some useful recommendations for academics to enhance the knowledge retention of their distance students and minimize any occurred problems. As a result, this will ultimately create eLearning champions.

Embodied interaction: Learning Chinese characters through body movements

Abstract: This experimental study examined the design and effectiveness of embodied interactions for learning. The researchers designed a digital learning environment integrating body joint mapping sensors to teach novice learners Chinese characters, and examined whether the embodied interaction would lead to greater knowledge acquisition in language learning compared to the conventional mouse -based interaction. Fifty-three adult learners were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The study adopted a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a delayed posttest on knowledge acquisition. Although higher scores were found for the embodied interaction group in both posttests, only the delayed posttest showed a statistically significant group difference. The findings suggested that active embodied actions lead to better knowledge retention compared with the passive visual embodiment. The body-moving process works as an alternative and complementary encoding strategy for character understanding and memorization by associating the semantic meaning of a character with the construction of a body posture.

Abstract: In multi-source data analysis, the absence of data values or attributes is inevitably brought about by various influencing factors including environment, which results in the loss of knowledge to be conveyed by data. To solve the problem of missing data in multi-source data analysis, completion method for multiview missing data based on multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization was proposed in this paper. This method was based on the assumption of consistency of the multiview data and an algorithm of multi-manifold regularized non-negative matrix factorization is adopted to obtain homogeneous manifold and global clustering. On this basis, a multiview synergistic discrimination model is built of the non-missing view that referred to the Gaussian mixture model to pre-mark the clustering that the incremental missing data belonged to. Using the consistency of each view in the low-dimensional space, a prediction model of missing data at the specified view is established using the multiple linear regression technique to achieve accurate data completion under conditions of missing multi-attributes. Through the establishment of data filling model with three handling methods for missing values, namely CMMD-MNMF, FIMUS and Hot deck, the completion performance, clustering performance and classification performance of data sets including UCI, Flower17 and Flower102 are analyzed by simulation experiments. As shown in the results, the method of multi-view data missing completion is verified to be effective.

Abstract: The feedback given to students plays an important role in their efficiency related to learning practical skills. In the present study, diverse feedback modalities have been investigated. Our hypothesis is that individualized and unsupervised video feedback can produce a similar learning experience as performing practical skills in an oral and maxillofacial surgery setting with conventional direct expert feedback (control group). BACKGROUND The feedback given to students plays an important role in their efficiency related to learning practical skills. In the present study, diverse feedback modalities have been investigated. Our hypothesis is that individualized and unsupervised video feedback can produce a similar learning experience as performing practical skills in an oral and maxillofacial surgery setting with conventional direct expert feedback (control group).This prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded study compared direct expert feedback (DEF), individualized video feedback (IVF) and unsupervised video feedback (UVF). The participants were fourth-year dental students from University Goethe in Frankfurt. The students were assigned to one of the three feedback methods (n = 20 per group) using simple randomization. All participants watched an instruction video for an interdental ('Ernst') ligature and periphery venous catheterization. Next, the students were video recorded performing the tasks by themselves (pre-test). Following this, every student received feedback using one of the above-mentioned feedback modalities. The participants then performed the same task again while being video recorded (post-test) to measure the acquired competence. Six weeks later, the students participated in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to evaluate their long-term knowledge retention. All examiners were blinded regarding the students' instructional approach and their affiliation in terms of the learning group.

UVF had the strongest effect on performance time. The comparison between each group in the post-test showed no significant differences between the three groups.

UVF had the strongest effect on performance time. The comparison between each group in the post-test showed no significant differences between the three groups.This study showed that IVF and UVF can be considered an alternative or adjunct to conventional methods (i.e. DEF) when learning procedural skills in oral and maxillofacial surgery. However, DEF showed to be the most effective method of feedback and therefore preferable in teaching.

Abstract: Problem-solving and critical thinking are critical skills that engineers need to develop to be competitive and meet the requirements of the future job market. The use of Active Learning ( AL ) strategies allows instructors to develop these skills in the students while completing the academic program contents. The purpose of this study is to design and implement AL self-regulated activities developed in Virtual Learning environments and supported by computer simulations for the instruction of numerical methods. Through the use of a real-life engineering problem, in this case, the analysis of a vehicle suspension system, the simulation-based activity provided an environment for the students to analyze the effect of the parameters of numerical methods used to solve a set of Ordinary Differential Equations ( ODE ). Students compared the solution obtained with numerical methods of different order and different levels of accuracy, both qualitatively and quantitatively. A control group and an experimental group were used to compare and assess the impact of the proposed learning strategy on the instruction of numerical methods. Students who participated in these activities showed a more profound comprehension and obtained higher grades. Through the use of technological tools for guided activities, students acquired and practiced varied technical concepts, compared different solutions, and analyzed how numerical methods could be used to solve complex engineering problems. In addition, the students showed improved engagement, satisfaction, and knowledge retention. Although the main objective of the proposed activity is for the students to acquire a particular competency (i.e., solution of ODE ), the development of these kinds of activities (i.e., based on a technological platform) provides the additional advantage of training the students in a technical environment. This depends on the selection of the technological platform where the activity is designed; in this case, Matlab/Simulink , a software widely used in both industrial and academic settings, introduced the students to a real-world technological tool.

Abstract: Poor knowledge retention is a persistent problem among medical students. This challenging issue may be addressed by optimizing frequently used instructional designs, such as lectures. Guided by neuroscientific literature, we designed a spaced learning lecture in which the educator repeats the to-be-learned information using short temporal intervals. We investigated if this modified instructional design could enhance students' retention. INTRODUCTION Poor knowledge retention is a persistent problem among medical students. This challenging issue may be addressed by optimizing frequently used instructional designs, such as lectures. Guided by neuroscientific literature, we designed a spaced learning lecture in which the educator repeats the to-be-learned information using short temporal intervals. We investigated if this modified instructional design could enhance students' retention.Second-year medical students ( n = 148) were randomly allocated to either the spaced lecture or the traditional lecture. The spaced lecture consisted of three 15-min instructional periods, separated by 5-min intervals. A short summary of the preceding information was provided after each interval. The traditional lecture encompassed the same information including the summary in the massed format, thus without the intervals. All students performed a baseline knowledge test 2 weeks prior to the lectures and students' knowledge retention was assessed 8 days after the lectures.

The traditional lecture encompassed the same information including the summary in the massed format, thus without the intervals. All students performed a baseline knowledge test 2 weeks prior to the lectures and students' knowledge retention was assessed 8 days after the lectures.The average score on the retention test ( α = 0.74) was not significantly different between the spaced lecture group (33.8% ± 13.6%) and the traditional lecture group (31.8% ± 12.9%) after controlling for students' baseline-test performance ( F (1,104) = 0.566, p = 0.458). Students' narrative comments showed that the spaced lecture format was well-received and subjectively benefitted their attention-span and cognitive engagement.

Abstract: To improve knowledge, skills, and confidence in mass casualty management through design and im-plementation of a formal educational curriculum. OBJECTIVE To improve knowledge, skills, and confidence in mass casualty management through design and im-plementation of a formal educational curriculum.Observational study using a mixed-methods formal educational training curriculum. DESIGN Observational study using a mixed-methods formal educational training curriculum.Rural Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system in Pennsylvania. Subjects/participants: Convenience sample of 141 licensed EMS providers. SETTING Rural Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system in Pennsylvania. Subjects/participants: Convenience sample of 141 licensed EMS providers.Formal educational curriculum using a computerized mass casualty scenario, lectures, hands-on skill stations, post-intervention participant satisfaction survey, knowledge retention at three- and six-month post curriculum. INTERVENTIONS Formal educational curriculum using a computerized mass casualty scenario, lectures, hands-on skill stations, post-intervention participant satisfaction survey, knowledge retention at three- and six-month post curriculum.The formal curriculum resulted in an improvement in scene size-up, incident command system (ICS) set-up, and medical management of 12 percent, 27 percent, and 26 percent, respectively. Average scores on the written component evaluating mass casualty incident (MCI) management and knowledge of test patient triage were 84 percent and 74 percent, respectively. Knowledge recall at three- and six-month post-training was highly retained as test scores were generally unchanged from the time of the educational session. Course and instructor evaluations by participants reflected a high degree of satisfaction (scoring five on a five-point Likert scale). RESULTS The formal curriculum resulted in an improvement in scene size-up, incident command system (ICS) set-up, and medical management of 12 percent, 27 percent, and 26 percent, respectively. Average scores on the written component evaluating mass casualty incident (MCI) management and knowledge of test patient triage were 84 percent and 74 percent, respectively. Knowledge recall at three- and six-month post-training was highly retained as test scores were generally unchanged from the time of the educational session. Course and instructor evaluations by participants reflected a high degree of satisfaction (scoring five on a five-point Likert scale).The formal curriculum was effective in improving the knowledge, skills, and confidence of mass casualty management. Although traditional educational methods tend to show decreases in long-term knowledge retention, the mixed active learning strategies used in this curriculum resulted in high level retention since short and long-term test scores were similar and unchanged over time. Additionally, this curriculum was perceived by participants as highly satisfactory toward their knowledge and skill development. CONCLUSIONS The formal curriculum was effective in improving the knowledge, skills, and confidence of mass casualty management. Although traditional educational methods tend to show decreases in long-term knowledge retention, the mixed active learning strategies used in this curriculum resulted in high level retention since short and long-term test scores were similar and unchanged over time. Additionally, this curriculum was perceived by participants as highly satisfactory toward their knowledge and skill development.

Abstract: Road traffic collisions are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-resource countries. Compounding this issue is a lack of advanced medical training in these regions and a paucity of developed emergency medical services (EMS). To help address this need, a distance-based EMS educational module was developed with the goal of advancing medical training in resource-poor areas. INTRODUCTION Road traffic collisions are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-resource countries. Compounding this issue is a lack of advanced medical training in these regions and a paucity of developed emergency medical services (EMS). To help address this need, a distance-based EMS educational module was developed with the goal of advancing medical training in resource-poor areas.This prospective study evaluated the knowledge acquisition and technical effectiveness of a live online, distance-based EMS lecture provided to medical providers at Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital in Belize City, Belize. Participants were given a pretest consisting of 15 questions regarding ambulance and emergency vehicle safety, followed by a posttest of the same questions. One month later, a third test with the same questions was administered to assess knowledge retention. Technological effectiveness was evaluated as well. DESIGN This prospective study evaluated the knowledge acquisition and technical effectiveness of a live online, distance-based EMS lecture provided to medical providers at Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital in Belize City, Belize. Participants were given a pretest consisting of 15 questions regarding ambulance and emergency vehicle safety, followed by a posttest of the same questions. One month later, a third test with the same questions was administered to assess knowledge retention. Technological effectiveness was evaluated as well.Nine participants completed all aspects of the study. Improvement was noted between the average scores of the pretest compared to the posttest (32.5% vs 74.1%) and was maintained from the pretest through the delayed posttest (32.5% vs 57.0%). Overall, participants approved of the technical aspects of the project. RESULTS Nine participants completed all aspects of the study. Improvement was noted between the average scores of the pretest compared to the posttest (32.5% vs 74.1%) and was maintained from the pretest through the delayed posttest (32.5% vs 57.0%). Overall, participants approved of the technical aspects of the project.This synchronously presented distance-based EMS educational program showed gains in both immediate and delayed knowledge acquisition among a small sample size. These results show promise that online, distance-based education is a viable option for continuing graduate medical education in low-resource countries. CONCLUSIONS This synchronously presented distance-based EMS educational program showed gains in both immediate and delayed knowledge acquisition among a small sample size. These results show promise that online, distance-based education is a viable option for continuing graduate medical education in low-resource countries.

Abstract: urpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate nursing students' knowledge of the nurse's role in the interprofessional management of dysphagia. Design A quasi-experimental, pretest–posttest educational intervention was used in this study. Methods Thirty-eight pretest and 37 posttest undergraduate nursing students participated. An addendum to the original study assessed knowledge retention in a separate group of nursing students who had received a similar educational intervention 1.5 years prior. Findings Statistically significant changes were found between pretests and posttests. The knowledge retention group performed more poorly in some areas, suggesting that initial instruction was not reinforced beyond the novice level. Conclusions Educating nursing students about the nurse's role in the management of dysphagia will increase their knowledge, but this knowledge must be reinforced for integration into clinical practice. More research is needed to determine what education nursing students receive on dysphagia and what the role of the nurse is in the management of dysphagia. Clinical Relevance Dysphagia negatively impacts clinical and rehabilitation outcomes. Because nurses may lack sufficient training in the management of dysphagia, healthcare organizations should offer such training to new hires and then periodically thereafter. Likewise, practicing nurses who serve as preceptors should be prepared to train nursing students and new nurses how to safely manage dysphagia.

Abstract: A goal of any educational measure is to improve students' capability to retain teaching content. In this paper, we investigate the potential of gamification to foster knowledge retention using an action research approach. We present the results from a longitudinal study including 617 secondary and tertiary education students conducted over a period of two years. Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter. The steady increase in students' learning performance resulting from constant refinement of the workshops demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating gamification principles into educational activities.

Abstract: As instructors seek ways to increase student engagement and retention, several innovative pedagogical approaches have been developed that fosters critical thinking and quality group work. One of these approaches is Team-Based Learning (TBL), a flipped-classroom model that has been found to improve student outcomes and knowledge retention. While prior research has found students tend to have positive perceptions of TBL, these have been limited to other disciplines. The current study sought to examine how students perceive the use of TBL in two criminal justice courses through pre- and post-test surveys. Results indicated that students overall had positive perceptions of TBL as they found solving problems in teams to be effective and tended to prefer TBL to traditional lecture-based courses. Implications and future directions are also discussed.

Abstract: Introduction Integration has been recognized as an important aspect of medical education. After transitioning from a discipline‐specific to a systems‐based preclinical curriculum, we examined faculty perceptions of the integrated approach and also whether it would lead to better anatomy knowledge retention. Methods To understand faculty perspectives, we reviewed curricular materials, interviewed block directors, and observed educational sessions. We analyzed knowledge retention through a 27‐question anatomy test, comparing scores from the last class of the discipline‐based curriculum and the first two classes of the integrated curriculum. Results Planning integrated content involves purposeful ordering, is challenging for faculty, and requires additional resources. Evaluation of the integrated approach for anatomy content demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge retention ( p = .012; 56.28% vs. 63.98% for old vs. new curriculum). Conclusions This study helps the understanding of what is required for curricular integration. Our anatomy evaluation results corroborated the view that contextually embedded information is easier to learn and retain.

This study aims to provide a three-phase model to develop a web-based health information website that helps populations with limited English proficiency (LEP) increase health literacy and improve healthcare service access.Accessing and receiving quality healthcare in an unfamiliar health system is a significant challenge for many new immigrants and refugees. This study aims to provide a three-phase model to develop a web-based health information website that helps populations with limited English proficiency (LEP) increase health literacy and improve healthcare service access.First, we conducted a needs assessment from community leaders and service providers. Second, we developed contents from credible sources and tested each item using multiple readability tests. Last, we revised each item to lower the readability and retest its readability. METHOD First, we conducted a needs assessment from community leaders and service providers. Second, we developed contents from credible sources and tested each item using multiple readability tests. Last, we revised each item to lower the readability and retest its readability.The average reading level for the original 99 topics was assessed at 10.84 (SD= 3.26). After revisions, we were able to lower the readability to 8.56 (SD= 2.96), which was around two grade levels lower, on average. RESULTS The average reading level for the original 99 topics was assessed at 10.84 (SD= 3.26). After revisions, we were able to lower the readability to 8.56 (SD= 2.96), which was around two grade levels lower, on average.the main purpose for building an English based health information website was to assist the population with LEP. By using simple English with lower readability, it will ease the translation process. This study demonstrates a process to develop suitable contents for populations in need. In the future, incorporating visual aid and other multimedia will be beneficial in user engagement and knowledge retention. CONCLUSION the main purpose for building an English based health information website was to assist the population with LEP. By using simple English with lower readability, it will ease the translation process. This study demonstrates a process to develop suitable contents for populations in need. In the future, incorporating visual aid and other multimedia will be beneficial in user engagement and knowledge retention.

Abstract: A goal of any educational measure is to improve students' capability to retain teaching content. In this paper, we investigate the potential of gamification to foster knowledge retention using an action research approach. We present the results from a longitudinal study including 617 secondary and tertiary education students conducted over a period of two years. Various workshop designs that incorporated numerous gamification elements were compared with non-gamified workshop designs, tested and refined over time. The improved workshop designs led to increased levels of knowledge retention that exceeded the benchmark values from educational literature. We found that gamification exerts a positive impact on knowledge retention. We tested for the moderating effects of gender and age and found no effect of the former and inconsistent results for the latter. The steady increase in students’ learning performance resulting from constant refinement of the workshops demonstrates the usefulness of incorporating gamification principles into educational activities.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to support the management of organizational knowledge retention through a multi-criteria decision aiding–constructivist model. Design/methodology/approach This exploratory and descriptive case study presents a decision support model guided by the constructivist approach and proactive in its operationalization. Findings The objectives and concerns of decision-makers regarding the retention of organizational knowledge are identified and organized into six strategic areas of concern, namely, recognition, knowledge dissemination, organizational culture, succession of professionals, management of vulnerability origins and knowledge management; a multi-criteria model is constructed and operationalized by a cluster of cardinal scales, showing and measuring the status quo of the performance profile, both in a local and global way, to support the management of the organization's knowledge retention; activities are classified into three performance levels (compromising, competitive and excellent), supported by graphical and numerical evidence; and the process to generate actions to improve the performance of critical activities and create the conditions to maximize the results of the organization is illustrated. Practical implications Based on the model, decision-makers are now aware of the essential aspects to support knowledge retention management, enabling them to monitor the current situation and proactively respond to ensure that the current knowledge potential is maintained and exploited. Originality/value Use of a constructivist approach to support the management of knowledge retention, incorporating into the model the specifics of the context and the values of its managers, and thus giving it legitimacy.

Abstract: Integration has been recognized as an important aspect of medical education. After transitioning from a discipline-specific to a systems-based preclinical curriculum, we examined faculty perceptions of the integrated approach and also whether it would lead to better anatomy knowledge retention. INTRODUCTION Integration has been recognized as an important aspect of medical education. After transitioning from a discipline-specific to a systems-based preclinical curriculum, we examined faculty perceptions of the integrated approach and also whether it would lead to better anatomy knowledge retention.To understand faculty perspectives, we reviewed curricular materials, interviewed block directors, and observed educational sessions. We analyzed knowledge retention through a 27-question anatomy test, comparing scores from the last class of the discipline-based curriculum and the first two classes of the integrated curriculum. METHODS To understand faculty perspectives, we reviewed curricular materials, interviewed block directors, and observed educational sessions. We analyzed knowledge retention through a 27-question anatomy test, comparing scores from the last class of the discipline-based curriculum and the first two classes of the integrated curriculum.Planning integrated content involves purposeful ordering, is challenging for faculty, and requires additional resources. Evaluation of the integrated approach for anatomy content demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge retention (p = .012; 56.28% vs. 63.98% for old vs. new curriculum). RESULTS Planning integrated content involves purposeful ordering, is challenging for faculty, and requires additional resources. Evaluation of the integrated approach for anatomy content demonstrated a significant increase in knowledge retention (p = .012; 56.28% vs. 63.98% for old vs. new curriculum).This study helps the understanding of what is required for curricular integration. Our anatomy evaluation results corroborated the view that contextually embedded information is easier to learn and retain. CONCLUSIONS This study helps the understanding of what is required for curricular integration. Our anatomy evaluation results corroborated the view that contextually embedded information is easier to learn and retain.

Abstract: We determine whether interpolated questions in a podcast improve knowledge acquisition and retention. STUDY OBJECTIVE We determine whether interpolated questions in a podcast improve knowledge acquisition and retention.This double-blinded controlled trial randomized trainees from 6 emergency medicine programs to listen to 1 of 2 versions of a podcast, produced de novo on the history of hypertension. The versions were identical except that 1 included 5 interpolated questions to highlight educational points (intervention). There were 2 postpodcast assessments, 1 within 48 hours of listening (immediate posttest) and a second 2 to 3 weeks later (retention test), consisting of the same 15 multiple-choice questions, 5 directly related to the interpolated questions and 10 unrelated. The primary outcome was the difference in intergroup mean assessment scores at each point. A sample size was calculated a priori to identify a significant interarm difference. METHODS This double-blinded controlled trial randomized trainees from 6 emergency medicine programs to listen to 1 of 2 versions of a podcast, produced de novo on the history of hypertension. The versions were identical except that 1 included 5 interpolated questions to highlight educational points (intervention). There were 2 postpodcast assessments, 1 within 48 hours of listening (immediate posttest) and a second 2 to 3 weeks later (retention test), consisting of the same 15 multiple-choice questions, 5 directly related to the interpolated questions and 10 unrelated. The primary outcome was the difference in intergroup mean assessment scores at each point. A sample size was calculated a priori to identify a significant interarm difference.One hundred thirty-seven emergency medicine trainees were randomized to listen to a podcast, 69 without interpolated questions (control) and 68 with them (intervention). Although no significant difference was detected at the immediate posttest, trainees randomized to the interpolated arm had a significantly higher mean score on the retention test, with a 5.6% absolute difference (95% confidence interval 0.2% to 10.9%). For the material covered by the interpolated questions, the intervention arm had significantly higher mean scores on both the immediate posttest and retention tests, with absolute differences of 8.7% (95% confidence interval 1.6% to 15.8%) and 10.1% (95% confidence interval 2.8% to 17.4%), respectively. There was no significant intergroup difference for noninterpolated questions. RESULTS One hundred thirty-seven emergency medicine trainees were randomized to listen to a podcast, 69 without interpolated questions (control) and 68 with them (intervention). Although no significant difference was detected at the immediate posttest, trainees randomized to the interpolated arm had a significantly higher mean score on the retention test, with a 5.6% absolute difference (95% confidence interval 0.2% to 10.9%).

There was no significant intergroup difference for noninterpolated questions.Podcasts containing interpolated questions improved knowledge retention at 2 to 3 weeks, driven by the retention of material covered by the interpolated questions. Although the gains may be modest, educational podcasters may improve knowledge retention by using interpolating questions. CONCLUSION Podcasts containing interpolated questions improved knowledge retention at 2 to 3 weeks, driven by the retention of material covered by the interpolated questions. Although the gains may be modest, educational podcasters may improve knowledge retention by using interpolating questions.

Abstract: The Stop the Bleed (STB) Campaign supported by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACSCT) and numerous other national organizations aspires to translate lifesaving military successes into reductions in civilian hemorrhagic deaths. While a curricular framework has been described, precise approaches to hands-on training are not specified and training success rates are not yet optimized. Our aim was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an STB program enhanced by stepwise mastery learning with deliberate practice.

RESULTS 100% of participants reached mastery level for all 4 hemorrhage control skills within 4 tries.

Adopting these techniques in current STB programs could close the current trainee performance gap and substantially increase the annual number of successfully trained laypersons over current reported levels with no increase required in enrollees, programs, or resources. Future studies should address the challenges of knowledge retention and skill decay, just-in-time innovations, implementation science methods to broaden access, and barriers to responding to real-life crisis events. Surgery education leaders can close performance gaps and make a unique contribution to the Hartford Consensus principle: No one should die from uncontrolled bleeding.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate nursing students' knowledge of the nurse's role in the interprofessional management of dysphagia. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate nursing students' knowledge of the nurse's role in the interprofessional management of dysphagia.A quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest educational intervention was used in this study. DESIGN A quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest educational intervention was used in this study.Thirty-eight pretest and 37 posttest undergraduate nursing students participated. An addendum to the original study assessed knowledge retention in a separate group of nursing students who had received a similar educational intervention 1.5 years prior. METHODS Thirty-eight pretest and 37 posttest undergraduate nursing students participated. An addendum to the original study assessed knowledge retention in a separate group of nursing students who had received a similar educational intervention 1.5 years prior.Statistically significant changes were found between pretests and posttests. The knowledge retention group performed more poorly in some areas, suggesting that initial instruction was not reinforced beyond the novice level. FINDINGS Statistically significant changes were found between pretests and posttests. The knowledge retention group performed more poorly in some areas, suggesting that initial instruction was not reinforced beyond the novice level.Educating nursing students about the nurse's role in the management of dysphagia will increase their knowledge, but this knowledge must be reinforced for integration into clinical practice. More research is needed to determine what education nursing students receive on dysphagia and what the role of the nurse is in the management of dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS Educating nursing students about the nurse's role in the management of dysphagia will increase their knowledge, but this knowledge must be reinforced for integration into clinical practice. More research is needed to determine what education nursing students receive on dysphagia and what the role of the nurse is in the management of dysphagia.Dysphagia negatively impacts clinical and rehabilitation outcomes. Because nurses may lack sufficient training in the management of dysphagia, healthcare organizations should offer such training to new hires and then periodically thereafter. Likewise, practicing nurses who serve as preceptors should be prepared to train nursing students and new nurses how to safely manage dysphagia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dysphagia negatively impacts clinical and rehabilitation outcomes. Because nurses may lack sufficient training in the management of dysphagia, healthcare organizations should offer such training to new hires and then periodically thereafter. Likewise, practicing nurses who serve as preceptors should be prepared to train nursing students and new nurses how to safely manage dysphagia.

Abstract: While type 1 diabetes is frequently encountered clinically in pediatric endocrinology fellowship training, other types of diabetes may only be encountered in educational settings. Adult learners learn best through knowledge application, but to date there are no published curricula utilizing application educational strategies for all forms of diabetes. Introduction While type 1 diabetes is frequently encountered clinically in pediatric endocrinology fellowship training, other types of diabetes may only be encountered in educational settings. Adult learners learn best through knowledge application, but to date there are no published curricula utilizing application educational strategies for all forms of diabetes.We utilized a team-based learning (TBL) approach to create four modules on different types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and maturity-onset diabetes of the young. We divided our fellows (all training years, n = 11) into two teams and delivered four separate, 90-minute sessions. To emphasize the application of knowledge, we modified the format to combine the readiness assurance test (RAT) with application problem (APP) questions. The combined RAT/APP questions were answered by individuals and teams. We analyzed scores from individual and team tests and evaluated each module. Additionally, we acquired subjective data from the fellows regarding their experiences.

All the fellows agreed that the sessions should be included permanently. Additionally, all agreed the sessions helped them apply knowledge. Subjectively, the fellows were very engaged and lively during the sessions and felt the sessions were feasible as implemented.

Abstract: Symptom assessment is difficult to understand and be retained by second-year bachelor's nursing students. A flipped classroom combined with scenario simulation (FCSS) is a new potential teaching model. This study compares the teaching effect and knowledge retention between the FCSS approach and the traditional flipped classroom (FC) approach. BACKGROUND Symptom assessment is difficult to understand and be retained by second-year bachelor's nursing students. A flipped classroom combined with scenario simulation (FCSS) is a new potential teaching model. This study compares the teaching effect and knowledge retention between the FCSS approach and the traditional flipped classroom (FC) approach.Second-year bachelor's nursing students were selected as research participants. One group (n = 59) adopted an FCSS approach, whereas the other group (n = 68) adopted an FC approach. We evaluated student mastery and retention of knowledge through two tests: one before the next class, the other after 2 months. METHOD Second-year bachelor's nursing students were selected as research participants. One group (n = 59) adopted an FCSS approach, whereas the other group (n = 68) adopted an FC approach. We evaluated student mastery and retention of knowledge through two tests: one before the next class, the other after 2 months.Regarding knowledge mastery, the FC group had a higher score than the FCSS group both in total score (66.29 ± 15.27 versus 59.42 ± 10.76) and group learning score (46.06 ± 13.25 versus 38.47 ± 8.22) in the first test (p < .05). The retention of knowledge in the FCSS group was better than that in the FC group (p < .001), represented by the variable of test score difference before and after 2 months. RESULTS Regarding knowledge mastery, the FC group had a higher score than the FCSS group both in total score (66.29 ± 15.27 versus 59.42 ± 10.76) and group learning score (46.06 ± 13.25 versus 38.47 ± 8.22) in the first test (p < .05). The retention of knowledge in the FCSS group was better than that in the FC group (p < .001), represented by the variable of test score difference before and after 2 months.When teaching symptomatology, FCSS is helpful to enhance self-learning and improve student long-term memory.

Abstract: Background: Symptom assessment is difficult to understand and be retained by second-year bachelor's nursing students. A flipped classroom combined with scenario simulation (FCSS) is a new potential teaching model. This study compares the teaching effect and knowledge retention between the FCSS approach and the traditional flipped classroom (FC) approach. Method: Second-year bachelor's nursing students were selected as research participants. One group ( n = 59) adopted an FCSS approach, whereas the other group ( n = 68) adopted an FC approach. We evaluated student mastery and retention of knowledge through two tests: one before the next class, the other after 2 months. Results: Regarding knowledge mastery, the FC group had a higher score than the FCSS group both in total score (66.29 ± 15.27 versus 59.42 ± 10.76) and group learning score (46.06 ± 13.25 versus 38.47 ± 8.22) in the first test ( p < .05). The retention of knowledge in the FCSS group was better than that in the FC group ( p < .001), represented by the variable of test score difference before and after 2 months. Conclusion: When teaching symptomatology, FCSS is helpful to enhance self-learning and improve student long-term memory. [ J Nurs Educ . 2020;59(8):448–452.]

Abstract: Aim We sought to improve retention of neonatal resuscitation skills by modifying step 3 through additional functional verbalisation in Peyton's four‐step approach (P4S). Methods Newborn life support (NLS) training was performed in a simulation‐based setting. In contrast to the traditional approach, students taught with the modified approach were requested to explain every step of their performance in Peyton's step 3. A total of 123 students were allocated into both experimental groups. Students were then assessed by megacode on day four (initial assessment) and 6 months (follow‐up assessment). Results Both groups showed similar scorings in the initial, follow‐up assessment and in mean change. On initial megacode, time to start with initial inflation and post‐resuscitation care was significantly faster in the control group. All showed a significant loss of performance irrespective of modification in step 3 in the follow‐up assessment. Only time until start with post‐resuscitation care shows a significant group difference in mean change between initial and follow‐up with increasing time in the control and decreasing time span in intervention group. Conclusion Both methods showed equal levels of knowledge acquisition and long‐term decline in NLS performances. Verbalisation in step 3 influenced speed of applied NLS performance.

Abstract: The aim of this review is to explore the impact of educational interventions on clinicians' knowledge of radiation protection. OBJECTIVES The aim of this review is to explore the impact of educational interventions on clinicians' knowledge of radiation protection.Following a comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2000 to 2018, 1795 studies were identified, eight of which met the criteria for this review. All eight studies utilised pretest-posttest designs and involved the education of medical students or doctors. All studies reported an increase in participants' knowledge of radiation protection, five of which were statistically significant. In two studies, over half of participants stated that education received would impact on their future imaging requesting practice. KEY FINDINGS Following a comprehensive search of MEDLINE and EMBASE from 2000 to 2018, 1795 studies were identified, eight of which met the criteria for this review. All eight studies utilised pretest-posttest designs and involved the education of medical students or doctors. All studies reported an increase in participants' knowledge of radiation protection, five of which were statistically significant. In two studies, over half of participants stated that education received would impact on their future imaging requesting practice.Whilst a range of educational interventions have been shown to improve knowledge of radiation protection, there was wide variation in the study settings and type of educational programmes delivered. No studies assessed long-term knowledge retention or the impact on clinical practice. Therefore, robust research is needed to accurately measure the impact of educational programmes on knowledge of radiation protection in the UK and the implications this may have on referral practices. CONCLUSION Whilst a range of educational interventions have been shown to improve knowledge of radiation protection, there was wide variation in the study settings and type of educational programmes delivered. No studies assessed long-term knowledge retention or the impact on clinical practice. Therefore, robust research is needed to accurately measure the impact of educational programmes on knowledge of radiation protection in the UK and the implications this may have on referral practices.This review revealed that educational interventions are effective in increasing participants' knowledge levels of radiation protection. It is necessary to assess and ensure that this improvement in knowledge actually translates into an impact on referral practice/behaviour. The ideal outcome being that fewer unnecessary examinations are requested and our patients are protected from a needless increased radiation burden. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This review revealed that educational interventions are effective in increasing participants' knowledge levels of radiation protection. It is necessary to assess and ensure that this improvement in knowledge actually translates into an impact on referral practice/behaviour.

Abstract: This study examines the long‐term retention of anatomical knowledge from 180 students after various repetition activities. The retention of anatomical knowledge was assessed by multiple‐choice tests at five different points in time: before and after a course in Functional Anatomy, before and after repetition activities that occurred 14 weeks after this course, and 28 weeks after this course to establish long‐term retention. Students were divided into five groups: one without any repetition activity, one with a restricted repetition activity (the multiple‐choice test), and three groups that were offered repetition activities (traditional lecture, e‐learning module, and small group work in the dissection room). During all three repetition activities the same information was conveyed, and this content was not revisited in other courses for the duration of the study. The results showed that students who did not engage in a repetition activity scored significantly lower on the long‐term retention test compared to all other groups (ANCOVA: P = 0.0001). Pair‐wise comparison with estimated means showed that the other four groups, regardless of the type of repeating activity, did not differ in the amount of knowledge they retained during any of the five assessments ( P = 0.008, P = 0.0001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.0001, respectively). This study suggests that the type of repetition activity has no effect on knowledge retention both immediately following the activity and in the long term. It is concluded that the repetition of anatomical knowledge in any form is beneficial for students and will likely improve student outcomes in a curriculum that builds on prior knowledge.

Abstract: Introduction: A blended learning continuing education course may appeal to busy healthcare professionals because the primary content can be learned online while an in-person component can hone clinical skills. The current study assessed knowledge retention in a sample of healthcare professionals who participated in a nationwide sexual assault forensic examiner blended learning course (12-week online course and 2-day in-person patient simulation). Methods: Participants' characteristics, motivation, and external barriers were collected through a precourse web-based survey. Participants' knowledge was assessed through pretests and posttests for 12 modules and a 3-month postcourse examination. Utilizing repeated measures analysis of variance, the study examined whether participants retained their knowledge at the 3-month follow-up point. Multiple linear regression was utilized to explore the factors associated with knowledge retention. Results: The results found a knowledge score from 77.92% to 68.83% correct. The findings indicate that participants who were interested in the blended learning course because of the 2-day patient simulation were more likely to retain knowledge. Learners with more years of experience also had slightly higher knowledge retention. Conversely, participants who were interested in becoming a sexual assault forensic examiner because of a sexual assault experience had lower knowledge retention. Participation in a past online course also was associated with a reduction in knowledge retention. Discussion: The findings indicate a modest knowledge loss 3 months after the blended learning course. Still, some participants experienced less knowledge retention than others. Postcourse activities such as a brief refresher course may be useful to help these participants maintain their knowledge gains.

Abstract: Context: Conventional medical curricula have created an impenetrable wall between the preclinical and clinical years of training, thus submerging relevance of basic sciences in clinical setup. Recently, the Medical Council of India has introduced a number of changes and updates in the medical education, including “early clinical exposure” (ECE) in newly proposed competency-based medical education. ECE does not replace the basic and clinical sciences but enriches and contextualizes that learning, therefore motivating the students to develop a better insight into medical profession. Aims: (1) To develop a protocol for the introduction of ECE in undergraduate medical training, (2) to validate and to deliver it to the 1 st year MBBS students and assess their perceptions. Settings and Design: It was a prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. Subjects and Methods: After taking permission from the institutional research committee and institutional ethical committee, a protocol for the introduction of ECE in Biochemistry was developed. The feedback questionnaire for the students and the faculty and retro-preself-efficacy questionnaire for the students were designed and validated. The ECE protocol was delivered to 143 1 st -year MBBS students, and perceptions of concerned were collected and analyzed. Statistical Analysis Used: Collected data were analyzed in terms of percentages, medians, and satisfaction index and were represented in graphs. Results: Students reported that the ECE session was an enjoyable, satisfactory, and effective learning tool, with the improvement in knowledge, retention, attention, and motivation. Students also reported that this method of teaching–learning should be implemented in other topics as well as in other subjects of the first professional course. Conclusions: ECE protocol was perceived as very satisfactory by the students, and it helped in improvement of knowledge and to understand the relevance of preclinical subject in clinical setup.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Dietetics students receive DASH-diet education as part of their medical nutrition therapy (MNT) curriculum. The ability for students to translate that knowledge into practice is currently unknown. There is evidence supporting that culinary nutrition education integrated into coursework has shown a positive association with nutrition knowledge and self-efficacy in students, adults, and health professionals. However, there is limited research showing the impact of culinary nutrition education on dietetics students. To determine the impact of a combined lecture and DASH-diet culinary module for undergraduate dietetics students on knowledge and self-efficacy in making culinary-related recipe adaptations. This is a quasi-experimental pre-, post-study design. Using a non-probability and purposive sampling technique, students were recruited from a MNT class at San José State University (SJSU) and were randomly assigned to control (n = 12) and intervention (n = 13) group. All students received a DASH-diet lecture while only the intervention group received a culinary module following the lecture. Data collection involved a questionnaire administered pre- and post-intervention and during a 1-month follow-up. Data analysis included descriptive statistics reported as means compared between and within groups using SPSS version 25. There was a statistically significant improvement in identifying maximum amount of sodium in post (P = .009) and ingredient substitutions in pre (P = .12) and post (P = .008) between control and intervention group. There was a statistically significant improvement in identifying sodium-containing ingredients (P = .046) and ingredient substitution (P < .00) within the intervention group. This pilot study shows culinary nutrition education has the potential to positively impact dietetics students’ knowledge on the DASH diet. Future programs should incorporate longer modules with additional opportunities to engage in hands-on practice and promote knowledge retention.

Abstract: ENG English ENG The remarkable biodiversity of the Brazilian Amazon is poorly documented and threatened by deforestation. When undocumented areas become deforested, in addition to losing the fauna and flora, we lose the opportunity to know which unique species had occupied a habitat. Here we quantify such knowledge loss by calculating how much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested and will likely be deforested until 2050 without having its tree flora sufficiently documented. To this end, we analysed 399 147 digital specimens of nearly 6000 tree species in relation to official deforestation statistics and future deforestation scenarios. We find that by 2017, 30% of all the localities where tree specimens had been collected were mostly deforested. Some 300 000 km² (12%; 485 25 × 25 km grid cells) of the Brazilian Amazon had been deforested by 2017, without having a single tree specimen recorded. An additional 250 000–900 000 km² of severely under‐collected rainforest will likely become deforested by 2050. If future tree sampling is to cover this area, sampling effort has to increase two‐ to six‐fold. Nearly 255 000 km² or 7% of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon is easily accessible but does yet but remain under‐collected. Our study highlights how progressing deforestation increases the risk of losing undocumented species of a hyper‐diverse tree flora.

Abstract: Conventional medical curricula have created an impenetrable wall between the preclinical and clinical years of training, thus submerging relevance of basic sciences in clinical setup. Recently, the Medical Council of India has introduced a number of changes and updates in the medical education, including "early clinical exposure" (ECE) in newly proposed competency-based medical education. ECE does not replace the basic and clinical sciences but enriches and contextualizes that learning, therefore motivating the students to develop a better insight into medical profession. CONTEXT Conventional medical curricula have created an impenetrable wall between the preclinical and clinical years of training, thus submerging relevance of basic sciences in clinical setup. Recently, the Medical Council of India has introduced a number of changes and updates in the medical education, including "early clinical exposure" (ECE) in newly proposed competency-based medical education. ECE does not replace the basic and clinical sciences but enriches and contextualizes that learning, therefore motivating the students to develop a better insight into medical profession.(1) To develop a protocol for the introduction of ECE in undergraduate medical training, (2) to validate and to deliver it to the 1 st year MBBS students and assess their perceptions. AIMS (1) To develop a protocol for the introduction of ECE in undergraduate medical training, (2) to validate and to deliver it to the 1st year MBBS students and assess their perceptions.It was a prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study. SETTINGS AND DESIGN It was a prospective, nonrandomized, interventional study.After taking permission from the institutional research committee and institutional ethical committee, a protocol for the introduction of ECE in Biochemistry was developed. The feedback questionnaire for the students and the faculty and retro-preself-efficacy questionnaire for the students were designed and validated. The ECE protocol was delivered to 143 1 st -year MBBS students, and perceptions of concerned were collected and analyzed. SUBJECTS AND METHODS After taking permission from the institutional research committee and institutional ethical committee, a protocol for the introduction of ECE in Biochemistry was developed. The feedback questionnaire for the students and the faculty and retro-preself-efficacy questionnaire for the students were designed and validated. The ECE protocol was delivered to 143 1st-year MBBS students, and perceptions of concerned were collected and analyzed.Collected data were analyzed in terms of percentages, medians, and satisfaction index and were represented in graphs. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED Collected data were analyzed in terms of percentages, medians, and satisfaction index and were represented in graphs.Students reported that the ECE session was an enjoyable, satisfactory, and effective learning tool, with the improvement in knowledge, retention, attention, and motivation. Students also reported that this method of teaching-learning should be implemented in other topics as well as in other subjects of the first professional course. RESULTS Students reported that the ECE session was an enjoyable, satisfactory, and effective learning tool, with the improvement in knowledge, retention, attention, and motivation. Students also reported that this method of teaching-learning should be implemented in other topics as well as in other subjects of the first professional course.ECE protocol was perceived as very satisfactory by the students, and it helped in improvement of knowledge and to understand the relevance of preclinical subject in clinical setup. CONCLUSIONS ECE protocol was perceived as very satisfactory by the students, and it helped in improvement of knowledge and to understand the relevance of preclinical subject in clinical setup.

Abstract: Introduction A blended learning continuing education course may appeal to busy healthcare professionals because the primary content can be learned online while an in-person component can hone clinical skills. The current study assessed knowledge retention in a sample of healthcare professionals who participated in a nationwide sexual assault forensic examiner blended learning course (12-week online course and 2-day in-person patient simulation). Methods Participants' characteristics, motivation, and external barriers were collected through a precourse web-based survey. Participants' knowledge was assessed through pretests and posttests for 12 modules and a 3-month postcourse examination. Utilizing repeated measures analysis of variance, the study examined whether participants retained their knowledge at the 3-month follow-up point. Multiple linear regression was utilized to explore the factors associated with knowledge retention. Results The results found a knowledge score from 77.92% to 68.83% correct. The findings indicate that participants who were interested in the blended learning course because of the 2-day patient simulation were more likely to retain knowledge. Learners with more years of experience also had slightly higher knowledge retention. Conversely, participants who were interested in becoming a sexual assault forensic examiner because of a sexual assault experience had lower knowledge retention. Participation in a past online course also was associated with a reduction in knowledge retention. Discussion The findings indicate a modest knowledge loss 3 months after the blended learning course. Still, some participants experienced less knowledge retention than others. Postcourse activities such as a brief refresher course may be useful to help these participants maintain their knowledge gains.

Abstract: Correspondence to Dr Nadav Levy, Anesthesia, Critical Care and Pain Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA; nadav42@gmail.com Introduction High-tech dedicated simulation centres enable learning, knowledge retention and teamwork.1 2 However, simulation in real-life conditions (in situ) allows teams to practise in their familiar environment and avoids travel costs to a simulation centre.3 4 This practice report describes our In situ Multidisciplinary Simulation (IMS) project established in a large quaternary hospital. Together with the OR anaesthesist scheduler we identified potential OR and post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) low turnover times in order not to compromise OR workflow to perform IMS, and simulations were performed during participants’ work hours. System weaknesses identified during IMS We identified issues in our workflow during emergency situation: staff availability and defining roles during PACU emergencies; drugs labelled under generic names yet requested with brand names; the overhead code call was not location specific, due to identical OR and PACU slot numbering; nurses and OR ancillary staff were unaware of the availability and location of intravenous fat emulsion; under pressure of an emergency situation, our BLS/ACLS certified team members demonstrated difficulties operating the defibrillator.

Abstract: Securing the adoption of scalable agro-educational information and communication technology (ICT) solutions by farmers remains one of the international development community’s most elusive goals – in part due to two key gaps in the data: (1) limited comparisons of competing knowledge-delivery methods, and (2) few to no follow-ups on long-term knowledge retention and solution adoption. Addressing both of these gaps, this follow-up study measures farmer knowledge retention and solution adoption two years after being trained on an improved postharvest bean storage method in northern Mozambique. The results found animated-video knowledge delivery at least as effective as a traditional extension approach for knowledge retention (97.9%) and solution adoption (89%). As animated video can more cost-effectively reach the widest – even geographically isolated – populations, it readily complements extension services and international development community efforts to secure knowledge transfer and recipient buy-in for innovations. Implications and future research for adult learning are also discussed.

Abstract: The remarkable biodiversity of the Brazilian Amazon is poorly documented and threatened by deforestation. When undocumented areas become deforested, in addition to losing the fauna and flora, we lose the opportunity to know which unique species had occupied a habitat. Here we quantify such knowledge loss by calculating how much of the Brazilian Amazon has been deforested and will likely be deforested until 2050 without having its tree flora sufficiently documented. To this end, we analysed 399 147 digital specimens of nearly 6000 tree species in relation to official deforestation statistics and future deforestation scenarios. We find that by 2017, 30% of all the localities where tree specimens had been collected were mostly deforested. Some 300 000 km 2 (12%; 485 25 × 25 km grid cells) of the Brazilian Amazon had been deforested by 2017, without having a single tree specimen recorded. An additional 250 000–900 000 km 2 of severely under‐collected rainforest will likely become deforested by 2050. If future tree sampling is to cover this area, sampling effort has to increase two‐ to six‐fold. Nearly 255 000 km 2 or 7% of rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon is easily accessible but does yet but remain under‐collected. Our study highlights how progressing deforestation increases the risk of losing undocumented species of a hyper‐diverse tree flora.

Abstract: Objective Content and training about pediatric environmental health are lacking in healthcare professionals’ education. In an initiative to improve pediatric environmental health education, the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) program offers free, interactive, web-based (“eLearning”) modules on environmental health topics. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PEHSU eLearning modules in increasing knowledge about pediatric and reproductive environmental health. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 994 users who had completed at least one of the 12 PEHSU eLearning modules and its associated pre-test and post-test scores between March 2016 and November 2018. Users who completed modules between March 2016 and April 2018 received a 6-month follow-up survey to assess the impact of the knowledge gained on their clinical practice. Results A wide range of clinical professionals and nonclinical professionals utilized and completed the PEHSU eLearning modules. For all users, post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores, with an increase of 30.55% ± 22.37 (paired t-test, p < 0.0001), after completion of eLearning modules. Conclusion PEHSU eLearning modules are effective at increasing environmental health knowledge of clinical and nonclinical professionals. Further studies are needed to determine long-term knowledge retention and clinical impact.

Que nous enseignent les médecines traditionnelles ?

Abstract: Partout sur la planète, pour les peuples autochtones, ou racines, la santé résulte d’un équilibre entre humains, univers invisible et monde physique. Les médecines traditionnelles des peuples racines (que l’on nomme aussi premiers ou autochtones), connaissent un regain d’attention, alors qu’elles sont menacées par la perte des savoirs et la disparition des plantes de leur pharmacopée. Depuis quelques décennies, leur préservation est encouragée par l’Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS). Moins onéreuses que la médecine moderne, plus accessibles aux populations locales, elles bénéficient d’une bonne réputation sur les maux du quotidien. Pour des pathologies plus graves (non infectieuses), les témoignages de guérison sont nombreux. Mais les résultats sont difficiles à quantifier car ils sont liés au praticien, à des pratiques variées, comme à l’histoire même du patient, et demeurent souvent inexplicables. Quoi qu’il en soit, préserver ces médecines recèle un bénéfice : elles portent en elles les représentations de ces peuples. Alternate abstract: All over the planet, for native peoples, or First Nations, health results from a balance between humans, the invisible universe and the physical world. The traditional medicines of the First Nations (also known as native peoples) are receiving renewed attention, while they are threatened by the loss of knowledge and the disappearance of plants from their pharmacopoeia. For several decades, their preservation has been encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO). Less expensive than modern medicine, more accessible to local populations, they have a good reputation for everyday illnesses. For more serious (non-infectious) pathologies, there are many testimonies of healing. But the results are difficult to quantify because they are linked to the practitioner, to various practices, the patient's own medical history, and often remain inexplicable. In any event, preserving these medicines has a benefit: they carry within them the representations of these peoples.

Abstract: This study examines the long‐term retention of anatomical knowledge from 180 students after various repetition activities. The retention of anatomical knowledge was assessed by multiple‐choice tests at five different points in time: before and after a course in Functional Anatomy, before and after repetition activities that occurred 14 weeks after this course, and 28 weeks after this course to establish long‐term retention. Students were divided into five groups: one without any repetition activity, one with a restricted repetition activity (the multiple‐choice test), and three groups that were offered repetition activities (traditional lecture, e‐learning module, and small group work in the dissection room). During all three repetition activities the same information was conveyed, and this content was not revisited in other courses for the duration of the study. The results showed that students who did not engage in a repetition activity scored significantly lower on the long‐term retention test compared to all other groups (ANCOVA: P  = 0.0001). Pair‐wise comparison with estimated means showed that the other four groups, regardless of the type of repeating activity, did not differ in the amount of knowledge they retained during any of the five assessments ( P  = 0.008, P  = 0.0001, P  = 0.001, and P  = 0.0001, respectively). This study suggests that the type of repetition activity has no effect on knowledge retention both immediately following the activity and in the long term. It is concluded that the repetition of anatomical knowledge in any form is beneficial for students and will likely improve student outcomes in a curriculum that builds on prior knowledge.

Abstract: The European Association for Cardio Thoracic Surgery and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons endorse Cardiac Surgical Unit-Advanced Life Support, a protocol designed specifically for cardiothoracic surgical patients who suffer postoperative cardiac arrests. To enhance patient outcomes and to reduce death rates, cardiothoracic intensive care unit nurses must be able to perform the protocol with confidence, proficiency, and without delays. To this end, simulation-based learning (SBL) is a pedagogical method ideal for optimized learning. BACKGROUND The European Association for Cardio Thoracic Surgery and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons endorse Cardiac Surgical Unit-Advanced Life Support, a protocol designed specifically for cardiothoracic surgical patients who suffer postoperative cardiac arrests. To enhance patient outcomes and to reduce death rates, cardiothoracic intensive care unit nurses must be able to perform the protocol with confidence, proficiency, and without delays. To this end, simulation-based learning (SBL) is a pedagogical method ideal for optimized learning.This quality improvement project was designed to implement a post-cardiac surgery resuscitation protocol in a nonacademic, community medical center to enhance nurse knowledge, confidence, and proficiency for optimal patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES This quality improvement project was designed to implement a post-cardiac surgery resuscitation protocol in a nonacademic, community medical center to enhance nurse knowledge, confidence, and proficiency for optimal patient outcomes.The Cardiac Surgical Unit-Advanced Life Support is an evidence-based resuscitation protocol that was implemented using didactic, hands-on training, and SBL. It was evaluated using knowledge surveys, comparisons in nurse confidence and performance measures, and patient outcomes data. METHODS The Cardiac Surgical Unit-Advanced Life Support is an evidence-based resuscitation protocol that was implemented using didactic, hands-on training, and SBL. It was evaluated using knowledge surveys, comparisons in nurse confidence and performance measures, and patient outcomes data.Nurses' knowledge gains (ie, mean test scores) on our test were statistically significant between 3 time points (F2,60 = 81.204, P < .001). Knowledge significantly increased from pre-education to immediate post-education (P < .001), but declined from immediate post-education to 3-month post-education assessments (P < .001); however, the 3-month post knowledge mean was still higher than the pre-education knowledge mean (P < .001). Nurses were confident in their ability to apply the protocol, although results failed to show a correlation between confidence and performance ability. Statistical significance for delay in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was found between pre- and post-nursing education patient cardiac arrest events (P = .05). RESULTS Nurses' knowledge gains (ie, mean test scores) on our test were statistically significant between 3 time points (F2,60 = 81.204, P < .001). Knowledge significantly increased from pre-education to immediate post-education (P < .001), but declined from immediate post-education to 3-month post-education assessments (P < .001); however, the 3-month post knowledge mean was still higher than the pre-education knowledge mean (P < .001). Nurses were confident in their ability to apply the protocol, although results failed to show a correlation between confidence and performance ability. Statistical significance for delay in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was found between pre- and post-nursing education patient cardiac arrest events (P = .05).Didactic and hands-on learning supported knowledge retention over time for cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit nurses. Improving self-confidence and the application of an unfamiliar resuscitation protocol through SBL and any impact a training program has on patient outcomes will require ongoing practice and more evaluation. CONCLUSIONS Didactic and hands-on learning supported knowledge retention over time for cardiothoracic surgical intensive care unit nurses. Improving self-confidence and the application of an unfamiliar resuscitation protocol through SBL and any impact a training program has on patient outcomes will require ongoing practice and more evaluation.

Abstract: To determine baseline knowledge of emergency medicine (EM) residents at 2 different residency training programs and assess if a 4-week orthopedic surgery rotation would improve musculoskeletal (MSK) knowledge as assessed by the basic competency exam (BCE). This study also sought to compare variations of the BCE to determine how emergency physicians would perform on the full 25-question assessment vs a modified 18-question test. OBJECTIVE To determine baseline knowledge of emergency medicine (EM) residents at 2 different residency training programs and assess if a 4-week orthopedic surgery rotation would improve musculoskeletal (MSK) knowledge as assessed by the basic competency exam (BCE). This study also sought to compare variations of the BCE to determine how emergency physicians would perform on the full 25-question assessment vs a modified 18-question test.Residents from 2 different EM residency training programs were given the BCE to determine baseline MSK knowledge prior to their orthopedic surgery rotations. A postrotation BCE was given to the residents from both EM training programs upon completion of their orthopedic surgery rotation. Both prerotation and postrotation tests were reviewed and scored independently by a panel of experts and later assessed by 2 independent reviewers. DESIGN Residents from 2 different EM residency training programs were given the BCE to determine baseline MSK knowledge prior to their orthopedic surgery rotations. A postrotation BCE was given to the residents from both EM training programs upon completion of their orthopedic surgery rotation. Both prerotation and postrotation tests were reviewed and scored independently by a panel of experts and later assessed by 2 independent reviewers.San Antonio Military Medical Center, SA Tx Level I Trauma, Tertiary Care Center University of Texas Health, SA, Tx, Level 1 Trauma, Tertiary Care Center. SETTING San Antonio Military Medical Center, SA Tx Level I Trauma, Tertiary Care Center University of Texas Health, SA, Tx, Level 1 Trauma, Tertiary Care Center.A total of 54 EM residents completed both the prerotation test and pos-rotation test. PARTICIPANTS A total of 54 EM residents completed both the prerotation test and pos-rotation test.EM residents at both programs had significantly improved test scores after an orthopedic surgery rotation. Baselines scores of PGY-2 residents were higher than PGY-1 residents. RESULTS EM residents at both programs had significantly improved test scores after an orthopedic surgery rotation. Baselines scores of PGY-2 residents were higher than PGY-1 residents.EM residents can improve their competency in MSK education with a 4-week rotation in orthopedic surgery. Further studies are needed to determine knowledge retention and to identify components of an optimal orthopedic rotation. CONCLUSIONS EM residents can improve their competency in MSK education with a 4-week rotation in orthopedic surgery. Further studies are needed to determine knowledge retention and to identify components of an optimal orthopedic rotation.

Abstract: Content and training about pediatric environmental health are lacking in healthcare professionals' education. In an initiative to improve pediatric environmental health education, the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) program offers free, interactive, web-based ("eLearning") modules on environmental health topics. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PEHSU eLearning modules in increasing knowledge about pediatric and reproductive environmental health. OBJECTIVE Content and training about pediatric environmental health are lacking in healthcare professionals' education. In an initiative to improve pediatric environmental health education, the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) program offers free, interactive, web-based ("eLearning") modules on environmental health topics. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PEHSU eLearning modules in increasing knowledge about pediatric and reproductive environmental health.This is a retrospective analysis of 994 users who had completed at least one of the 12 PEHSU eLearning modules and its associated pre-test and post-test scores between March 2016 and November 2018. Users who completed modules between March 2016 and April 2018 received a 6-month follow-up survey to assess the impact of the knowledge gained on their clinical practice. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of 994 users who had completed at least one of the 12 PEHSU eLearning modules and its associated pre-test and post-test scores between March 2016 and November 2018. Users who completed modules between March 2016 and April 2018 received a 6-month follow-up survey to assess the impact of the knowledge gained on their clinical practice.A wide range of clinical professionals and nonclinical professionals utilized and completed the PEHSU eLearning modules. For all users, post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores, with an increase of 30.55% ± 22.37 (paired t-test, p < 0.0001), after completion of eLearning modules. RESULTS A wide range of clinical professionals and nonclinical professionals utilized and completed the PEHSU eLearning modules. For all users, post-test scores were significantly higher than pre-test scores, with an increase of 30.55% ± 22.37 (paired t-test, p < 0.0001), after completion of eLearning modules.PEHSU eLearning modules are effective at increasing environmental health knowledge of clinical and nonclinical professionals. Further studies are needed to determine long-term knowledge retention and clinical impact. CONCLUSION PEHSU eLearning modules are effective at increasing environmental health knowledge of clinical and nonclinical professionals. Further studies are needed to determine long-term knowledge retention and clinical impact.

Abstract: This study examines the long-term retention of anatomical knowledge from 180 students after various repetition activities. The retention of anatomical knowledge was assessed by multiple-choice tests at five different points in time: before and after a course in Functional Anatomy, before and after repetition activities that occurred 14 weeks after this course, and 28 weeks after this course to establish long-term retention. Students were divided into five groups: one without any repetition activity, one with a restricted repetition activity (the multiple-choice test), and three groups that were offered repetition activities (traditional lecture, e-learning module, and small group work in the dissection room). During all three repetition activities the same information was conveyed, and this content was not revisited in other courses for the duration of the study. The results showed that students who did not engage in a repetition activity scored significantly lower on the long-term retention test compared to all other groups (ANCOVA: P = 0.0001). Pair-wise comparison with estimated means showed that the other four groups, regardless of the type of repeating activity, did not differ in the amount of knowledge they retained during any of the five assessments (P = 0.008, P = 0.0001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.0001, respectively). This study suggests that the type of repetition activity has no effect on knowledge retention both immediately following the activity and in the long term. It is concluded that the repetition of anatomical knowledge in any form is beneficial for students and will likely improve student outcomes in a curriculum that builds on prior knowledge.This study examines the long-term retention of anatomical knowledge from 180 students after various repetition activities.

Abstract: Introduction One purpose of the hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HOCPR) program is to simplify CPR instruction to encourage more bystanders to take action during cardiac arrest. Although the program has been successfully implemented in traditional classroom settings, the utility of large-scale training events has not been well-explored. We hypothesized that CPR knowledge and comfort levels would increase through a large-scale, multi-community HOCPR training event. We also explored what effect this training event had on perceived barriers to bystander-performed CPR. Methods A convenience sample participated in HOCPR training on a single day across 10 Texas cities. A sub-sample completed training questionnaires, including a five-item CPR pre- and post-test. A follow-up questionnaire was conducted two years after the event. The primary outcome of interest was the difference in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) knowledge and comfort level between pre- and post-event questionnaires. Demographic contributions were also assessed. Results A total of 4,253 participants were trained, 1,416 were enrolled upon submitting matching pre- and post-event questionnaires, and 101 (14%) submitted follow-up questionnaires. Mean knowledge scores increased from pre-training (2.7 ± 1.6 standard deviation (SD)) to post-training (4.7 ± 0.76 SD) (p < 0.001). Follow-up test scores (3.8 ± 1.1 SD) remained higher than pre-test scores (p < 0.001). Comfort with HOCPR increased from 59% (95% confidence interval (CI) 56 - 61) to 96% (95% CI 95 - 97). Pre- and post-knowledge scores differed significantly by education level (p < 0.001), ethnicity (p < 0.001), and income (p < 0.001). Education contributed significantly to comfort at both pre- (p = 0.015) and post-training (p = 0.026), but ethnicity and income did not. Before training, the most common barrier to performing CPR was lack of knowledge 59% (95% CI 55 - 62); after training, the most common barrier was fear of causing harm 34% (95% CI 29 - 40). Conclusions This study demonstrated that medical students were successfully able to conduct large-scale HOCPR training that improved CPR knowledge and comfort levels among participants across multiple metropolitan areas. Knowledge retention remained higher at two-years for participants of a follow-up questionnaire. Medical students can use the experiences from this training event as a template to organize similar large-scale training events in the future.Introduction One purpose of the hands-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (HOCPR) program is to simplify CPR instruction to encourage more bystanders to take action during cardiac arrest.

Abstract: Missions were established in California in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to convert Native Americans to Christianity and enculturate them into a class of laborers for Californios (Spanish/Mexican settler). The concentration of large numbers of Native Americans at the Missions, along with the introduction of European diseases, led to serious disease problems. Medicinal supplies brought to California by the missionaries were limited in quantity. This situation resulted in an opportunity for the sharing of knowledge of medicinal plants between the Native Americans and the Mission priests. The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which such sharing of knowledge took place and to understand factors that may have influenced the sharing of medicinal knowledge. The study also examines the sharing of medicinal knowledge between the Native Americans and the Californios following the demise of the California Missions. BACKGROUND Missions were established in California in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to convert Native Americans to Christianity and enculturate them into a class of laborers for Californios (Spanish/Mexican settler). The concentration of large numbers of Native Americans at the Missions, along with the introduction of European diseases, led to serious disease problems. Medicinal supplies brought to California by the missionaries were limited in quantity. This situation resulted in an opportunity for the sharing of knowledge of medicinal plants between the Native Americans and the Mission priests. The purpose of this study is to examine the degree to which such sharing of knowledge took place and to understand factors that may have influenced the sharing of medicinal knowledge. The study also examines the sharing of medicinal knowledge between the Native Americans and the Californios following the demise of the California Missions.Two methods were employed in the study: (1) a comparison of lists of medicinal plants used by various groups (e.g., Native American, Mission priests, Californios) prior to, during, and after the Mission period and (2) a close reading of diaries, reports, and books written by first-hand observers and modern authorities to find accounts of and identify factors influencing the exchange of medicinal information. METHODS Two methods were employed in the study: (1) a comparison of lists of medicinal plants used by various groups (e.g., Native American, Mission priests, Californios) prior to, during, and after the Mission period and (2) a close reading of diaries, reports, and books written by first-hand observers and modern authorities to find accounts of and identify factors influencing the exchange of medicinal information.A comparison of the lists of medicinal plants use by various groups indicated that only a small percentage of medicinal plants were shared by two or more groups. For example, none of the 265 taxa of species used by the Native Americans in pre-Mission times were imported into Spain for medicinal use and only 16 taxa were reported to have been used at the Missions. A larger sharing of information of medicinal plants took place in the post-Mission period when Native Americans were dispersed from the Missions and worked as laborers on the ranches of the Californios. RESULTS A comparison of the lists of medicinal plants use by various groups indicated that only a small percentage of medicinal plants were shared by two or more groups. For example, none of the 265 taxa of species used by the Native Americans in pre-Mission times were imported into Spain for medicinal use and only 16 taxa were reported to have been used at the Missions. A larger sharing of information of medicinal plants took place in the post-Mission period when Native Americans were dispersed from the Missions and worked as laborers on the ranches of the Californios.Sharing of information concerning medicinal plants did occur during the Mission period, but the number of documented species was limited. A number of possible factors discouraged this exchange. These include (1) imbalance of power between the priests and the Native Americans, (2) suppression of indigenous knowledge and medical practices by the Mission priests, (3) language barriers, (4) reduction of availability of medicinal herbs around the Mission due to introduced agricultural practices, (5) desire to protect knowledge of medicinal herbs by Native American shaman, (6) administrative structure at the Missions which left little time for direct interaction between the priests and individual Native Americans, (7) loss of knowledge of herbal medicine by the Native Americans over time at the Missions, and (8) limited transportation opportunities for reciprocal the shipment of medicinal plants between California and Spain. Three possible factors were identified that contributed to a greater sharing of information between the Native Americans and the Californios in the post-Mission period. These were (1) more one-to-one interactions between the Californios and the Native Americans, (2) many of the Californios were mestizos whose mothers or grandmothers were Native Americans, and (3) lack of pressure on the part of the Californios to suppress Native American beliefs and medicinal practices.

Abstract: Advances in the portability of ultrasound have allowed it to be increasingly employed at the point of care in austere settings. Battlefield constraints often limit the availability of medical officers throughout the operational environment, leading to increased interest in whether highly portable ultrasound devices can be employed by military medics to enhance their provision of combat casualty care. Data evaluating optimal training for effective medic employment of ultrasound is limited however. This prospective observational cohort study's primary objective was to assess the impact of a 4-hour introductory training intervention on ultrasound-naïve military medic participants' knowledge/performance of the eFAST application. INTRODUCTION Advances in the portability of ultrasound have allowed it to be increasingly employed at the point of care in austere settings. Battlefield constraints often limit the availability of medical officers throughout the operational environment, leading to increased interest in whether highly portable ultrasound devices can be employed by military medics to enhance their provision of combat casualty care. Data evaluating optimal training for effective medic employment of ultrasound is limited however. This prospective observational cohort study's primary objective was to assess the impact of a 4-hour introductory training intervention on ultrasound-naïve military medic participants' knowledge/performance of the eFAST application.Conventional U.S. Army Medics, all naïve to ultrasound, were recruited from across JBLM. Volunteer participants underwent baseline eFAST knowledge assessment via a 50-question multiple-choice exam. Participants were then randomized to receive either conventional, expert-led classroom didactic training or didactic training via an online, asynchronously available platform. All participants then underwent expert-led, small group hands-on training and practice. Participants' eFAST performance was then assessed with both live and phantom models, followed by a post-course knowledge exam. Concurrently, emergency medicine (EM) resident physician volunteers, serving as standard criterion for trained personnel, underwent the same OSCE assessments, followed by a written exam to assess their baseline eFAST knowledge. Primary outcome measures included (1) post-course knowledge improvement, (2) eFAST exam technical adequacy, and (3) eFAST exam OSCE score. Secondary outcome measures were time to exam completion and diagnostic accuracy rate for hemoperitoneum and hemopericardium. These outcome measures were then compared across medic cohorts and to those of the EM resident physician cohort.

These outcome measures were then compared across medic cohorts and to those of the EM resident physician cohort.A total of 34 medics completed the study. After 4 hours of ultrasound training, overall eFAST knowledge among the 34 medics improved from a baseline mean of 27% on the pretest to 83% post-test. For eFAST exam performance, the medics scored an average of 20.8 out of a maximum of 22 points on the OSCE. There were no statistically significant differences between the medics who received asynchronous learning versus traditional classroom-based learning, and the medics demonstrated comparable performance to previously trained EM resident physicians.

Online, asynchronously available platforms may effectively mitigate some of the resource requirement burden associated with point-of-care ultrasound training. Future studies evaluating medic eFAST performance on real-world battlefield trauma patients are needed. Skill and knowledge retention must also be assessed for this degradable skill to determine frequency of refresher training when not regularly performed.

Abstract: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently demonstrate aggression and externalizing behaviors in the acute care hospital environment. Pediatric acute care nursing staff are often not trained in managing aggression and, in particular, lack confidence in preventing and managing externalizing behaviors in children with ASD. High-fidelity simulation exercises will be used in this study to provide deliberate practice for acute care pediatric nursing staff in the management of aggressive and externalizing behaviors. BACKGROUND Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently demonstrate aggression and externalizing behaviors in the acute care hospital environment. Pediatric acute care nursing staff are often not trained in managing aggression and, in particular, lack confidence in preventing and managing externalizing behaviors in children with ASD. High-fidelity simulation exercises will be used in this study to provide deliberate practice for acute care pediatric nursing staff in the management of aggressive and externalizing behaviors.The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot and feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of simulation-based education for staff in managing aggression and externalizing behaviors of children with ASD in the hospital setting. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot and feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of simulation-based education for staff in managing aggression and externalizing behaviors of children with ASD in the hospital setting.This study has a mixed design, with between-group and within-participant comparisons to explore the acceptability and feasibility of delivering a large-scale cluster RCT. The trial process, including recruitment, completion rates, contamination, and completion of outcome measures, will be assessed and reported as percentages. This study will assess the acceptability of the simulation-based training format for two scenarios involving an adolescent with autism, with or without intellectual disability, who displays aggressive and externalizing behaviors and the resulting change in confidence in managing clinical aggression. Two pediatric wards of similar size and patient complexity will be selected to participate in the study; they will be randomized to receive either simulation-based education plus web-based educational materials or the web-based educational materials only. Change in confidence will be assessed using pre- and posttraining surveys for bedside nursing staff exposed to the training and the control group who will receive the web-based training materials. Knowledge retention 3 months posttraining, as well as continued confidence and exposure to clinical aggression, will be assessed via surveys. Changes in confidence and competence will be compared statistically with the chi-square test using before-and-after data to compare the proportion of those who have high confidence between the two arms at baseline and at follow-up. The simulation-based education will be recorded with trained assessors reviewing participants' abilities to de-escalate aggressive behaviors using a validated tool. This data will be analyzed using mean values and SDs to understand the variation in performance of individuals who undertake the training. Data from each participating ward will be collected during each shift for the duration of the study to assess the number of aggressive incidents and successful de-escalation for patients with ASD. Total change in Code Grey activations will also be assessed, with both datasets analyzed using descriptive statistics.

Abstract: Objectives The Ethiopian government designed the SURE program which aims to reduce the prevalence of stunting by improving complementary feeding and dietary diversity as part of its national nutrition program. This study was conducted to test the feasibility of the SURE program before its implementation. Methods A qualitative research design with purposive sampling was employed for this study. A five-day overall SURE program training was provided for 6 health extension workers (HEWs) and 10 agriculture extension workers (AEWs). Trainees completed pre-post knowledge tests. Following their training, two pairs of health and agriculture extension workers jointly conducted household visits in each of three selected kebeles (sub-unit of district) to assess needs and counsel mother-father pairs. They also facilitated women's and men's group dialogues to reinforce messages in gender-specific peer groups. Research assistants and investigators observed 12 joint household visits. To further assess the program, 24 semi-structured interviews with extension workers and mother-father pairs and 6 focus group discussions with men's and women's groups were conducted. Data were analyzed using Nvivo version 11. Results Health and agriculture extension workers gained demonstrable knowledge about infant and young child feeding and nutrition-sensitive agricultural practices following their training, but they largely failed to apply the 3A's counselling process (assess, analyze and act) and delivered inconsistent messages during the counselling visits based on observation. However, they felt that they can realistically continue to work together. Pairs of mothers and fathers visited were supportive of the joint HEWs and AEWs visits. Focus group discussants from women's groups reported that segregating the group discussions by gender was helpful to ensure their participation and expression of ideas. Conclusions The SURE training provided to HEWs and AEWs resulted in knowledge retention. The integrated service delivery model of the SURE program is well-accepted by both extension workers and mother-father pairs. Further support to build counselling skills will be needed to improve program processes and the quality of services. Funding Sources Childrens' Investment Fund Foundation (UK) funded this research. No other involvement in carrying out the research activities.

Abstract: Collaborative testing blends collaborative learning and assessment, engaging small groups of students in answering exam questions as a team. Previous studies have shown that collaborative testing promotes increased student performance and short-term knowledge retention over individual testing alone. In this mixed-methods study, we examined the effects of collaborative testing on preclinical medical students' long-term retention of basic science knowledge, as well as students' approaches and perceptions of collaborative testing. Small groups of students consecutively experienced two conditions after their individual exams: collaborative testing, where they answered half of the exam questions together, and group exam review, where they discussed the other half of the questions with answers provided. Eight months later, students individually took a post-test that included a subset of the questions they had previously encountered in the context of collaborative testing and a subset of questions from group exam review. We found that both post-test performance and knowledge retained from initial individual exam to post-test were significantly higher for the collaborative testing condition. Qualitative findings suggest that knowledge retention was enhanced by collaborative processes and repeated knowledge retrieval elicited by collaborative testing. While students were appreciative of opportunities to discuss ideas and work as a team, many expressed negative opinions about not being certain of correct answers and experiencing interpersonal conflict in collaborative testing. We discuss implications of these findings to enhance design of collaborative testing opportunities and learning environments that support knowledge retention, productive views of authority and certainty of knowledge, and effective collaborative practice.Collaborative testing blends collaborative learning and assessment, engaging small groups of students in answering exam questions as a team.

Abstract: Despite recent evidence demonstrating the benefits of case-based and active learning strategies in medical education, many medical schools have reduced or entirely eliminated teaching laboratories in medical microbiology courses. The objective of our investigation was to analyze the impact of a voluntary hands-on microbiology laboratory session on students' knowledge retention and ability to apply the underlying principles to exam questions in our Introduction to Infectious Diseases (IID) course. BACKGROUND Despite recent evidence demonstrating the benefits of case-based and active learning strategies in medical education, many medical schools have reduced or entirely eliminated teaching laboratories in medical microbiology courses. The objective of our investigation was to analyze the impact of a voluntary hands-on microbiology laboratory session on students' knowledge retention and ability to apply the underlying principles to exam questions in our Introduction to Infectious Diseases (IID) course.We compared the performance of students participating in the wet labs with those who did not, analyzing scores on exam questions directly related to the concepts presented in the laboratory session and their overall scores on the IID module exam. The voluntary nature of our microbiology lab session provided a unique opportunity to assess its impact on knowledge retention independent of other factors, such as lecture and exam content, etc. Data were collected for 7 academic years and analyzed in aggregate. METHODS We compared the performance of students participating in the wet labs with those who did not, analyzing scores on exam questions directly related to the concepts presented in the laboratory session and their overall scores on the IID module exam. The voluntary nature of our microbiology lab session provided a unique opportunity to assess its impact on knowledge retention independent of other factors, such as lecture and exam content, etc. Data were collected for 7 academic years and analyzed in aggregate.Students who attended voluntary lab sessions scored higher on exam questions related to lab exercises than students who did not attend (Mann-Whitney, p  = 0.0074). These results support the benefit of reexamining material originally presented during classroom sessions in an active, collaborative learning environment. Course evaluation responses indicted that students valued the opportunity to visually reinforce concepts they had previously read in a textbook or heard in lectures. RESULTS Students who attended voluntary lab sessions scored higher on exam questions related to lab exercises than students who did not attend (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.0074).

Course evaluation responses indicted that students valued the opportunity to visually reinforce concepts they had previously read in a textbook or heard in lectures.At a time when many medical schools are reducing or eliminating hands-on lab sessions in microbiology and other basic sciences, our results highlight the benefits of this teaching strategy. The laboratory session provided an opportunity for students to revisit concepts initially presented in the traditional classroom setting and to actively engage in applying these concepts to case-based scenarios. The improved educational outcomes will benefit students in future standardized exams as well as in their professional practice.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global healthcare problem and therefore raising awareness within young learners is imperative. An AMR roadshow was designed to take key stage 4 students' learning 'out of the classroom', assess pre-existing knowledge of AMR and determine the impact of the roadshow on knowledge retention. Knowledge and subsequent retention were measured pre- and post-event through a standardised questionnaire. The roadshow significantly improved knowledge and understanding of AMR, which was retained for a minimum of twelve weeks. Engaging and interactive strategies addressing key health issues provide a positive learning experience which contributes to retained knowledge in young learners.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global healthcare problem and therefore raising awareness within young learners is imperative.

Abstract: Background: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently demonstrate aggression and externalizing behaviors in the acute care hospital environment. Pediatric acute care nursing staff are often not trained in managing aggression and, in particular, lack confidence in preventing and managing externalizing behaviors in children with ASD. High-fidelity simulation exercises will be used in this study to provide deliberate practice for acute care pediatric nursing staff in the management of aggressive and externalizing behaviors. Objective: The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot and feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of simulation-based education for staff in managing aggression and externalizing behaviors of children with ASD in the hospital setting. Methods: This study has a mixed design, with between-group and within-participant comparisons to explore the acceptability and feasibility of delivering a large-scale cluster RCT. The trial process, including recruitment, completion rates, contamination, and completion of outcome measures, will be assessed and reported as percentages. This study will assess the acceptability of the simulation-based training format for two scenarios involving an adolescent with autism, with or without intellectual disability, who displays aggressive and externalizing behaviors and the resulting change in confidence in managing clinical aggression. Two pediatric wards of similar size and patient complexity will be selected to participate in the study; they will be randomized to receive either simulation-based education plus web-based educational materials or the web-based educational materials only. Change in confidence will be assessed using pre- and posttraining surveys for bedside nursing staff exposed to the training and the control group who will receive the web-based training materials. Knowledge retention 3 months posttraining, as well as continued confidence and exposure to clinical aggression, will be assessed via surveys. Changes in confidence and competence will be compared statistically with the chi-square test using before-and-after data to compare the proportion of those who have high confidence between the two arms at baseline and at follow-up. The simulation-based education will be recorded with trained assessors reviewing participants’ abilities to de-escalate aggressive behaviors using a validated tool. This data will be analyzed using mean values and SDs to understand the variation in performance of individuals who undertake the training. Data from each participating ward will be collected during each shift for the duration of the study to assess the number of aggressive incidents and successful de-escalation for patients with ASD. Total change in Code Grey activations will also be assessed, with both datasets analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: This study gained ethical approval from The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) on November 1, 2019 (HREC reference number: 56684). Data collection was completed in February 2020. Data analysis is due to commence with results anticipated by August 2020. Conclusions: We hypothesize that this study is feasible to be conducted as a cluster RCT and that simulation-based training will be acceptable for acute care pediatric nurses. We anticipate that the intervention ward will have increased confidence in managing clinical aggression in children with ASD immediately and up to 3 months posttraining.

Abstract: Educational escape rooms assist students with the development of teamwork, augmentation of problem-solving skills, and reinforcement of key course concepts. In this report, we examined the feasibility of creating a bioterror preparedness escape room in a small enrollment pharmacy public health elective course. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Educational escape rooms assist students with the development of teamwork, augmentation of problem-solving skills, and reinforcement of key course concepts. In this report, we examined the feasibility of creating a bioterror preparedness escape room in a small enrollment pharmacy public health elective course.A bioterror preparedness escape room was developed for pharmacy students in a health elective course. The instructional objectives of training students in disaster preparedness were assessed via group readiness assessment tests in the scenario and individual readiness assessment tests after the completion of the activity. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING A bioterror preparedness escape room was developed for pharmacy students in a health elective course. The instructional objectives of training students in disaster preparedness were assessed via group readiness assessment tests in the scenario and individual readiness assessment tests after the completion of the activity.Twenty-eight students participated in the escape room activity in groups of 6 to 8 students (n = 4 observations) and all groups escaped. Student performance was higher on the initial attempts of three group readiness assessment tests (88 ± 16.0%, 82 ± 7.1%, 78 ± 12.0%) than in the final individual readiness assessment test (73.4 ± 20.4%). Students indicated that they found the educational escape room to be enjoyable (95.7%) and felt that all members of the team were involved in solving the problems (86.9%). FINDINGS Twenty-eight students participated in the escape room activity in groups of 6 to 8 students (n = 4 observations) and all groups escaped. Student performance was higher on the initial attempts of three group readiness assessment tests (88 ± 16.0%, 82 ± 7.1%, 78 ± 12.0%) than in the final individual readiness assessment test (73.4 ± 20.4%). Students indicated that they found the educational escape room to be enjoyable (95.7%) and felt that all members of the team were involved in solving the problems (86.9%).A disaster preparedness educational escape room was designed and implemented in a public health elective for pharmacy students. Findings indicate that the educational escape room format is an effective method for reinforcing course content, however additional improvements could be made to the instructional design to enhance individual student knowledge retention. SUMMARY A disaster preparedness educational escape room was designed and implemented in a public health elective for pharmacy students.

Abstract: Few discussions regarding instructional methods incite as much passion as the debate over dissection versus prosection. Despite numerous analyses, few studies have isolated the impact of dissection versus prosection from the numerous variables that are involved in anatomy education. This study used a retrospective design to assess the effect of peer teaching with dissection or prosection on anatomical knowledge retention of the peer teachers. Exam scores were analyzed from three cohorts of students ( N = 184) who were enrolled in a Musculoskeletal System course in an allopathic medical school between academic years 2014-2017. Students in the first 2 yr learned anatomy of an assigned region through traditional dissection, whereas students in the third year learned anatomy of the same regions on prosected specimens. The effect of these instructional methods on anatomical knowledge retention was measured by student performance on a teaching-readiness quiz, written exam, and practical examination. One advantage of this study is the stability of variables between cohorts. Student groups peer taught the same objectives; course sequencing and content remained consistent between years; students spent the same amount of time learning their material, regardless of learning modality (dissection or prosection); and students were tested in the same manner. Comparisons of student performance data suggest that anatomy knowledge was equivalent, regardless of the instructional method (dissection or prosected cadavers) but is strongly associated with prior anatomy experience. Findings from this study support previous studies that conclude that there are no disparities in the effectiveness of learning anatomy via dissection or prosection.Few discussions regarding instructional methods incite as much passion as the debate over dissection versus prosection.

Abstract: The rarity of perianesthetic catastrophic events creates a challenge in training support staff in the treatment of emergencies such as local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Simulation learning offers a unique venue in which to safely encounter rare events. BACKGROUND The rarity of perianesthetic catastrophic events creates a challenge in training support staff in the treatment of emergencies such as local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Simulation learning offers a unique venue in which to safely encounter rare events.This study aimed to evaluate knowledge retention regarding LAST in perianesthetic nursing staff using high-fidelity simulation and a short didactic session. AIMS This study aimed to evaluate knowledge retention regarding LAST in perianesthetic nursing staff using high-fidelity simulation and a short didactic session.Nurses were recruited from perioperative locations to participate in a simulated scenario of LAST and engage in a short didactic session. DESIGN Nurses were recruited from perioperative locations to participate in a simulated scenario of LAST and engage in a short didactic session.Simulation and education occurred in the high-fidelity simulation center at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. SETTINGS Simulation and education occurred in the high-fidelity simulation center at the University of Wisconsin Hospital.Thirteen nurses from the preoperative, post-anesthesia, and block nursing teams participated in the study. PARTICIPANTS/SUBJECTS Thirteen nurses from the preoperative, post-anesthesia, and block nursing teams participated in the study.Participants completed a pre-test before participating in the simulation, followed by a formal debrief and short lecture. They then completed post-tests and a short survey focused on self-efficacy and review of the simulation experience. METHODS Participants completed a pre-test before participating in the simulation, followed by a formal debrief and short lecture. They then completed post-tests and a short survey focused on self-efficacy and review of the simulation experience.Test scores, compared to the pre-test, improved significantly on the immediately-post, 1-month, and 3-month assessments. Participants felt more equipped to handle crisis scenarios. RESULTS Test scores, compared to the pre-test, improved significantly on the immediately-post, 1-month, and 3-month assessments. Participants felt more equipped to handle crisis scenarios.Experiential learning often results in significant knowledge acquisition and retention. Participants in this study improved their test scores regarding LAST and increased their sense of self-efficacy and ability to handle crisis scenarios after taking part in a high-fidelity simulation. CONCLUSIONS Experiential learning often results in significant knowledge acquisition and retention. Participants in this study improved their test scores regarding LAST and increased their sense of self-efficacy and ability to handle crisis scenarios after taking part in a high-fidelity simulation.

Abstract: Objective. To model the relationship of common pharmacy education assessment data including student demographics, pre-pharmacy performance, core didactic performance, and external testing measures to identify predictors of student readiness for advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). Methods. The associations between 23 predictive covariates from 226 graduating students from 2015-2018 (5786 observations) and APPE readiness as measured by midpoint core APPE scores were modeled. Multiple linear and Poisson regression models with backward selection were used. A selection criterion ofp >.10 was used for covariate elimination írom the model. Three models were evaluated: average of all midpoint core APPE rotation scores; average of midpoint acute care pharmacy practice and ambulatory care APPE rotation scores; and number of midpoint core clerkship failing scores. Results. The average age of the population at admission was 25.464.5 years, 47% were female, and 75.2% had prior degrees. Across the three prediction models, knowledge-retention covariates were the strongest predictors. Total score on the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment was a modest yet consistent predictor across the models. All other significant predictors were unique to the various models. Conclusion. This four-year, population-based modeling study of the relationship of common pharmacy education assessment data to APPE midpoint scores shows a modest correlation with knowledge-based measures. There is a need for greater innovation in this area of research.

Abstract: ABSTRACT As the oldest continuous living civilizations in the world, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have strength, tenacity, and resilience. Initial colonization of the landscape included violent dispossession and removal of people from Country to expand European land tenure and production systems, loss of knowledge holders through frontier violence, and formal government policies of segregation and assimilation designed to destroy ontological relationships with Country and kin. The ongoing manifestations of colonialism continue to affect food systems and food knowledges of Aboriginal peoples, and have led to severe health inequities and disproportionate rates of nutrition-related health conditions. There is an urgent need to collaborate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to address nutrition and its underlying determinants in a way that integrates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ understandings of food and food systems, health, healing, and well-being. We use the existing literature to discuss current ways that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are portrayed in the literature in relation to nutrition, identify knowledge gaps that require further research, and propose a new way forward.

Abstract: Objective: This study was conducted to investigate if crossword puzzles as active learning tools can improve the knowledge retention of nursing students in pharmacology of epilepsy and improve their performance in writing the correct spelling of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Methods: The present study was a randomized controlled prospective parallel study in which a control group design with pretests and posttests were used among nursing students. Students were randomly allocated to either control group (n = 114) who received routine learning or intervention group (n = 110) who received crossword puzzles. Both control and intervention groups had to complete multiple-choice question (MCQs) and spelling pretests and posttests. Results: Scores of the MCQs and spelling pretests were not statistically different (p-value > 0.05) for participants in all achievement categories in both control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, scores in the first and second MCQs and spelling posttests were significantly higher than their corresponding scores in the pretest scores for participants from the all achievement categories (p-value 0.05). Data analyses showed that there were significant normalized changes between scores of students in across all achievement categories. Conclusion: Findings of this study suggested that crossword puzzles were effective in improving the learning of nursing students about the pharmacology of epilepsy and writing correct spelling of AEDs. Educators should consider using crossword puzzles as active learning tools to improve knowledge of nursing students about the pharmacology of epilepsy.

Abstract: This study used immersive visualization technology for the delivery of material in geospatial science courses that focused on airborne light detection and ranging (lidar) and subsequent digital elevation model (DEM) development. Numerous immersive visualization solutions are now available and are becoming accessible for use in the classroom. As such, it is important to understand how and to what extent these technologies can improve the learning experience and enable greater retention by the student. The immersive visualization systems evaluated for this study included an Augmented Reality Sandtable (ARES) and the Geospatial Virtually Immersive Evaluation Workstation (GeoVIEW 3D) at the United States Military Academy's (West Point) Geospatial Science Laboratory. Experimental lessons that combined traditional lecture techniques with advanced visualization technology were compared with a control lesson comprised solely of a traditional lecture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact immersive technology systems have on students' grasp of geospatial data acquisition concepts. The results of this study provide evidence that the use of immersive visualization technology in the classroom improves short-term knowledge retention of the assessed concepts. In addition, visualization technology that requires personal equipment (PE) such as glasses or headsets has a greater potential to result in a negative experience for a portion of the student population. As instructors become more familiar with immersive visualization and the required technology becomes more accessible, instructors should consider the implications of using advanced visualization in the classroom and ensure it facilitates greater engagement and understanding among the students.

Abstract: Liberal arts programs encompass a range of academic disciplines, and their effectiveness relies not only on what these disciplines are, but also on how they are integrated. The natural sciences are one important component of liberal arts programs that may be difficult to assimilate with the rest of the curriculum. In this paper, the topic of neglected tropical diseases is provided to illustrate an innovative approach to bridging transdisciplinary connections across and through disparate academic disciplines. This approach is supported by evidence from prior studies demonstrating the effectiveness of transdisciplinary teaching at promoting creativity, knowledge retention, and student motivation.

Abstract: Background: In the midst of the international opioid-related overdose (OOD) crisis, appropriate naloxone training is needed by both healthcare professionals and community members to better leverage its life-saving potential. Objective: Pilot the use of a virtual reality simulation for training student nurses to identify signs and symptoms of an OOD, properly administer intranasal naloxone, and provide immediate recovery care after revival. Design: This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study evaluated knowledge and attitudes towards intervening during an opioid-related overdose among student nurses before and after participating in a traditional hybrid simulation or virtual reality simulation. Setting: A medium sized urban university's school of nursing in the Northeastern United States. Participants: Fifty (N = 50) senior Bachelor of Nursing Science (BSN) students. Methods: Knowledge and attitudes were assessed using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS). Students completed measures 3 weeks prior to training and 3 weeks after. Appropriate t-tests evaluated changes in OOAS and OOKS scores both within and between training groups (e.g. hybrid simulation compared to virtual reality). Results Sample characteristics were well balanced in both the hybrid simulation group (n = 31) and virtual reality group (n = 19). There were no statistically significant differences in average OOKS and OOAS scores at baseline or at follow up between those receiving hybrid simulation or the virtual reality training. All participants' attitudes scores decreased from baseline to follow up by <2 points. However, there was no difference in the change in knowledge scores between the training groups. Conclusions Individuals participating in the virtual reality simulation had similar knowledge retention and attitudes towards responding during an opioid-related overdose and administering intranasal naloxone when compared to individuals participating in hybrid simulation. The lack of significant findings between training groups indicates that the mobile virtual reality training is comparable to the in-person hybrid simulation for training nursing students to appropriately administer naloxone to reverse OOD and provide immediate recovery care after revival.

Abstract: The objective of this review was to collate and map gross anatomy curricular and pedagogical approaches for physiotherapy students. OBJECTIVE The objective of this review was to collate and map gross anatomy curricular and pedagogical approaches for physiotherapy students.Knowledge of anatomy is essential for physiotherapy clinical diagnosis, treatment effectiveness and safe practice. The information on this topic is sparse, and what does exist is diverse. This scoping review describes anatomy educational approaches for physiotherapy students and provides needed insight into this topic. INTRODUCTION Knowledge of anatomy is essential for physiotherapy clinical diagnosis, treatment effectiveness and safe practice. The information on this topic is sparse, and what does exist is diverse. This scoping review describes anatomy educational approaches for physiotherapy students and provides needed insight into this topic.No limits were applied on the date of the database search or age of participants. Languages were limited to English, French, German and Spanish. Studies had to include information on gross anatomy curricula or pedagogy for physiotherapy students, or information from qualified physiotherapists or those teaching gross anatomy to physiotherapy students. INCLUSION CRITERIA No limits were applied on the date of the database search or age of participants. Languages were limited to English, French, German and Spanish. Studies had to include information on gross anatomy curricula or pedagogy for physiotherapy students, or information from qualified physiotherapists or those teaching gross anatomy to physiotherapy students.Included studies were mainly sourced from EBSCOhost (CINAHL, ERIC and MEDLINE), PubMed and Scopus databases. Perusal of reference lists facilitated further retrievals. Studies published from inception up to 21 July 2019 were included. Studies were identified and screened, and the process was reported in a PRISMA flow diagram. JBI methodology for scoping reviews was followed. Selected studies were charted according to a template created and published in a JBI scoping review protocol. METHODS Included studies were mainly sourced from EBSCOhost (CINAHL, ERIC and MEDLINE), PubMed and Scopus databases. Perusal of reference lists facilitated further retrievals. Studies published from inception up to 21 July 2019 were included. Studies were identified and screened, and the process was reported in a PRISMA flow diagram. JBI methodology for scoping reviews was followed. Selected studies were charted according to a template created and published in a JBI scoping review protocol.Fifty-four studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Various studies gave calculable length of intervention in weeks (n=14, 26%), hours (n = 7, 13%) or both (n = 21, 39%). The majority of studies (n = 50, 93%) were cross-sectional studies; three were randomized controlled trials (6%). Mean sample sizes varied from 55.3 ± 30.4 (professional behaviors, ethical and humanistic aspects) to 323.2 ± 219.7 participants (multi-modal and blended learning). Overall, 29 studies (54%) included physiotherapy students or personnel in physiotherapy anatomy programs exclusively in the sample. Other disciplines with physiotherapy students included medical students (n = 12, 22%), and occupational therapy students (n = 10, 19%). The interprofessional education category (n = 8) determined that interdisciplinary teamwork led to increased anatomical learning and awareness of future clinical roles. Computer-assisted learning (n = 9) was effective as a stand-alone or adjunct pedagogy, useful for self-study and helped anatomical knowledge retention. Team-based learning (n = 2), peer teaching (n = 6) and clinical input incorporating case-based learning and horizontal and vertical integration (n = 4) resulted in anatomical knowledge retention and were associated with mastery of anatomical understanding, an increase in examination confidence and higher examination grades. Contradictory learning outcomes resulted from the use of online videos in blended and multi-model learning studies (n = 7). Increased student participation in asynchronous online discussion forums benefitted academic learning outcomes. The category of curriculum, pedagogy and materials (n = 15) identified and compared different survey results pertaining to the curricular aspect of the objectives of this review. One study investigated the flipped classroom concept. The use of anatomy content to encourage professional, ethical and humanistic aspects (n = 3) of physiotherapy students' behavior resulted in positive outcomes.

Abstract: Introduction Advances in the portability of ultrasound have allowed it to be increasingly employed at the point of care in austere settings. Battlefield constraints often limit the availability of medical officers throughout the operational environment, leading to increased interest in whether highly portable ultrasound devices can be employed by military medics to enhance their provision of combat casualty care. Data evaluating optimal training for effective medic employment of ultrasound is limited however. This prospective observational cohort study’s primary objective was to assess the impact of a 4-hour introductory training intervention on ultrasound-naïve military medic participants’ knowledge/performance of the eFAST application. Materials and Methods Conventional U.S. Army Medics, all naïve to ultrasound, were recruited from across JBLM. Volunteer participants underwent baseline eFAST knowledge assessment via a 50-question multiple-choice exam. Participants were then randomized to receive either conventional, expert-led classroom didactic training or didactic training via an online, asynchronously available platform. All participants then underwent expert-led, small group hands-on training and practice. Participants’ eFAST performance was then assessed with both live and phantom models, followed by a post-course knowledge exam. Concurrently, emergency medicine (EM) resident physician volunteers, serving as standard criterion for trained personnel, underwent the same OSCE assessments, followed by a written exam to assess their baseline eFAST knowledge. Primary outcome measures included (1) post-course knowledge improvement, (2) eFAST exam technical adequacy, and (3) eFAST exam OSCE score. Secondary outcome measures were time to exam completion and diagnostic accuracy rate for hemoperitoneum and hemopericardium. These outcome measures were then compared across medic cohorts and to those of the EM resident physician cohort. Results A total of 34 medics completed the study. After 4 hours of ultrasound training, overall eFAST knowledge among the 34 medics improved from a baseline mean of 27% on the pretest to 83% post-test. For eFAST exam performance, the medics scored an average of 20.8 out of a maximum of 22 points on the OSCE. There were no statistically significant differences between the medics who received asynchronous learning versus traditional classroom-based learning, and the medics demonstrated comparable performance to previously trained EM resident physicians. Conclusions A 4-hour introductory eFAST training intervention can effectively train conventional military medics to perform the eFAST exam. Online, asynchronously available platforms may effectively mitigate some of the resource requirement burden associated with point-of-care ultrasound training. Future studies evaluating medic eFAST performance on real-world battlefield trauma patients are needed. Skill and knowledge retention must also be assessed for this degradable skill to determine frequency of refresher training when not regularly performed.

Abstract: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to systematically review and synthesize the literature on organizational forgetting. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review approach was used to synthesize current theoretical and empirical studies on organizational forgetting. Findings The review and synthesis of the literature revealed that the organizational forgetting literature is fragmented, with studies conducted across disparate fields and using different methodologies; two primary modes (i.e. accidental and purposeful) and three foci (i.e. knowledge depreciation, knowledge loss and unlearning) define current organizational forgetting literature; and the factors that influence organizational forgetting can be grouped into four clusters related to individuals, processes, tools and organizational context. Research limitations/implications This literature review has limitations related to time span coverage and journal article accessibility. Originality/value This paper offers an integrative view of organizational forgetting that proposes a holistic and multilevel research approach and systematic synthesis of organizational forgetting research.

Abstract: Objective. To model the relationship of common pharmacy education assessment data including student demographics, pre-pharmacy performance, core didactic performance, and external testing measures to identify predictors of student readiness for advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPEs). Methods. The associations between 23 predictive covariates from 226 graduating students from 2015-2018 (5786 observations) and APPE readiness as measured by midpoint core APPE scores were modeled. Multiple linear and Poisson regression models with backward selection were used. A selection criterion of p >.10 was used for covariate elimination from the model. Three models were evaluated: average of all midpoint core APPE rotation scores; average of midpoint acute care pharmacy practice and ambulatory care APPE rotation scores; and number of midpoint core clerkship failing scores. Results. The average age of the population at admission was 25.4±4.5 years, 47% were female, and 75.2% had prior degrees. Across the three prediction models, knowledge-retention covariates were the strongest predictors. Total score on the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment was a modest yet consistent predictor across the models. All other significant predictors were unique to the various models. Conclusion. This four-year, population-based modeling study of the relationship of common pharmacy education assessment data to APPE midpoint scores shows a modest correlation with knowledge-based measures. There is a need for greater innovation in this area of research.Objective.

Abstract: As the oldest continuous living civilizations in the world, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have strength, tenacity, and resilience. Initial colonization of the landscape included violent dispossession and removal of people from Country to expand European land tenure and production systems, loss of knowledge holders through frontier violence, and formal government policies of segregation and assimilation designed to destroy ontological relationships with Country and kin. The ongoing manifestations of colonialism continue to affect food systems and food knowledges of Aboriginal peoples, and have led to severe health inequities and disproportionate rates of nutrition-related health conditions. There is an urgent need to collaborate with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to address nutrition and its underlying determinants in a way that integrates Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' understandings of food and food systems, health, healing, and well-being. We use the existing literature to discuss current ways that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are portrayed in the literature in relation to nutrition, identify knowledge gaps that require further research, and propose a new way forward.As the oldest continuous living civilizations in the world, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have strength, tenacity, and resilience.

Abstract: Introduction: Cases of anaphylaxis in children are often not appropriately managed by caregivers. We aimed to develop and to test the effectiveness of an education tool to help pediatric patients and their families better understand anaphylaxis and its management and to improve current knowledge and treatment guidelines adherence. Methods: The GEAR (Guidelines and Educational programs based on an Anaphylaxis Registry) is an initiative that recruits children with food-induced anaphylaxis who have visited the ED at the Montreal Children's Hospital and at The Children's Clinic located in Montreal, Quebec. The patients and parents, together, were asked to complete six questions related to the triggers, recognition and management of anaphylaxis at the time of presentation to the allergy clinic. Participants were automatically shown a 5-minute animated video addressing the main knowledge gaps related to the causes and management of anaphylaxis. At the end of the video, participants were redirected to same 6 questions to respond again. To test long-term knowledge retention, the questionnaire will be presented again in one year's time. A paired t-test was used to compare the difference between the baseline score and the follow-up score based on percentage of correct answers of the questionnaire. Results: From June to November 2019, 95 pediatric patients with diagnosed food-induced anaphylaxis were recruited. The median patient age was 4.5 years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 1.6–7.4) and half were male (51.6%). The mean questionnaire baseline score was 0.77 (77.0%, standard deviation (sd): 0.16) and the mean questionnaire follow-up score was 0.83 (83.0%, sd: 0.17). There was a significant difference between the follow-up score and baseline score (difference: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.09). There were no associations of baseline questionnaire scores and change in scores with age and sex. Conclusion: Our video teaching method was successful in educating patients and their families to better understand anaphylaxis. The next step is to acquire long-term follow up scored to determine retention of knowledge.

Abstract: Recently, there has been an increased volume of pedagogical research and practice of mobile learning (m‐learning) and gameplay in education. This paper presents the findings of a study that examined the effect on achievement and explored student perception towards quiz‐game play prior to an anatomy assessment in first year Higher Education students. Achievement data was collected over two academic years at all module assessment (A1–A4) points. A1 was used as a baseline, showing no difference between groups or years, A2 and A3 were comparable online assessments done on the lower and upper limbs that followed the same format; A4 was a viva–voce to assess the whole module learning. The optional 15‐minute quiz‐gameplay intervention (G) using a mobile application was initiated prior to A3, those students who chose not to participate performed their traditional study routine; no other changes to assessments were made resulting in a Gameplay and non‐gameplay (G, NG) group for each year. Students were invited to participate in an online focus group ( N  = 84) and a sample undertook in‐depth interviews ( N  = 9) to gain qualitative data on their perceptions of the intervention. Students who participated in the gameplay (G) group ( N  = 87) demonstrated a significant improvement in A3 compared to A2 , and the non‐game play (NG) group ( N  = 164) a significant decrease. A thematic analysis was undertaken on the focus group and interview data revealing key aspects of quiz‐gameplay as a learning tool. This paper offers insight into the potential benefit of encouraging m‐learning gameplay as part of revision or learning for anatomy students. This information could help educators and study support facilitate efficient revision methods as well as initiate further research into the use of anatomy gameplay to enhance the student learning experience. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic - Repeated and formative quizzing can help memory or knowledge retention. - Gameplay can help student engagement, learning and flow depending on the game in question. What this paper adds - Using mobile app‐based quiz‐games prior to an anatomy assessment can improve student achievement. - Students tend to play mobile app‐based quiz‐games whilst commuting on public transport, in their free time at home and at university. - Elements of mobile app‐based quiz‐games students identified as important are that they are interactive, allow competition, are visually appealing, provide instant feedback, are user friendly and are facilitated by the teacher. Implications for practice - Educators should encourage mobile app‐based quiz‐games to increase short‐term learning or revision. - Educators should facilitate mobile learning quiz‐game opportunities to encourage learning outside of the classroom. - Educators wanting to integrate mobile app‐based quiz‐games in their classes should use the game attributes identified in this study.

Abstract: This study was conducted to investigate if crossword puzzles as active learning tools can improve the knowledge retention of nursing students in pharmacology of epilepsy and improve their performance in writing the correct spelling of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to investigate if crossword puzzles as active learning tools can improve the knowledge retention of nursing students in pharmacology of epilepsy and improve their performance in writing the correct spelling of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).The present study was a randomized controlled prospective parallel study in which a control group design with pretests and posttests were used among nursing students. Students were randomly allocated to either control group (n = 114) who received routine learning or intervention group (n = 110) who received crossword puzzles. Both control and intervention groups had to complete multiple-choice question (MCQs) and spelling pretests and posttests. METHODS The present study was a randomized controlled prospective parallel study in which a control group design with pretests and posttests were used among nursing students. Students were randomly allocated to either control group (n = 114) who received routine learning or intervention group (n = 110) who received crossword puzzles. Both control and intervention groups had to complete multiple-choice question (MCQs) and spelling pretests and posttests.Scores of the MCQs and spelling pretests were not statistically different (p-value > 0.05) for participants in all achievement categories in both control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, scores in the first and second MCQs and spelling posttests were significantly higher than their corresponding scores in the pretest scores for participants from the all achievement categories (p-value   0.05). Data analyses showed that there were significant normalized changes between scores of students in across all achievement categories. RESULTS Scores of the MCQs and spelling pretests were not statistically different (p-value > 0.05) for participants in all achievement categories in both control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, scores in the first and second MCQs and spelling posttests were significantly higher than their corresponding scores in the pretest scores for participants from the all achievement categories (p-value   0.05). Data analyses showed that there were significant normalized changes between scores of students in across all achievement categories.Findings of this study suggested that crossword puzzles were effective in improving the learning of nursing students about the pharmacology of epilepsy and writing correct spelling of AEDs. Educators should consider using crossword puzzles as active learning tools to improve knowledge of nursing students about the pharmacology of epilepsy. CONCLUSION Findings of this study suggested that crossword puzzles were effective in improving the learning of nursing students about the pharmacology of epilepsy and writing correct spelling of AEDs. Educators should consider using crossword puzzles as active learning tools to improve knowledge of nursing students about the pharmacology of epilepsy.

Abstract: A multimodal nursing pedagogy utilizing simulation was incorporated into annual nurse competencies at a 465-bed academic medical center to translate into practice the required surveillance of a potentially septic patient and the necessary clinical decision-making. Pretest/posttest was used to determine knowledge retention from simulation. Nurses' sepsis knowledge following simulation was improved. Simulation can provide long-term knowledge retention of sepsis for application into clinical practice and be a viable option for competency assessment for professional nurses.A multimodal nursing pedagogy utilizing simulation was incorporated into annual nurse competencies at a 465-bed academic medical center to translate into practice the required surveillance of a potentially septic patient and the necessary clinical decision-making.

Abstract: In the midst of the international opioid-related overdose (OOD) crisis, appropriate naloxone training is needed by both healthcare professionals and community members to better leverage its life-saving potential. BACKGROUND In the midst of the international opioid-related overdose (OOD) crisis, appropriate naloxone training is needed by both healthcare professionals and community members to better leverage its life-saving potential.Pilot the use of a virtual reality simulation for training student nurses to identify signs and symptoms of an OOD, properly administer intranasal naloxone, and provide immediate recovery care after revival. OBJECTIVE Pilot the use of a virtual reality simulation for training student nurses to identify signs and symptoms of an OOD, properly administer intranasal naloxone, and provide immediate recovery care after revival.This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study evaluated knowledge and attitudes towards intervening during an opioid-related overdose among student nurses before and after participating in a traditional hybrid simulation or virtual reality simulation. DESIGN This quasi-experimental pretest-posttest study evaluated knowledge and attitudes towards intervening during an opioid-related overdose among student nurses before and after participating in a traditional hybrid simulation or virtual reality simulation.A medium sized urban university's school of nursing in the Northeastern United States. SETTING A medium sized urban university's school of nursing in the Northeastern United States.Fifty (N = 50) senior Bachelor of Nursing Science (BSN) students. PARTICIPANTS Fifty (N = 50) senior Bachelor of Nursing Science (BSN) students.Knowledge and attitudes were assessed using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS). Students completed measures 3 weeks prior to training and 3 weeks after. Appropriate t-tests evaluated changes in OOAS and OOKS scores both within and between training groups (e.g. hybrid simulation compared to virtual reality). METHODS Knowledge and attitudes were assessed using the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS) and Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS). Students completed measures 3 weeks prior to training and 3 weeks after. Appropriate t-tests evaluated changes in OOAS and OOKS scores both within and between training groups (e.g. hybrid simulation compared to virtual reality).Sample characteristics were well balanced in both the hybrid simulation group (n = 31) and virtual reality group (n = 19). There were no statistically significant differences in average OOKS and OOAS scores at baseline or at follow up between those receiving hybrid simulation or the virtual reality training. All participants' attitudes scores decreased from baseline to follow up by <2 points. However, there was no difference in the change in knowledge scores between the training groups. RESULTS Sample characteristics were well balanced in both the hybrid simulation group (n = 31) and virtual reality group (n = 19). There were no statistically significant differences in average OOKS and OOAS scores at baseline or at follow up between those receiving hybrid simulation or the virtual reality training. All participants' attitudes scores decreased from baseline to follow up by <2 points. However, there was no difference in the change in knowledge scores between the training groups.Individuals participating in the virtual reality simulation had similar knowledge retention and attitudes towards responding during an opioid-related overdose and administering intranasal naloxone when compared to individuals participating in hybrid simulation. The lack of significant findings between training groups indicates that the mobile virtual reality training is comparable to the in-person hybrid simulation for training nursing students to appropriately administer naloxone to reverse OOD and provide immediate recovery care after revival. CONCLUSIONS Individuals participating in the virtual reality simulation had similar knowledge retention and attitudes towards responding during an opioid-related overdose and administering intranasal naloxone when compared to individuals participating in hybrid simulation. The lack of significant findings between training groups indicates that the mobile virtual reality training is comparable to the in-person hybrid simulation for training nursing students to appropriately administer naloxone to reverse OOD and provide immediate recovery care after revival.

Abstract: Coach and parent concussion education programs are essential for the prevention, diagnosis, management, and return to play of youth athletes. This systematic review examined the content and efficacy (changes in knowledge, impact on concussion incidence) of concussion education programs for coaches and parents of youth and high school athletes. Six databases were searched: SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Premiere, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Studies evaluated the use and/or efficacy of concussion education programs among coaches or parents of youth athletes. A total of 13 articles (out of 1553 articles) met selection criteria. Although different concussion education programs exist, only three have been evaluated in the literature: ACTive Athletic Concussion Training™, USA Football's Heads Up Football, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's HEADS UP. These programs are well liked among coaches and parents and the suggested practices are easily implemented by coaches. These programs increased concussion knowledge among coaches and parents and promoted behavioral changes among coaches to reduce the concussion risk in high school sports. Few studies have assessed the efficacy of concussion education programs on youth athlete health outcomes. No studies included a longitudinal follow up to determine the degree of knowledge retention following the intervention. While online educational programs are sufficient to improve coach knowledge, in-person training may be a more effective educational tool for reducing the incidence of youth sport concussion. Future studies addressing the efficacy of concussion education programs should include a longitudinal follow up to assess knowledge retention and fidelity.Coach and parent concussion education programs are essential for the prevention, diagnosis, management, and return to play of youth athletes.

Questions concerning attention and Stiegler’s therapeutics

Abstract: The article sets out to develop the concept of attention as a key aspect to building the possible therapeutics that Bernard Stiegler’s recent works have pointed to ( The Automatic Society , 2016, The Neganthropocene , 2018 and Qu’appelle-t-on Panser, 2018). The therapeutic aspect of pharmacology takes place through processes that are neganthropic; therefore, which attempt to counteract the entropic nature of digital technologies where there is flattening out to the measurable and the calculable of Big Data. The most obvious examples of this flattening out can be seen in relation to the use of natural language processing technologies for text interpretation and the use of text analytics alongside student analytics. However, the process of exosomatisation of knowledge takes place in forms of hypomnesic tertiary retentions or digital technologies. The loss of knowledge is inherent to these processes of exteriorisation, this loss of knowledge takes place through a process proletarianisation which Marx had pointed to in the Grundisse (1939). The therapeutic gesture is, therefore, an intrinsically educational one, where the loss of knowledge of the pharmacological nature of digital technologies is counteracted by other forms of knowledge construction that can be enabled by digital technologies. Hence, there is a profound educational gesture necessary to enable the re-harnessing of technology to enable the therapeutics. This paper will argue that the positive re-harnessing, the therapeutics, can take place through the development of new forms of neganthropic gestures which can be afforded by the development of specific forms of digital technologies. These also enable a contributive research process whereby the rationalisation of the production of knowledge within the university can be challenged by collaborative, interpretative processes of knowledge production.

Abstract: The study aims to evaluate and see if experiential learning theory for teaching cataract surgery can improve the ability of students to retain more knowledge compared to the classical or traditional way of teaching. PURPOSE The study aims to evaluate and see if experiential learning theory for teaching cataract surgery can improve the ability of students to retain more knowledge compared to the classical or traditional way of teaching.A pre and post control group design of 32 graduates was conducted in 2016 at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to examine the effect of experiential learning as an applicable way for teaching cataract surgery. The total of graduates including males and females were divided into control and experimental groups to which the educational materials about cataract surgery were presented as a lecture and as wet lab session respectively. All the data collected were entered in SPSS version 22 for analysis and a P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. METHODS A pre and post control group design of 32 graduates was conducted in 2016 at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to examine the effect of experiential learning as an applicable way for teaching cataract surgery. The total of graduates including males and females were divided into control and experimental groups to which the educational materials about cataract surgery were presented as a lecture and as wet lab session respectively. All the data collected were entered in SPSS version 22 for analysis and a P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.Both control and experimental groups showed good retention rate of knowledge. However, the gain of knowledge was more in the Wet lab group. The scores mean increased more than 5 points in this group compared to 2.5 points only in the lecture groups. RESULTS Both control and experimental groups showed good retention rate of knowledge. However, the gain of knowledge was more in the Wet lab group. The scores mean increased more than 5 points in this group compared to 2.5 points only in the lecture groups.Both teaching modalities were effective in improving the knowledge rate of the students. However, in the experiential learning group (Wet lab group), the gain of knowledge was higher compared to that in the traditional group (lecture group). CONCLUSION Both teaching modalities were effective in improving the knowledge rate of the students. However, in the experiential learning group (Wet lab group), the gain of knowledge was higher compared to that in the traditional group (lecture group).

Abstract: Background: Continuing education is crucial for healthcare professionals to keep up with research but attending classroom lectures is a major barrier. Chronic wound management is increasingly relevant for continuous professional training. Digital education offers learning tailored to individual needs and could be an effective alternative to healthcare professionals’ training. However, the effectiveness of digital education for chronic wound management training has not been explored. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of digital education in improving healthcare professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, practical skills and behaviour change on chronic wound management, and their satisfaction with the intervention. Design: This systematic review follows Cochrane methodology and is one of a series of reviews on the use of digital education for health professions education. Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42018109971 Data sources: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database. Review methods: We included randomised control trials, cluster randomised control trials and quasi-randomised control trials comparing digital or blended education with traditional learning, no intervention or other forms of digital or blended education for pre- or post-registration healthcare professionals in chronic wound management. A narrative summary of findings is presented. Results: Seven studies (1,404 participants) were included. All studies investigated interventions for nursing students or professionals working in hospitals or community settings, and all but one study focused on pressure ulcers. Five studies (935 participants) assessed post-intervention knowledge, and indicated that digital education was more effective than no intervention, while blended learning was superior to exclusive digital education. Three studies (543 participants) assessed post-intervention skills and reported mixed results. One study (140 participants) compared post-intervention behaviour change and satisfaction with blended and online digital education, and reported no difference in behaviour between the groups, and higher satisfaction with blended education. For knowledge retention up to six months, digital education was more effective than no intervention, while blended learning was superior to digital education. The risk of bias in included studies was mostly high or unclear. Conclusions: Digital education on chronic wound management appears to be less effective than blended education and more effective than no intervention in improving knowledge among nurses and nursing students. Data for other outcomes is scarce and inconclusive. Future studies should assess participants’ skills, attitudes, satisfaction and behaviour change; cost-effectiveness and potential untoward effects of digital education, compare digital education to other learning modalities and include other healthcare professionals in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Background: Continuing education is crucial for healthcare professionals to keep up with research but attending classroom lectures is a major barrier. Chronic wound management is increasingly relevant for continuous professional training. Digital education offers learning tailored to individual needs and could be an effective alternative to healthcare professionals' training. However, the effectiveness of digital education for chronic wound management training has not been explored. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of digital education in improving healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, practical skills and behaviour change on chronic wound management, and their satisfaction with the intervention. Design: This systematic review follows Cochrane methodology and is one of a series of reviews on the use of digital education for health professions education. Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42018109971 Dota sources: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC, PsyclNFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database. Review methods: We included randomised control trials, cluster randomised control trials and quasi-randomised control trials comparing digital or blended education with traditional learning, no intervention or other forms of digital or blended education for pre- or post-registration healthcare professionals in chronic wound management. A narrative summary of findings is presented. Results: Seven studies (1,404 participants) were included. All studies investigated interventions for nursing students or professionals working in hospitals or community settings, and all but one study focused on pressure ulcers. Five studies (935 participants) assessed post-intervention knowledge, and indicated that digital education was more effective than no intervention, while blended learning was superior to exclusive digital education. Three studies (543 participants) assessed post-intervention skills and reported mixed results. One study (140 participants) compared post-intervention behaviour change and satisfaction with blended and online digital education, and reported no difference in behaviour between the groups, and higher satisfaction with blended education. For knowledge retention up to six months, digital education was more effective than no intervention, while blended learning was superior to digital education. The risk of bias in included studies was mostly high or unclear. Conclusions: Digital education on chronic wound management appears to be less effective than blended education and more effective than no intervention in improving knowledge among nurses and nursing students. Data for other outcomes is scarce and inconclusive. Future studies should assess participants' skills, attitudes, satisfaction and behaviour change; cost-effectiveness and potential untoward effects of digital education, compare digital education to other learning modalities and include other healthcare professionals in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: Traditional conference didactics may not be effectively meeting the learning needs of today's emergency medicine (EM) residents, and educators are employing various interactive approaches to engage learners. Escape Room is a popular adventure game in which participants must work together to solve a series of puzzles to escape a locked room. Our aim was to adapt this game design to teach core EM content and procedural aptitude. Upon entering the "locked" room residents were faced with a series of puzzles involving concepts such as toxicology antidotes, ventilator management, echocardiogram interpretations, airway foreign body removal, arterial line transducer setup, and using a cast cutter. Using teamwork and limited clues learners had to work together to "escape" the room. Afterward, a didactic summary was given to enhance knowledge retention. The Escape Room construct was successfully adopted as an engaging model to teach EM core content and procedure skills while simultaneously fostering team building. Feedback received was overwhelmingly positive. This unique alternative educational activity can be easily implemented at any EM residency program as an effective alternative educational tool.Traditional conference didactics may not be effectively meeting the learning needs of today's emergency medicine (EM) residents, and educators are employing various interactive approaches to engage learners.

Abstract: The objective was to assess the feasibility of using spaced multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to teach residents during their pediatric emergency department (PED) rotation and determine whether this teaching improves knowledge retention about pediatric rashes. OBJECTIVES The objective was to assess the feasibility of using spaced multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to teach residents during their pediatric emergency department (PED) rotation and determine whether this teaching improves knowledge retention about pediatric rashes.Residents rotating in the PED from four sites were randomized to four groups: pretest and intervention, pretest and no intervention, no pretest and intervention, and no pretest and no intervention. Residents in intervention groups were automatically e-mailed quizlets with two MCQs every other day over 4 weeks (20 questions total) via an automated e-mail service with answers e-mailed 2 days later. Retention of knowledge was assessed 70 days after enrollment with a posttest of 20 unique, content-matched questions. METHODS Residents rotating in the PED from four sites were randomized to four groups: pretest and intervention, pretest and no intervention, no pretest and intervention, and no pretest and no intervention. Residents in intervention groups were automatically e-mailed quizlets with two MCQs every other day over 4 weeks (20 questions total) via an automated e-mail service with answers e-mailed 2 days later. Retention of knowledge was assessed 70 days after enrollment with a posttest of 20 unique, content-matched questions.Between August 2015 and November 2016, a total 234 residents were enrolled. The completion rate of individual quizlets ranged from 93% on the first and 76% on the 10th quizlet. Sixty-six residents (55%) completed all 10 quizlets. One-hundred seventy-three residents (74%) completed the posttest. There was no difference in posttest scores between residents who received a pretest (61.0% ± 14.5%) and those who did not (64.6% ± 14.0%; mean difference = -3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -8.0 to 0. 6) nor between residents who received the intervention (64.5% ± 13.3%) and those who did not receive the intervention (61.2% ± 15.2%; mean difference = 3.2, 95% CI = -1.1 to 7.5). For those who received a pretest, scores improved from the pretest to the posttest (46.4% vs. 60.1%, respectively; 95% CI = 9.7 to 19.5). RESULTS Between August 2015 and November 2016, a total 234 residents were enrolled. The completion rate of individual quizlets ranged from 93% on the first and 76% on the 10th quizlet. Sixty-six residents (55%) completed all 10 quizlets. One-hundred seventy-three residents (74%) completed the posttest. There was no difference in posttest scores between residents who received a pretest (61.0% ± 14.5%) and those who did not (64.6% ± 14.0%; mean difference = -3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -8.0 to 0. 6) nor between residents who received the intervention (64.5% ± 13.3%) and those who did not receive the intervention (61.2% ± 15.2%; mean difference = 3.2, 95% CI = -1.1 to 7.5). For those who received a pretest, scores improved from the pretest to the posttest (46.4% vs. 60.1%, respectively; 95% CI = 9.7 to 19.5).Providing spaced MCQs every other day to residents rotating through the PED is a feasible teaching tool with a high participation rate. There was no difference in posttest scores regardless of pretest or intervention. Repeated exposure to the same MCQs and an increase in the number of questions sent to residents may increase the impact of this educational strategy. CONCLUSION Providing spaced MCQs every other day to residents rotating through the PED is a feasible teaching tool with a high participation rate. There was no difference in posttest scores regardless of pretest or intervention. Repeated exposure to the same MCQs and an increase in the number of questions sent to residents may increase the impact of this educational strategy.

Abstract: Continuing education (CE) can help public health professionals maintain and further develop their knowledge and skills to adapt to the changing public health landscape. This scoping review aims to identify the preferred modalities for delivering CE to public health professionals and to determine how equity has been incorporated into public health training. INTRODUCTION Continuing education (CE) can help public health professionals maintain and further develop their knowledge and skills to adapt to the changing public health landscape. This scoping review aims to identify the preferred modalities for delivering CE to public health professionals and to determine how equity has been incorporated into public health training.Using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews as a guide, we searched four databases for peer-reviewed primary research studies that evaluated public health workforce CE modalities. METHODS Using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews as a guide, we searched four databases for peer-reviewed primary research studies that evaluated public health workforce CE modalities.The review included 33 studies published between 1 January 2000 and 6 August 2019 from over 11 countries. Most articles broadly described their training audience as public health professionals employed by government or non-governmental organizations. Delivery methods included online, in-person or blended learning (combining online and in-person instruction). Learners strongly preferred self-directed approaches. Organizational support, including protected time for professional development during work hours, was an important enabler of training completion. Commonly cited barriers included course duration and a high number of contact hours. RESULTS The review included 33 studies published between 1 January 2000 and 6 August 2019 from over 11 countries.

Commonly cited barriers included course duration and a high number of contact hours.Findings suggest that there is no single preferred training modality. We identified three elements that influence modality preference: design, delivery and organizational support. Modality should be determined by participants' location, needs and previous experiences to ensure the content is relevant and delivered in a way that equips learners to apply the knowledge gained.

Abstract: Continuing education is crucial for healthcare professionals to keep up with research but attending classroom lectures is a major barrier. Chronic wound management is increasingly relevant for continuous professional training. Digital education offers learning tailored to individual needs and could be an effective alternative to healthcare professionals' training. However, the effectiveness of digital education for chronic wound management training has not been explored. BACKGROUND Continuing education is crucial for healthcare professionals to keep up with research but attending classroom lectures is a major barrier. Chronic wound management is increasingly relevant for continuous professional training. Digital education offers learning tailored to individual needs and could be an effective alternative to healthcare professionals' training. However, the effectiveness of digital education for chronic wound management training has not been explored.To assess the effectiveness of digital education in improving healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, practical skills and behaviour change on chronic wound management, and their satisfaction with the intervention. OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of digital education in improving healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitudes, practical skills and behaviour change on chronic wound management, and their satisfaction with the intervention.This systematic review follows Cochrane methodology and is one of a series of reviews on the use of digital education for health professions education. Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42018109971 DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database. DESIGN This systematic review follows Cochrane methodology and is one of a series of reviews on the use of digital education for health professions education. Protocol registration: PROSPERO CRD42018109971 DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and ProQuest Dissertation and Theses Database.We included randomised control trials, cluster randomised control trials and quasi-randomised control trials comparing digital or blended education with traditional learning, no intervention or other forms of digital or blended education for pre- or post-registration healthcare professionals in chronic wound management. A narrative summary of findings is presented. REVIEW METHODS We included randomised control trials, cluster randomised control trials and quasi-randomised control trials comparing digital or blended education with traditional learning, no intervention or other forms of digital or blended education for pre- or post-registration healthcare professionals in chronic wound management. A narrative summary of findings is presented.Seven studies (1,404 participants) were included. All studies investigated interventions for nursing students or professionals working in hospitals or community settings, and all but one study focused on pressure ulcers. Five studies (935 participants) assessed post-intervention knowledge, and indicated that digital education was more effective than no intervention, while blended learning was superior to exclusive digital education. Three studies (543 participants) assessed post-intervention skills and reported mixed results. One study (140 participants) compared post-intervention behaviour change and satisfaction with blended and online digital education, and reported no difference in behaviour between the groups, and higher satisfaction with blended education. For knowledge retention up to six months, digital education was more effective than no intervention, while blended learning was superior to digital education. The risk of bias in included studies was mostly high or unclear. RESULTS Seven studies (1,404 participants) were included.

Data for other outcomes is scarce and inconclusive. Future studies should assess participants' skills, attitudes, satisfaction and behaviour change; cost-effectiveness and potential untoward effects of digital education, compare digital education to other learning modalities and include other healthcare professionals in diverse clinical settings.

Abstract: For hundreds of years, magic tricks have been employed within a variety of pedagogic contexts, including promoting science and mathematics, delivering educational messaging, enhancing scepticism about the paranormal, and boosting creative thinking for product design. This review examines this diverse body of work, focusing on studies that have assessed the impact of such interventions. Although the studies tended to yield positive outcomes, much of the work suffered from methodological shortcomings, including measuring the impact of interventions over a relatively short period of time, focusing on self-report measures and failing to employ control groups. The paper makes several recommendations for future study in the area, including assessing the longer-term impact of magic-based interventions, comparing these interventions to other types of pedagogic techniques, focussing on knowledge retention and behavioural outcomes, and collaborating with magicians to develop more impactful interventions.

Abstract: With the movement away from lectures and towards active learning sessions, medical school faculty must choose a format that fits the learning objectives and is achievable with available resources. Small groups bring organizational challenges including additional faculty and classrooms. Large groups are an opportunity to conduct case-based active learning exercises with fewer faculty. Our study compares the learning effectiveness of an active learning session on metabolic liver disease conducted in both the small group and large group formats. BACKGROUND With the movement away from lectures and towards active learning sessions, medical school faculty must choose a format that fits the learning objectives and is achievable with available resources. Small groups bring organizational challenges including additional faculty and classrooms. Large groups are an opportunity to conduct case-based active learning exercises with fewer faculty. Our study compares the learning effectiveness of an active learning session on metabolic liver disease conducted in both the small group and large group formats.All MS1 students at University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine (LCOM) ( n  = 120) were randomized to participate in either the small or large group session. The same pre-learning videos and computer-based active learning module were used for all students in both session types. A post-session questionnaire was administered, and student exam performance was analyzed to evaluate each session type on the following criteria: (1) student preparedness for the session, (2) student perceptions of the session's learning effectiveness, (3) learner knowledge upon completion of the session, and (4) knowledge retention at 10 days.

Students assigned to the large group did choose their collaborators differently than those in the small group, tending more often to work with their friends. RESULTS No statistically significant differences were found between the large and small group cohorts on student perceptions of learning effectiveness or knowledge assessment, both immediate and delayed. Students assigned to the large group did choose their collaborators differently than those in the small group, tending more often to work with their friends.When organized well, a large group active learning format may be used in place of a small group without diminishing the learning effectiveness of the activity. CONCLUSION When organized well, a large group active learning format may be used in place of a small group without diminishing the learning effectiveness of the activity.

Abstract: Human anatomy is a foundational course in nursing education, however, there is growing concern that students do not retain enough anatomical knowledge to successfully apply it in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to determine retention level of anatomy knowledge among second‐year nursing students from their first‐year anatomy class, and to determine if there is a difference in level of retention based on organ system. For each system, second‐year students were asked to answer 9 to 11 multiple‐choice questions (MCQs), and the scores from these quizzes were compared to matched test items from their first‐year anatomy examinations. There was a significant decrease in the overall mean score from 83.05 ± 8.34 (± SD) in first year to 54.36 ±12.9 in second year ( P = 0.0001). Retention levels were system specific. System‐specific knowledge retention was highest for the gastrointestinal system (89.7%), respiratory system (88.5%), and genitourinary system (83.6%). This was followed by the integumentary system (80.1%), special senses (79.4%), nervous system (74.9%), and musculoskeletal system (69.3%). Retention was lowest for the lymphatic system (64.3%), cranial nerves (58.8%), vascular system (53.9%), and head and neck (42.6%). The present study shows that nursing students’ anatomy knowledge retention was comparatively higher than rates reported by others in medical and allied‐health students. The researchers are now investigating knowledge retention in third‐ and fourth‐year nursing students. Further investigation into why retention is higher for specific systems and intervention strategies to improve knowledge acquisition and retention in nursing students is recommended.

Abstract: Attrition of anatomy knowledge has been an area of concern in health professions curricula. To ensure safe and effective clinical practice, the study of chiropractic requires a good knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. In this study, musculoskeletal limb knowledge retention was investigated among students in the 5‐year chiropractic program at Macquarie University, Australia. A test of 20 multiple‐choice questions, categorized into low‐order (LO) and high‐order (HO) cognitive ability according to Bloom’s Taxonomy, was developed. Students enrolled in the program were invited to participate with 257 of the 387 choosing to participate, (response rate ranging 56%–72% per year level). No attrition of knowledge across the years was observed, instead, a significant increase in knowledge, measured by total LO and HO scores ( P < 0.0005), throughout the program. There were significant increases in both low and high cognitive scores which were not uniform, with high‐order scores increasing significantly in the last two year levels. The increase of knowledge, may be explained, at least partially, by the vertical and horizontal integrated curriculum. Retrieval of knowledge, especially in clinically applied formats, may have led to an enhanced ability to apply anatomy knowledge and account for the increased scores in the high‐order knowledge seen in the later clinical years. Evaluating anatomy knowledge retention at different cognitive levels seems to provide a better assessment and is worth considering in future anatomy educational research.

Abstract: ENG English ENG Traditional medicinal plants play a central role in primary health care in most African communities, including that of the Maasai. Unfortunately, the local Maasai knowledge is under enormous pressure from introduction of agriculture, population growth, and climate change—all of which affect availability and regeneration of natural resources and ecosystem services which are accompanied by erosion of traditional knowledge. Loss of medicinal plants and the knowledge related to them would have devastating effects on the Maasai community. Therefore, it is important to document the plants and the traditional knowledge related to their use, and conservation and management. We interviewed 31 informants who were especially knowledgeable about medicinal plants. Based on these interviews, we document 62 plant species that the Loita Maasai use as medicine, and we describe the parts of the plant that are used, the methods of preparation, and how they are used. We rank them according to their importance to the people and discuss the management practices developed for these resources, and we evaluate the conservation status.

Abstract: The LIS educators need adequate and accurate knowledge of information to enhance effectiveness as well as productiveness of their teaching profession, most especially as a result of the emergence of ICT in library and information studies. In line with this, knowledge sharing practice for knowledge retention and growth was investigated among the LIS educators in Akanu Ibiam Federal Polytechnic Ebonyi State. Simple random sampling technique was used to select 32 respondents who represented the sample size for the study. Data was obtained through the use of a structured questionnaire. Frequency counts, percentages, means, standard deviations and PPMC were used for data analysis. Findings revealed that 68.8% of the respondents were male and 31.3% female, 59.4% were Senior Lecturers and 65.6% were between ages 40 to 49 years. Majority (87.5%) of the respondents shared professional knowledge and exchange research knowledge and out-put, while 78.2% shared knowledge for career development. On the other hand 100%, 90.6% and 59.4% were not sharing knowledge relating to family issues, experiences, method of teaching and ICT related issues. However, 100% of the respondents realised the importance of knowledge sharing in their department as they shared knowledge during departmental meetings, seminars, workshops, interpersonal interaction and also encouraged their students to share knowledge among themselves. Sharing knowledge with colleagues improved knowledge retention of the respondents (93.8%), and Knowledge sharing built their assimilation skills (78.2%). Furthermore, 87.5% of the respondents were able to apply the knowledge gained from interaction with their colleagues to their professional routine. This built the growth of their information acquisition, confidence and ability to withstand educational related activities, including the respondents' productivities in teaching and research output (68.7%). Disinterest to get engaged in debate sessions about the specialized fields of Library and Information Science (68.8%) and lacked of cooperation among the faculty members, dissimilarity of the level of knowledge and experience between the faculty members (62.5%) is affecting their knowledge sharing practice. PPMC revealed that knowledge sharing significantly (p<0.05) influence knowledge retention and knowledge growth. The study concluded that knowledge sharing influence knowledge retention and knowledge growth. It was recommended that the LIS educators should improve their knowledge sharing in the areas of experiences, method of teaching and ICT related issues.

Abstract: This paper focuses on immersive learning in a composition-centered curriculum in K–5 general music education. It is one aspect of a 4-year longitudinal study of children's musical development through composition. I collected data over 4 years on the work of students (N=300) who attended music classes as part of their general education. Data comprised video and audio recordings of student performances of and interviews about their compositional processes; photographs of student written work and of classroom activity; students' written and drawn scores, notated scores, and other drawings; researcher written work, lesson plans, and observational notes of classroom activity. I transcribed and analyzed student compositions for theoretical constructs, analyzing scores alongside performances to determine musical connections. Spectrographic analysis provided deeper understanding of student work. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of one student's work over 4 years as a representative example of how the immersive learning environment influenced musical development. Results show that the immersive learning environment (a) was effective in furthering musical skill development, which grew beyond grade level expectations for each year; (b) allowed for musical ideas to grow in complexity given time and space to develop; and (c) aided skills and knowledge retention, which positively influenced musicianship development.

Abstract: Background The specialist palliative care workforce is experiencing recruitment and retention challenges to Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) roles in all settings. In response, drawing on the End of Life Care Learning Outcomes (LO) (Taylor 2016), the Yorkshire CNS Workforce Group created a supra-regional CNS development programme (Dec 2019-July 2020) supported by HEE funding. Twenty two participants across thirteen sites are supported by a local mentor to: - develop individual workplace development programmes using the LOs - receive support/on–going education - record evidence of achievement in the LO document. Project aims: - sharing and delivery of education resources to multiple participants - formation of a community–of–practice for CNSs’/mentors - implementation of LOs using bespoke documentation, enabling regional benchmarking of CNS competence - development of e–portfolio enabling ‘pass–porting’ between organisations (hosted on HEE Website) - improve CNS confidence/knowledge/retention Method Utilising the ECHO tele-education model, 6 interactive education sessions (presentation and case based discussion) will be live-streamed to participants in their place of work. Participants should participate in a minimum of 5 sessions. A participant focus group identified topics, ensuring relevant, practice-related learning. Participants and mentors implement individual workplace development programmes. Evaluation To evaluate impact on knowledge, confidence, staff retention. Completion of self-evaluation in relation to Learning Outcomes using Bondy Self-Assessment tool at beginning, during and end of project. Completion of validated Self-efficacy questionnaire pre and post course. Immediate evaluation using ECHO technology after each taught session (Likert scale). Comparative recruitment data analysis at end of project Results Initial Feedback after first session, all 20 participants agree or strongly agree that: • Participation increased knowledge and confidence • They felt connected to other participants • Topic was relevant to practice and LO This innovative, collaborative project brings new CNSs together across a region and beyond, learning and developing together in a virtual cohort, to build confidence and knowledge.

Abstract: Andragogy, the art and science of helping adults learn, is a learner-centric conceptual framework that considers adult learner characteristics and their motivations for learning. These motivations range from internal will, readiness to learn, and relevance to one's own life. The flipped classroom, an increasingly popular educational method for both learners and educators, aligns with an andragogical approach as it uses classroom time for application of knowledge and critical thinking rather than for a passive didactic lecture. The growing body of educational research demonstrating increased performance and knowledge retention using this method has led to its incorporation into graduate medical education materials, including the National Neonatology Curriculum.

These motivations range from internal will, readiness to learn, and relevance to one's own life. The flipped classroom, an increasingly popular educational method for both learners and educators, aligns with an andragogical approach as it uses classroom time for application of knowledge and critical thinking rather than for a passive didactic lecture. The growing body of educational research demonstrating increased performance and knowledge retention using this method has led to its incorporation into graduate medical education materials, including the National Neonatology Curriculum. In this article, the authors review how the flipped classroom, an active educational method that embraces the tenets of adult learning theory, may be more effective in graduate medical education compared with traditional lecture.

Abstract: Human anatomy is a foundational course in nursing education, however, there is growing concern that students do not retain enough anatomical knowledge to successfully apply it in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to determine retention level of anatomy knowledge among second‐year nursing students from their first‐year anatomy class, and to determine if there is a difference in level of retention based on organ system. For each system, second‐year students were asked to answer 9 to 11 multiple‐choice questions (MCQs), and the scores from these quizzes were compared to matched test items from their first‐year anatomy examinations. There was a significant decrease in the overall mean score from 83.05 ± 8.34 (±SD) in first year to 54.36 ±12.9 in second year ( P = 0.0001). Retention levels were system specific. System‐specific knowledge retention was highest for the gastrointestinal system (89.7%), respiratory system (88.5%), and genitourinary system (83.6%). This was followed by the integumentary system (80.1%), special senses (79.4%), nervous system (74.9%), and musculoskeletal system (69.3%). Retention was lowest for the lymphatic system (64.3%), cranial nerves (58.8%), vascular system (53.9%), and head and neck (42.6%). The present study shows that nursing students’ anatomy knowledge retention was comparatively higher than rates reported by others in medical and allied‐health students. The researchers are now investigating knowledge retention in third‐ and fourth‐year nursing students. Further investigation into why retention is higher for specific systems and intervention strategies to improve knowledge acquisition and retention in nursing students is recommended.

Musculoskeletal Anatomy Knowledge Retention in the Macquarie University Chiropractic Program: A Cross‐Sectional Study

Abstract: Attrition of anatomy knowledge has been an area of concern in health professions curricula. To ensure safe and effective clinical practice, the study of chiropractic requires a good knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. In this study, musculoskeletal limb knowledge retention was investigated among students in the 5‐year chiropractic program at Macquarie University, Australia. A test of 20 multiple‐choice questions, categorized into low‐order (LO) and high‐order (HO) cognitive ability according to Bloom’s Taxonomy, was developed. Students enrolled in the program were invited to participate with 257 of the 387 choosing to participate, (response rate ranging 56%–72% per year level). No attrition of knowledge across the years was observed, instead, a significant increase in knowledge, measured by total LO and HO scores ( P  < 0.0005), throughout the program. There were significant increases in both low and high cognitive scores which were not uniform, with high‐order scores increasing significantly in the last two year levels. The increase of knowledge, may be explained, at least partially, by the vertical and horizontal integrated curriculum. Retrieval of knowledge, especially in clinically applied formats, may have led to an enhanced ability to apply anatomy knowledge and account for the increased scores in the high‐order knowledge seen in the later clinical years. Evaluating anatomy knowledge retention at different cognitive levels seems to provide a better assessment and is worth considering in future anatomy educational research.

Abstract: Open‐source software (OSS) is a type of computer software wherein the source code is distributed under a special type of licence in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to inspect, alter, and redistribute the software. OSS projects are collaborative endeavours which have multiple contributors who are constantly joining, leaving, or changing their role in the project. This ever‐changing and ever‐transient nature of OSS project contributors contributes to a contributor turnover‐induced knowledge loss in OSS projects. In this case, “knowledge loss” refers to the phenomenon of the loss of project‐specific knowledge, experience, and expertise in an OSS project, caused by contributors regularly joining and leaving the OSS project. This paper describes the design and development of a robust research methodology and contributes towards the formation of proactive knowledge retention practices in OSS projects to transform contributor's use of knowledge and engagement in knowledge‐relevant activities including knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer.

Students enrolled in the program were invited to participate with 257 of the 387 choosing to participate, (response rate ranging 56%-72% per year level). No attrition of knowledge across the years was observed, instead, a significant increase in knowledge, measured by total LO and HO scores (P < 0.0005), throughout the program. There were significant increases in both low and high cognitive scores which were not uniform, with high-order scores increasing significantly in the last two year levels. The increase of knowledge, may be explained, at least partially, by the vertical and horizontal integrated curriculum. Retrieval of knowledge, especially in clinically applied formats, may have led to an enhanced ability to apply anatomy knowledge and account for the increased scores in the high-order knowledge seen in the later clinical years. Evaluating anatomy knowledge retention at different cognitive levels seems to provide a better assessment and is worth considering in future anatomy educational research.Attrition of anatomy knowledge has been an area of concern in health professions curricula. To ensure safe and effective clinical practice, the study of chiropractic requires a good knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy. In this study, musculoskeletal limb knowledge retention was investigated among students in the 5-year chiropractic program at Macquarie University, Australia. A test of 20 multiple-choice questions, categorized into low-order (LO) and high-order (HO) cognitive ability according to Bloom's Taxonomy, was developed.

Abstract: Traditional medicinal plants play a central role in primary health care in most African communities, including that of the Maasai. Unfortunately, the local Maasai knowledge is under enormous pressure from introduction of agriculture, population growth, and climate change—all of which affect availability and regeneration of natural resources and ecosystem services which are accompanied by erosion of traditional knowledge. Loss of medicinal plants and the knowledge related to them would have devastating effects on the Maasai community. Therefore, it is important to document the plants and the traditional knowledge related to their use, and conservation and management. We interviewed 31 informants who were especially knowledgeable about medicinal plants. Based on these interviews, we document 62 plant species that the Loita Maasai use as medicine, and we describe the parts of the plant that are used, the methods of preparation, and how they are used. We rank them according to their importance to the people and discuss the management practices developed for these resources, and we evaluate the conservation status.

Abstract: Introduction Poor knowledge retention is one reason for medical student attrition in learning and has been a huge concern in medical education. Three-dimensional virtual reality (3D-VR)-based teaching and learning in medical education has been promoted to improve student learning outcomes. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of 3D-VR in knowledge retention in human anatomy courses as compared to traditional teaching methods among medical students. Methods A convergent mixed methods design was utilized to evaluate learning outcomes in terms of short- and long-term knowledge retention scores among students using 3D-VR and those using traditional models and to describe students' experiences and views of the use of 3D-VR as a teaching and learning tool. Results Male students who used the 3D-VR tool had significantly higher short- and long-term knowledge scores than males who used the traditional methods. Meanwhile, females who used traditional methods showed significantly higher short-term knowledge scores than females who used 3D-VR. Conclusion Medical students described 3D-VR as a learning tool with a great deal to offer for learning human anatomy as compared to traditional methods. Therefore, we recommend adding the use of 3D-VR in the anatomy curriculum. However, several 3D-VR limitations were also identified, which may hinder its utilization for teaching and learning. These concerns must be addressed before 3D-VR tools are considered for implementation in medical education human anatomy courses.Introduction Poor knowledge retention is one reason for medical student attrition in learning and has been a huge concern in medical education.

Abstract: Mobile devices have penetrated all spheres of human activities, including education. Previous research has shown that smartphones are becoming widely used in learning as they can improve knowledge retention and increase student engagement. The purpose of this study was to discuss students’ perception of the use of a mobile application aimed at learning new English vocabulary and phrases and describe its strengths and weaknesses as perceived by the students. In total, 28 university students answered a pen and paper questionnaire survey after experiencing the app during one semester. Overall, the students’ agreement to the positive aspects displayed in the questionnaire prevailed over their disagreement or neutral opinions. The mobile app helped students prepare for the final achievement test, learning was accessible from anywhere and at any time, students appreciated the corrective feedback and would opt for the implementation of the mobile app in other courses taught at the faculty. On the other hand, as the findings indicate, the students reported that the app was not very supportive regarding communication performance; they did not find the teachers’ notifications encouraging and they did not use the pronunciation support much, which was caused by various factors, such as offering students words and phrases without context or not testing all the items in the final credit test. The findings of this study contribute to the existing knowledge of students’ perceptions of the use of mobile apps for learning purposes.

Abstract: The rapid growth in diversity of information and communication technologies (ICT) enables a range of teaching methods, learning support strategies, and education settings to be developed. Questions about appropriate, effective, and efficient use of educational technology in teaching mathematics have been gaining more attention. This study focuses on the design and testing of an interactive learning textbook (eBook), created with Geogebra applets and up-to-date web technologies. The eBook is designed to meet the pedagogical and didactic needs of learners, allowing a high degree of interactivity and feedback during the learning process. In order to determine the effect of the created materials on students' achievements, tests of knowledge as well as tests of retention of knowledge were used. Moreover, questionnaires and interviews for students were developed to assess the impact of interactive textbooks on the perceptions of learners concerning mathematics, interactive materials, and the learning process. Students who have used the interactive eBook show statistically significant increased knowledge and knowledge retention compared to students who have attended the standard classes. Students also emphasized that tasks with interactive applets and new kind of learning materials inspired them to learn more, both in school and at home.

Abstract: The study explored the application of closed-book, open-book and cheat-sheet exams in an undergraduate cost and management accounting course at a university in Ghana. 198 students participated in an exploratory study examining how the different exam types impact on exam scores, pre-exam anxiety and knowledge retention. The study improves on the methods used in prior studies by, simplifying the estimation of pre-exam anxiety, and controlling for general student aptitude (GPA) in the specification of model. ANOVA was used to analyse the data. The results of the study provide compelling support for the application of cheat-sheet exams even though the perceptual views of students regarding this exam type were quite low on several variables and parameters.

Abstract:  Diagnostic ultrasound has a crucial importance in clinical settings, especially in intensive care medicine where bedside ultrasound has become indispensable. Medical students as well as residents therefore have a strong interest in learning this useful skill. Since staff resources are limited, more and more universities are using student tutors in a peer-assisted learning concept (PAL) to teach medical students early in their training. To date, there is very sparse data about knowledge retention after peer-assisted teaching. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PAL is a suitable method for teaching complex skills like abdominal ultrasound and to evaluate whether students do achieve adequate long-term knowledge retention after peer-assisted teaching. BACKGROUND  Diagnostic ultrasound has a crucial importance in clinical settings, especially in intensive care medicine where bedside ultrasound has become indispensable. Medical students as well as residents therefore have a strong interest in learning this useful skill. Since staff resources are limited, more and more universities are using student tutors in a peer-assisted learning concept (PAL) to teach medical students early in their training. To date, there is very sparse data about knowledge retention after peer-assisted teaching. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether PAL is a suitable method for teaching complex skills like abdominal ultrasound and to evaluate whether students do achieve adequate long-term knowledge retention after peer-assisted teaching. A total of 40 volunteer 3 rd to 5 th year students were randomly assigned to a basic abdominal ultrasound course in small training groups of 5 persons each. Participants were evaluated using a pre-post-test design by a validated objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) before and immediately after the course. To measure the retention of knowledge, 15 former participants were randomly selected to repeat the OSCE assessment after one year. METHOD  A total of 40 volunteer 3rd to 5th year students were randomly assigned to a basic abdominal ultrasound course in small training groups of 5 persons each. Participants were evaluated using a pre-post-test design by a validated objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) before and immediately after the course. To measure the retention of knowledge, 15 former participants were randomly selected to repeat the OSCE assessment after one year. All groups showed a significant improvement in practical skills and knowledge gain after the training with mean values of 13.1 for pre-test compared to 83.5 (maximum 100 points) for post-test (p < 0.001). The overall score achieved after one year was 78.7 and did not significantly differ from the post-test result. RESULTS  All groups showed a significant improvement in practical skills and knowledge gain after the training with mean values of 13.1 for pre-test compared to 83.5 (maximum 100 points) for post-test (p < 0.001). The overall score achieved after one year was 78.7 and did not significantly differ from the post-test result. PAL is effective for teaching abdominal ultrasound. Students were able to accomplish a satisfactory level of ultrasound skills. We further demonstrated that PAL can assure long-term knowledge retention. CONCLUSION  PAL is effective for teaching abdominal ultrasound. Students were able to accomplish a satisfactory level of ultrasound skills. We further demonstrated that PAL can assure long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the USA, and malnutrition secondary to cancer progression and treatment side effects is common. While abundant evidence indicates that nutrition support improves patient outcomes, it is estimated that up to half of malnutrition cases are misclassified or undiagnosed. The use of a multidisciplinary team to assess nutrition status has been observed previously to reduce delays in nutritional support. Hence, educating all members of the oncology healthcare team to assess nutrition status may encourage earlier diagnosis and lead to improved patient outcomes. Thus, the objective was to perform a pilot study to assess change in knowledge and self-efficacy among oncology team members after watching an educational video about malnutrition. PURPOSE Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the USA, and malnutrition secondary to cancer progression and treatment side effects is common. While abundant evidence indicates that nutrition support improves patient outcomes, it is estimated that up to half of malnutrition cases are misclassified or undiagnosed. The use of a multidisciplinary team to assess nutrition status has been observed previously to reduce delays in nutritional support. Hence, educating all members of the oncology healthcare team to assess nutrition status may encourage earlier diagnosis and lead to improved patient outcomes. Thus, the objective was to perform a pilot study to assess change in knowledge and self-efficacy among oncology team members after watching an educational video about malnutrition.A pre-test post-test educational video intervention was given to 77 ambulatory oncology providers during weekly staff meetings at a community ambulatory oncology center in central Illinois. Change in knowledge and self-efficacy in malnutrition assessment and diagnosis was measured and acceptability of the brief educational video format was also observed. METHODS A pre-test post-test educational video intervention was given to 77 ambulatory oncology providers during weekly staff meetings at a community ambulatory oncology center in central Illinois. Change in knowledge and self-efficacy in malnutrition assessment and diagnosis was measured and acceptability of the brief educational video format was also observed.Mean test scores improved by 1.95 ± 1.48 points (p < 0.001). Individual occupational groups improved scores significantly (p ≤ 0.005) except for specialty clinical staff. Self-efficacy improved from 38 to 70%. 90.8% of participants indicated the educational video improved their confidence in assessing malnutrition. RESULTS Mean test scores improved by 1.95 ± 1.48 points (p < 0.001). Individual occupational groups improved scores significantly (p ≤ 0.005) except for specialty clinical staff. Self-efficacy improved from 38 to 70%. 90.8% of participants indicated the educational video improved their confidence in assessing malnutrition.The educational video was well accepted and improved knowledge and self-efficacy of malnutrition assessment and diagnosis among ambulatory oncology providers. Wider implementation of such an educational intervention and longitudinal testing of knowledge retention and behaviors change is warranted. CONCLUSIONS The educational video was well accepted and improved knowledge and self-efficacy of malnutrition assessment and diagnosis among ambulatory oncology providers. Wider implementation of such an educational intervention and longitudinal testing of knowledge retention and behaviors change is warranted.

Abstract: The rapid growth in diversity of information and communication technologies (ICT) enables a range of teaching methods, learning support strategies, and education settings to be developed. Questions about appropriate, effective, and efficient use of educational technology in teaching mathematics have been gaining more attention. This study focuses on the design and testing of an interactive learning textbook (eBook), created with Geogebra applets and up-to-date web technologies. The eBook is designed to meet the pedagogical and didactic needs of learners, allowing a high degree of interactivity and feedback during the learning process. In order to determine the effect of the created materials on students’ achievements, tests of knowledge as well as tests of retention of knowledge were used. Moreover, questionnaires and interviews for students were developed to assess the impact of interactive textbooks on the perceptions of learners concerning mathematics, interactive materials, and the learning process. Students who have used the interactive eBook show statistically significant increased knowledge and knowledge retention compared to students who have attended the standard classes. Students also emphasized that tasks with interactive applets and new kind of learning materials inspired them to learn more, both in school and at home.

Environmental Sanitation Planning: Feasibility of the CLUES Framework in a Malawian Small Town

Abstract: Compared to the growing mega-cities or the languishing rural areas, small towns are generally less prioritized by governments and donors, both because they appear less immediately troublesome and because they defy easy classification. However, small towns bear the problems of both density extremes: on one hand, small towns face rapid population growth and struggle to collect revenue from the growing tax base, but on the other hand, do not have the political might or institutional capacity to lobby for services and resources from central government and as a result, must find ways of providing big-city services, with rural-area means. The Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) tool was developed to assist small towns with the planning and implementation of environmental sanitation infrastructure and services; through a participatory, action-research project, this work tested the financial, social, and technical feasibility of following the CLUES framework in Luchenza, a Malawian small town. Results obtained over the 2 year, 7-step process revealed that the high turnover of government staff affected institutional knowledge retention, acceptance and continuity and ultimately the potential to engage in a successful planning exercise. Because baseline data was outdated or non-existent, data collection activities consumed unexpected amounts of time, and the results were, because of internal movement and politics, difficult to disseminate and leverage. Most importantly, stakeholder participation was limited and relied on participation and transportation payments, which have become a permanent feature of “community development” in Malawi. Following the CLUES process was expensive, time consuming and politically fraught; it is unlikely that any small town in Malawi would be able to follow the process as outlined. A simplified version, making use of available data and followed only by small towns with a functioning planning department, adequate tax collection, organized community groups and a budget for final implementation would have a greater potential to succeed.

Abstract: The technical knowledge and expertise possessed by employees are considered amongst an organization’s greatest assets, but are also most vulnerable and can be easily impacted or lost. The loss of experienced employees and important knowledge can put an organization’s competency in great jeopardy. Thus, it is critical to address the challenge of proper knowledge transfer and retention proactively rather than reactively. Public sector organizations have their unique characteristics and are facing emerging HR challenges due to market changes. Most of the current knowledge retention approaches are either outdated and ineffective or developed without considering the features of public sector organizations. A study that overlaps computational and data science techniques with HR data management in light of these features is considered to be a strategic and systematic development that advances existing methods in knowledge retention and overcomes the emerging HR challenges faced by many large public organizations. In the scope of this work, several data tools are studied for their applications to HR databases, with the objectives of enhancing perception on organization-wide attrition risk distribution, identifying critical knowledge at risk of being lost, and choosing the most suitable provider and recipient for a set of knowledge sharing programs. Moreover, an integrated computational system is developed for Georgia DOT. The system uses an existing HR database and provides modular tools to assist HR personnel strategically plan for a range of activities, aiming for increased level of knowledge transfer and lower employee turnover rate, among other benefits. The system is further evaluated by both user experience feedback, as well as a few “use cases” discussed with the end users. The main contributions of this thesis are: 1) This thesis proposes an unprecedented way to transform the classic organizational chart into a more informative network style chart. Several network metrics are developed to inventively describe knowledge management-related attributes of employees; 2) This work develops an innovative approach for systematically and quantitatively evaluating a range of knowledge retention metrics. An inventive workflow is also designed and implemented for conducting various knowledge transfer activities; and 3) A novel computational system, which integrates both existing data tools and the newly developed approach and framework, is designed, developed and deployed at Georgia DOT to assist human resource data management and to enhance organization knowledge retention.

Intellectual Property Protection Decisions and Formal Innovation Partnerships

Abstract: This research investigates the relationship between IP protection and formal innovation partnerships decisions of firms. This is important as some research suggests that participating in innovation partnerships has a positive effect on the performance of firms. However, formal innovation partnerships predispose firms to strategic management challenges that include the risks of involuntary loss of knowledge. Prior studies on formal innovation partnerships are predicated on the assumption that IP protection facilitates innovation partnerships decisions of firms, minimising the potential for innovation partnerships decisions to inform IP protection strategies. Formal innovation partnerships have been described as a hard form of openness. The primary focus in this research is not on IP protection in innovation partnerships but on the decisions that firms make to either protect IP inside the firm or to utilise IP in formal innovation partnerships. This is important as empirical research has shown that participating in formal innovation partnerships increases the risk of IP infringement considerably. The transaction cost economies view of the firm and profiting from innovation framework are used to develop the conceptual framework. Multiple case studies are conducted using semi-structured interviews of firms participating in seven formal innovation partnerships across three different high-technology sectors. Findings suggest that the relationship between IP protection and formal innovation partnerships decisions of firms is one of interdependence and can either complement or oppose each other. This is evident in the challenges associated with sharing knowledge relevant for the success of a partnership while simultaneously protecting knowledge that firms do not intend to share in the partnership. Furthermore, the results highlight key internal and external determinants of the relationship between IP protection and formal innovation partnerships. This research contributes to prior management literature on IP protection and innovation partnerships by providing a basis for deepening the understanding of the links between IP protection and formal innovation partnerships decisions of firms. The typology of formal innovation partnerships model also offers a useful tool for understanding and classifying innovation partnerships in ways that capture IP protection concerns in different formal innovation partnerships. This has implications for management and policy. Managers can build on insights from the typology of formal innovation partnerships model for making informed decisions that appreciate IP protection-related risks in different innovation partnerships. Similarly, policymakers can derive insights from the model to design and develop programs with terms and conditions tailored to suit the IP protection concerns linked to different innovation programs and partnerships.

Abstract: Postpartum depression (PPD) can impact the mother, her child, and other household members, and at higher rates for low-income and Latina women. Barriers to care, including cultural relevance, result in low rates of diagnoses and treatment. In response, the Mothers and Babies Course (MBC) was created for culturally appropriate preventative care. The MBC has empirical support for efficacious and effective PPD prevention, including for low income and women of color, in multiple settings, when provided by trained paraprofessional and professionals, and is in implementation phase. The aim of the study was to assess effectiveness of the provider MBC training to increase participant knowledge of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs), key principles of the MBC (i.e., healthy management of reality [HMOR], cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]), and self-efficacy (SE) to provide MBC to consumers at pre (T1)/post (T2) and 8–12 week follow up (T3). Professional and paraprofessional backgrounds were included in assessment. The participants ( N = 41) were public and community mental health employees whose organizations contracted for online MBC training, some including supervision or consultation, also included in assessment for a relationship with knowledge outcomes. Knowledge of PMADs, HMOR, and SE were statistically higher at T2 compared to T1. Professional background and prior knowledge of CBT and MBC were not statistically related to knowledge of PMADs, HMOR, or CBT from T1 to T2; however, it was for SE. Statistical significance of knowledge retention via SE at T3 was demonstrated, but not for PMADs and HMOR as compared to T1. CBT was not analyzed due to high attrition rates. No change in knowledge was not found between those who had supervision or consultation and those who did not. The assessment provided preliminary empirical support for effective dissemination and implementation of the MBC intervention. This is important for evidenced-based practices (EBPs) in general given the low rates of effectiveness outcome differences when compared to treatments as usual (McLeod et al., 2018). Lastly, the study addresses the importance of culturally appropriate care, including paraprofessional workers, and supervision in the implementation process.

Abstract: Knowledge should be retained because it is an organisational asset. The management of knowledge, particularly knowledge retention, has been widely researched by several scholars. However, little research has been done on facilitating knowledge retention in the organisational cross-border mergers of the telecommunication industry in Lesotho. The purpose of this study was to describe and explain the process of knowledge retention in the context of organisational cross-border mergers in Lesotho, particularly in the telecommunication industry. This is a quantitative case study research that triangulated interviews and questionnaires as instruments of data collection. Quantitative data were gathered from all 14 the staff members of Econet telecom Lesotho who went through the merger process as well as 14 former employees of the organisation who left the organisation for different reasons during the merger. Qualitative data, on the other hand, were gathered by means of interviews from selected staff members who held managerial positions. The aim was to check for consistency and corroboration of the findings. Quantitative data analysis was done with the assistance of Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) and qualitative data were analysed through thematic analysis. The responses from the questionnaires retained 75% and four participants were interviewed. The findings of the study indicated that although there were no formal policies in place that guided the retention of knowledge, somehow knowledge was retained during the merger process. On the other hand, a considerable amount of valuable knowledge may have been lost because employees who either left the organisation during the process or those who were apparently forced to resign just left the organisation with no proper knowledge retention arrangement. The results of the study also showed that the Econet Telecom Lesotho merger was accompanied by a high staff turnover resulting from both forced and voluntary resignations. Moreover, the results showed that there were visible cultural differences between the two organisations. The cultural differences appeared noticeable even at the managerial level. Furthermore, the findings also pointed to the fact that those cultural variations tended to impede knowledge retention between staff members as they had different cultural backgrounds. Based on the findings, the study makes the following recommendations: it is important to have a knowledge management policy in place to guide all knowledge management activities in organisations, including those in the telecommunications industry, and this study therefore recommends the development of a knowledge management system at Econet Telecom Lesotho. This study also recommends a thorough cultural due diligence exercise for future cross-border mergers. The study also proposes a framework for knowledge retention in the organisational cross-border mergers.

Abstract: The identification of patient deterioration is significant because, in its absence, adverse events may go unnoticed and quickly escalate in severity. Only 17.4% of patients experiencing inhospital cardiac arrest are seen by medical response teams, such as a rapid response or code blue team (Chan, et al., 2016). The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to determine if the frequency and rationale for RRT and code blue calls are related to nursing staff exposure to a deterioration recognition education program. Eleven medical surgical and five progressive care units at an urban academic medical center were included in the study. RRT and code blue calls were analyzed before and after the education intervention occurred. The data was analyzed using hierarchal negative binomial regressions. The analysis revealed that as the proportion of nurses that were trained in a unit increased over time, the percentage of RRT calls significantly increased (IRR 0.997, [CI 95%: 0.984, 1.010], p = 0.614). The analysis also indicated that there were significantly more RRT and code blue calls for the cardiac (IRR 1.08 [1.05,1.11], p = 0.001) and respiratory reasons (IRR 1.09 [1.06, 1.12], p < 0.001) in the post ALERT period. These findings imply that trained nurses are identifying deterioration before cardiopulmonary arrest. They also suggest that the simulation training may have bearing on knowledge retention that is effectively used later in practice. More research is needed on deterioration education involving multifaceted educational programs involving simulation. Lastly, further scholarly inquiry is encouraged to explore the impact of proactive educational programs on patient outcomes.

Abstract: A introdução de ferramentas multimédia no ensino superior permitiu a emergência de diferentes metodologias, como a micro-aprendizagem móvel e a ludificação. Estas ferramentas complementares são introduzidas com o objetivo de envolver os estudantes na aprendizagem, permitindo-lhes monitorizar o seu progresso e aumentar a retenção dos conceitos. O objetivo da dissertação é avaliar o impacto destas metodologias no desempenho académico, valor percebido para a aprendizagem e interesse, com a motivação de criar a base de desenvolvimento de uma aplicação ludificada móvel para o contexto específico do ensino em Engenharia. O estudo foi realizado com estudantes da Unidade Curricular de Física I do Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Electrotécnica e de Computadores, da Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto. Utilizou-se a plataforma ludificada Kahoot ! durante as aulas para autoavaliação de conceitos básicos do programa da UC e, numa segunda fase, após o término das aulas, como auxílio ao estudo para os exames, onde foram integradas questões cognitivas e afetivas para recolher o feedback dos estudantes. O estudo foi realizado durante a pandemia de Covid-19, em que as aulas presenciais foram substituídas por aulas online, tornando-se pertinente um estudo consequente do impacto do ensino à distância nas variáveis analisadas. Alternate abstract: The introduction of multimedia tools in higher education allowed different methodologies to emerge, such as mobile micro-learning and gamification. These complementary methodologies are introduced with the aim of improving students’ engagement in the learning process, allowing them to monitor their own progress and increase knowledge retention. The objective of this dissertation is to evaluate the impact of these methodologies on academic performance, perceived value for learning and self-efficacy, with the aim of creating the design and implementation basis for a physics micro-learning gamified platform for engineering programs. The study was conducted on two different phases at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, with the students of the Physics I Course Unit of the Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering. The gamified platform Kahoot ! was used during both testing phases for self-assessment of basic physics concepts. During the first phase, Kahoot ! was used in online classes for self-assessment of the concepts covered in the Physics program and, in the second phase, it was used as a study aid for the exams, where in each kahoot cognitive and affective questions were integrated, in order to collect student feedback regarding the adopted learning methodology. The study was conducted during the Covid-19 outbreak, making a further study on the impact of social isolation and online classes in the variables analyzed relevant and necessary.

Abstract: O “saber-fazer” da arte da tanoaria, envolve uma prática ancestral, sendo a aprendizagem em contexto a forma mais comum de transmissão destes “saberes” entre trabalhadores mais experientes e os mais novatos, os principais intermediários para o exercício desta atividade profissional. A transmissão de conhecimentos, estudada sobre o olhar da psicologia do trabalho, carateriza-se pela sua versatilidade, que permite o acompanhamento do avanço tecnológico embora exija, ao mesmo tempo, uma constante adaptação por parte dos trabalhadores face às adversidades neste meio. Assim, a pertinência deste trabalho recai sobre compreender o processo de aprendizagem envolvido na aquisição de experiência na arte da tanoaria, tendo em vista a forma de a fazer perdurar. Com intuito de compreender melhor como se desenvolve o processo inerente à transmissão de conhecimentos e competências no setor do artesanato, mais especificamente no ofício de tanoeiro, recorreu-se a uma abordagem de investigação qualitativa, contando com o contributo de uma equipa de sete tanoeiros, que possibilitaram a contemplação de experiências humanas em contexto específico. Assim, partindo da perspetiva individual de cada trabalhador, resultado da análise das entrevistas semiestruturadas e da observação em contexto de trabalho, foram reunidos os dados que dão resposta aos objetivos gerais e específicos da presente investigação. Os resultados indicam que o processo de mentoring impulsiona o desenvolvimento das aptidões dos novatos, no entanto o esforço físico e as lesões associadas ao exercício desta atividade colocam em causa o aprimoramento de certas competências, reflexo das condições ambientais e estruturais associadas às oficinas de tanoaria. Coadjuvante a estes fatores, também o vínculo laboral e a ausência de formação inicial, são referidos como fatores preponderantes no insucesso da integração de novos aprendizes. É percetível que a reforma dos mestres desta arte gera um alerta sobre a possibilidade da perda de conhecimento do ofício, em contraste, foram identificados aspetos contributivos para o prevalecimento do mesmo, como a implementação de planos de formação mistos, assumindo um carácter formal e em consonância o acompanhamento e transferência de conhecimento on job. Alternate abstract: The "know-how" of the art of cooperage, involves an ancestral practice, learning in context being the most common way of transmitting this "knowledge" between more experienced workers and the more novice, the main intermediaries for the exercise of this professional activity. The transmission of knowledge, studied from the point of view of work psychology, is characterized by its versatility, which allows the monitoring of technological advances although it requires, at the same time, a constant adaptation on the part of workers in the face of adversities in this environment. Thus, the relevance of this work lies in understanding the learning process involved in acquiring experience in the art of cooperage, in view of how to make it last. In order to better understand how the process inherent to the transmission of knowledge and skills in the craft sector develops, more specifically in the craft of cooper, a qualitative research approach was used, with the contribution of a team of seven coopers, that enabled the contemplation of human experiences in a specific context. Thus, starting from the individual perspective of each worker, the result of the analysis of semi-structured interviews and observation in the work context, data that meet the general and specific objectives of this investigation were gathered. The results indicate that the mentoring process drives the development of the skills of newbies, however the physical effort and injuries associated with the exercise of this activity call into question the improvement of certain skills, reflecting the environmental and structural conditions associated with cooperage workshops. In addition to these factors, also the employment relationship and the absence of initial training, are referred to as preponderant factors in the failure of the integration of new apprentices. It is noticeable that the retirement of the masters of this art generates an alert about the possibility of loss of knowledge of the trade, in contrast, contributory aspects were identified for its prevalence, such as the implementation of mixed training plans, assuming a formal and consonance the monitoring and transfer of knowledge on job.

Abstract: A aprendizagem da Química, quando é baseada em contextos atuais e relevantes para os alunos, potencia a aprendizagem significativa e estimula o conhecimento do meio. Também a ciência cidadã, que envolve ativamente os cidadãos na investigação científica, tem-se mostrado bem-sucedida junto das comunidades e o envolvimento dos alunos nesses projetos apresenta um grande potencial pedagógico. Assim, aliando estas duas abordagens, surge o projeto PVC – P erceiving the Value of Chemistry – que envolveu os alunos na monitorização da qualidade das águas costeiras, dos distritos do Porto e de Aveiro, para a aprendizagem da Química e a consciencialização para o problema do lixo marinho. Este projeto, implementado em 2018/2019, envolveu 574 aluno do 3.º Ciclo do Ensino Básico (442 alunos do grupo experimental e 132 do grupo de controlo) e nove professores de Físico-Química de quatro escolas destes distritos. O projeto PVC foi desenvolvido em três etapas principais, visando: 1) promover a consciencialização ambiental e a relevância da Química para a sociedade; 2) analisar a qualidade de águas costeiras, detetar microplásticos nessas águas e identificar resíduos plásticos das praias para promover a aprendizagem da Química; e 3) divulgar o projeto e partilhar os resultados com a comunidade e em plataformas de ciência cidadã. Para avaliar o impacto do projeto PVC foram aplicadas três escalas atitudinais e testes de conhecimentos, conduziram-se entrevistas a alunos e professores e analisaram-se registos dos alunos e as notas de campo do investigador. A análise dos dados obtidos sugere que o projeto PVC promoveu: i) o reconhecimento da importância da Química para a sociedade e a consciencialização dos alunos para as problemáticas ambientais exploradas, verificando-se ainda que houve uma influência nas boas práticas ambientais em algumas famílias; ii) mudanças atitudinais positivas ao nível da análise crítica e face à Físico-Química; ao nível das atitudes face ao ambiente, emergem também indicadores de que o projeto contribuiu positivamente para uma mudança atitudinal; iii) a aprendizagem dos conteúdos de Química, em particular daqueles definidos nos currículos da disciplina; iv) a retenção de conhecimentos o que sugere que as aprendizagens realizadas no âmbito do projeto PVC possam ter sido significativas; e v) o desenvolvimento profissional dos professores coadjuvantes ao nível da diversificação das suas práticas letivas e da sua adequação aos objetivos da flexibilidade curricular pelo potencial interdisciplinar do projeto PVC. Não obstante as limitações inerentes ao estudo, é de sublinhar a importância da investigação realizada para aprofundar o conhecimento sobre o potencial pedagógico dos projetos de ciência cidadã para aprendizagem formal da Química e para a promoção de atitudes positivas dos alunos face à Ciência, à Físico-Química e ao ambiente. Alternate abstract: Chemistry learning, when based on actual and relevant contexts for students, enhances meaningful learning and stimulates environment knowledge. Citizen science, which actively involves citizens in scientific research, has also been proven successful within communities. Students’ engagement in these projects has considerable pedagogical potential. Thus, combining these two approaches, the PVC project - Perceiving the Value of Chemistry – emerged and involved students in monitoring the coastal waters quality for the learning of chemistry and awareness of the problem of the marine litter of Porto and Aveiro districts. This project was implemented in 2018/2019, involving the participation of 574 students from the lower secondary education (442 students from the experimental group and 132 students from the control group) and nine Physicochemical teachers from four schools in these districts. The PVC project was developed in three main phases, aiming: 1) to promote the environmental awareness and Chemistry relevance for the society; 2) to analyse the coastal waters quality, to detect microplastics in these waters and to identify plastic waste from beaches in order to promote Chemistry learning; and 3) to disseminate the project and share the results with the community and in citizen science platforms. To evaluate PVC project impact, three attitudinal scales and knowledge tests were applied, interviews were conducted to students and teachers, and analysed students’ records and researcher field notes. The analysis of the obtained data suggests that the PVC project promoted: i) the acknowledgement of chemistry relevance for the society and students’ awareness for the explored environmental problems, furthermore, some families were influenced by good environmental practices ii) positive attitudinal changes at the level of critical analysis and concerning Physicochemical; regarding environmental attitudes, indicators reveal that the project had a positive contribution towards attitudinal change; iii) learning Chemistry contents, particularly those defined in the subject curricula; IV) Chemistry knowledge retention suggests that learning realised within the PVC project may have been relevant; and v) the professional development of the supporting teachers in terms of diversity of their teaching practices, and of their adjustment to curricular flexibility objectives through the interdisciplinary potential of the PVC project. Despite the implicit study limitation, it is worth highlighting the research relevance undertaken to enhance the pedagogical potential of citizen science projects for formal learning in Chemistry and to promote students’ positive attitudes towards science, physics, chemistry and the environment.

Abstract: Background/ Objective: In our current healthcare system, information seekers have a bulk of the responsibility to initiate conversations about medications. Although older adults report the need for more information about their medications, many do not accept offers to receive more information from pharmacists during the dispensing of prescription medications. Very little previous work focuses on how older adults make decisions about seeking and avoiding information about medicines, or how these decisions impact medication outcomes. Therefore, the specific aims of this study were to: 1) describe older adults’ attitudes about medication information seeking and the relationships between those attitudes and medication information management behaviors and 2) characterize the relationship between medication information management behaviors (MIMB), medication knowledge, medication beliefs, and attitudes towards medication information seeking. Methods: Older adults prescribed a new, chronic medication were recruited from a specialty geriatric clinic to participate in interviews that occurred either in-person or over the phone. Participates were randomized 1:1 to usual care or to patient-prompted medication counseling (PPMC). Participants in the PPMC group agreed to ask a pharmacist questions about their new medication at their next medication refill and received a brief education. A survey instrument based on the Theory of Motivated Information Management (TMIM) was adapted from past studies to assess participants’ attitudes about information seeking. Participants were asked to report their information seeking and avoidance over the previous six-months prior to the study and at baseline and month one. Open-ended questions from a national medication safety campaign were utilized to assess medication knowledge. A rubric was developed to score participants’ answers as incorrect knowledge, no knowledge, incomplete knowledge, or complete knowledge and used by two community pharmacists to determine patient medication knowledge (PMK) scores. Structural equation modeling was utilized to identify predictors of MIMB, and hierarchical and logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between MIMB and medication outcomes. Results: A total of 132 participants completed baseline surveys, and 126 participants completed the month one surveys. Overall, a structural model based on the TMIM met the a priori criteria for good fit (Bollen-Stine bootstrap=0.269). Participants’ positive outcomes assessments, negative outcomes assessments were direct, positive predictors of information seeking and direct, negative predictors of information avoidance. After controlling for baseline medication knowledge, the effect of the intervention, and information seeking there were statistically significant differences in medication knowledge between those participants that sought information from a pharmacist during refill dispensing and those who did not (B=0.259, p<0.001). Of those that sought information from a pharmacist, 70% gained information from baseline to month one, while 36.9% of those that did not seek information from a pharmacist gained information baseline to month. There were no differences in medication beliefs between those that sought information from a pharmacist and those that did not. Discussion/ Conclusion: Patient knowledge deficits continue well beyond the initial dispensing of a medication, and older adults are also at risk for knowledge loss over the course of prescription use. Receiving additional information from a pharmacist at the time of medication refill may be protective against this information loss, and even increase the change of gaining medication knowledge over time. However, medication counseling in its current form is likely not sufficient to alter older adults’ beliefs about medications. Only one pharmacist initiated a conversation with a participant at medication refill indicating that those participants who want additional information about their medications after the initial dispensing may have to initiate the conversation with a pharmacist.

Abstract: This research was a pilot study in a larger project that focused on how to retrieve knowledge from retiring long-term employees of a small university utility plant, incorporate that material into their existing training program, and during the process reduce the training time for current and future employees. Wade utility plant faced the retirement of eight employees with nearly 200 years of corporate knowledge within three years, but their current training program required seven to nine years to complete. The study utilized interviews, first-hand observation and partnership with current employees to explore how best to obtain the corporate knowledge that would be lost when the proletarian workers retired. The study revealed that the training program needed to be updated, and communication, trust and training evaluation continuity needed to be addressed. Due to these issues, trust was built through transparency by the researcher, and suggestions were made to management for moving forward. This study adds to the body of knowledge by utilizing knowledge capture techniques in a utility plant, highlighting effective knowledge capture techniques for proletarian workers, the importance of corporate planning for the effect of group retirements, and how incorporating proletarian workers into training creation can make a positive impact on company relationships.

Reliance of the Field Supervisors on Experience-based Tacit Knowledge and Barriers to Knowledge Sharing

Abstract: Generally, the trade supervisors are seen swapping stories about how they have done things differently in their previous projects that had resulted in saving manhours and resources. Since most of them are doing repetitive tasks for years, they rely mainly on their judgments and intuition while making decisions and have developed a plethora of knowledge throughout their experience. They often find it difficult to articulate the knowledge they have acquired most of which is tacit. There is a need to identify this tacit dimension of knowledge to harness it effectively as tacit knowledge is one of the factors determining the competitiveness of a construction firm. The skills shortage in the industry is further aggravated by the workforce attrition. Employee retirements and knowledge loss are compelling the specialty contracting firms to capture this tacit knowledge to prepare the future workforce. This study posits an instrument to gauge the reliance of the field supervisors on tacit knowledge and identifies barriers to knowledge sharing through case studies involving electrical contracting firms. The findings of this research clearly show that the experience level of an individual is related to the reliance on tacit knowledge. Most of the experienced field supervisors rely on the tacit dimension of knowledge to perform the major dayto-day routine tasks at the construction site. The education level of an individual seems to have no significant relation with the acquisition and usage of tacit knowledge. Findings also suggest that the viewpoint of the management and the field team are disparate regarding the barriers to knowledge sharing. Management feels that lack of formal processes prevents the trade professionals from sharing their knowledge among themselves whereas according to the field team lack of socialization is identified as the key barrier. Similarly, managers' resistance to change is identified by management as the key barrier that prevents supervisors or managers from sharing their knowledge with the subordinates whereas, for the field team it is the lack of encouragement from the management. Moreover, according to management, lack of formal processes is the key barrier at the organizational level but for the field team, it’s the silo mentality of the managers. The organizations must incorporate the feedback from the field team into the decision making related to knowledge management (KM). The developed framework will benefit the trade contractors to identify on what type of knowledge the field supervisors are relying to perform a particular task and eventually categorizing knowledge into explicit and tacit.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of a blended learning approach to enhance students’ vocabulary knowledge and vocabulary knowledge retention in English as a foreign language (EFL) classrooms at the tertiary level in Thailand. This was to address challenges in relation to practice and use of English language, rote learning and memorisation, limited one-to-one interaction with peers and teacher, lack of learner-centredness, and low rate of knowledge retention. This study was conducted as a quasi-experimental design, employing the sample from four intact classes with a total of 146 students who registered in an English course at a university in Bangkok, Thailand. The sample was divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was exposed to the flipped classroom model, while the control group was taught in the traditional setting. Research tools consisted of an English language proficiency test, vocabulary pre-test, post-test, and delayed test, questionnaire, interviews and observations. The quantitative findings revealed a negative overall impact of the blended learning instruction on the experimental group, and on some particular classes and different academic majors. Gender differences and correlations occurred between language proficiency, vocabulary knowledge and knowledge retention. Qualitative results indicated that students and teachers had positive perceptions and attitudes towards feasibility of the approach. Although the blended learning method is perceived in a positive and feasible way, it may only be applicable for some particular groups or types of learners. Hence, different aspects regarding nature of learners and language learning should be taken into consideration, these include: language abilities, background knowledge, gender, academic majors, learners’ characteristics and capabilities, content and assessment, and selective types of technology.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/ivisit-using-360-degree-interactive-digital-sites/docview/2740840906/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Problem-solving and collaboration are increasing necessities for the 21st century construction workforce. The new frontier of human-technology requires professionals to work on complex problems, each bringing his or her own expertise to find an appropriate solution. Often, the physical and social context associated with the problem determines participant cognitive reasoning processes and peer interactions for a successful resolution. Construction disciplines use problem-solving and collaborative learning approaches to increase student conceptual learning, knowledge retention, and critical thinking. Nevertheless, hands-on interaction with construction contextual information is often impossible to obtain in a classroom setting, requiring students to visit locations that are inaccessible, dangerous, or expensive to reach. Consequently, students with reduced exposure to construction spatiotemporal contexts lack skills for integrative decision-making, communication, discussion engagement in real-world work-based situations. Additionally, limited financial resources, time constraints, and standardized educational curricula introduce other challenges for educational institutions and teachers to integrate these activities in their programs. The challenges present on traditional classroom instruction further broaden when using online delivery methods. Students who are geographically dispersed pose further barriers for supporting equitable problem-solving and collaborative learning due to the difficulties or impossibility to reach the required locations. These problems in construction education translate into the industry as students are assimilated in the workforce with a deficient understanding of problem-solving and collaboration at professional work environments. To address this lack of construction learning opportunities within real-world contexts, this research explored the use iVisit – 360-degree panoramic environments supported by virtual humans for realistic site visits. iVisit enables students to practice problem-solving and collaboration within construction spatiotemporal contexts, offering the basic skills required to approach these situations upon entering the industry. Specifically, iVisit aims to supplement current site visit interventions when these are available within the construction curriculum or to offer an alternative when these contextual interventions are not available to students. In this research, the exploration of iVisit was performed using two district approaches – iVisit Problem-Solving and iVisit Collaborate. For iVisit Problem-Solving, a comparative analysis between-subject experimental evaluation was performed by contrasting a traditional paper intervention and a digital iVisit intervention. Student performance was evaluated to investigate the use of such virtual environments for practicing situated problem-solving. The findings for iVisit Problem-Solving indicate that the effects of iVisit virtual environments varied depending on the methodological requirements of the problem-solving activities. iVisit Problem-Solving was found to significantly increase the student development of problem-solving skills during empirical related activities such as observation of site material properties and their relationships. However, no significant differences were detected between paper and iVisit interventions to enhance the student understanding of abstract theoretical knowledge. For iVisit Collaborate, a phenomenological study was performed to understand how student dyad behaviors affected the collaborative problem-solving process within iVisit virtual environments. The findings in iVisit Collaborate suggest that student collaborative behaviors did not directly generate successful problem-solving. A hierarchical relationship between student problem-solving and collaborative behaviors was observed, indicating that problem-solving behaviors must take place to enable the occurrence of collaborative behaviors. Student discussion engagement supported the exploration of the problem space, enabling the construction and maintenance of shared mental models. Moreover, It was observed that instructor scaffolding helped to reduce the degrees of freedom in the complex problem-solving activities and to promote student discussion engagement.

Abstract: Basic sciences are a cornerstone of undergraduate medical education (UME), upon which the clinical sciences are built, however, research indicates that students’ basic science knowledge is not well retained. Additionally, UME curricula vary with respect to which basic science content is delivered, the depth in which it is taught, and the employed instructional methods, which could influence trainees’ knowledge retention. Thus, there is a need for an educational model that ensures students are competent in the fundamentals prior to entering a clinical setting. This investigation provides insights into current strengths and potential areas for improvement with respect to basic science pre-clerkship curricula. The aims of this research were to: i) determine clerkship directors’ perceptions of necessary basic science concepts, along with strengths and areas for improvement, with respect to students’ basic science knowledge; ii) assess medical students’ knowledge retention of the identified basic science concepts; iii) determine where, when, how, or if, the identified basic science concepts were taught during pre-clerkship; and iv) assess medical students’ knowledge reinforcement levels of the identified basic science concepts during clerkship. We established that students are expected to have some knowledge of every basic science prior to clerkship, and the identified concepts mapped to each systems-based pre-clerkship course. Additionally, directors’ perceptions of potential areas for improvement outweighed strengths. On average, students retained ≥60% of relevant basic science knowledge from pre-clerkship, and reinforced concepts during each clerkship rotation. Mapping the concepts to curricular content revealed that where, when, how, or if, the concept was delivered during pre-clerkship did not influence students’ basic science knowledge, nor did clerkship group or rotation order. Interestingly, even though lower-performing students demonstrated the greatest post-test improvement, they still left each rotation with knowledge deficits compared to their highest-performing peers. Thus, while they did not catch up to their highest-performing peers, the clinical experience of clerkship appears to be most beneficial for lower-performing students. This may suggest that earlier integration of clinical learning with the basic sciences could foster students’ basic science knowledge, thereby ensuring that all trainees are well-equipped with the necessary knowledge prior to clerkship.

Abstract: Introdução: A hidrocefalia é uma complicação frequente entre os pacientes neurológicos e seu tratamento em casos agudos é por meio de um cateter de derivação ventricular externa que possibilita a monitorização e o controle da hipertensão intracraniana. O objetivo desse estudo foi descrever a retenção do conhecimento dos enfermeiros após intervenção educativa sobre cuidados com derivação ventricular externa. Materiais e Métodos: Estudo quase experimental com enfermeiros de uma unidade de terapia intensiva adulto, em que foi avaliado a retenção de conhecimento sobre o tema em três momentos: antes, uma semana e três meses após o treinamento. Resultados: Houve retenção significativa após uma semana, mas não aos três meses, sendo que aos três meses o índice de acertos nas questões foi expressivamente baixo em relação às fases anteriores. O desempenho dos participantes foi melhor nas questões relacionadas ao manuseio do sistema. Discussão: O tempo é um fator que interfere no aprendizado e os estudos mostram que o conhecimento aos 3 meses diminui significativamente, sendo que aos 6 meses e um ano quase que completamente. Condutas práticas baseadas em diretrizes de assistência tem melhor retenção entre os profissionais, ressaltando que há mais facilidade no aprendizado de habilidades técnicas que estão associadas a vivência profissional. Conclusões: Houve retenção de conhecimento significativa entre os profissionais na primeira semana após o treinamento, mas não aos três meses após o treinamento. Alternate abstract: Introduction: Hydrocephalus is a common complication among neurological patients whose treatment in acute cases is done through an external ventricular drain catheter which allows monitoring and controlling intracranial hypertension. This study aimed at describing the knowledge retention by nurses after an educational intervention on nursing care for an external ventricular drain. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental study with nurses at an adult intensive care unit was conducted in which knowledge retention on the topic was evaluated at different three times: before, one week and three months after training. Results: After one week, significant retention was observed but not after three months, given that after this period the question success rate was significantly low with respect to the previous phases. Participants' performance was better in those questions related to system management. Discussion: Time is a factor that interferes with learning since studies show that knowledge at three months significantly decreases and is almost completely gone after six months and a year. Practical behaviors based on assistance guidelines have better retention among professionals, underlining that it is easier to learn technical skills that are associated with professional experience. Conclusions: A significant knowledge retention was observed among professionals in the first week after training but not after three months.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/delving-deep-into-fetal-ultrasound-video-analysis/docview/2647410056/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Over the last five decades, ultrasound imaging has revolutionized the quality of prenatal healthcare through the course of pregnancies. There have been significant achievements towards improving the design, reliability and versatility of ultrasound hardware. A key aspect that has been a bottleneck in the widespread adoption of ultrasound imaging is the requirement of a high degree of expertise for both performing an ultrasound scan and inferring meaningful diagnostic information from the same. With recent innovations in medical image analysis, it is high time that we explored the possibilities of automating the diagnostic understanding of fetal ultrasound videos for clinically useful diagnostics. Specifically, ultrasound image and video analysis can potentially benefit from the improvements in pattern recognition and image understanding brought upon by the recent proliferation of machine learning algorithms. This thesis explores facets of automated analysis of fetal ultrasound videos and frames for a breadth of clinical applications including view classification, anatomical structure detection, continually learning algorithms over variable data distributions and utilisation of human expert knowledge into automated ultrasound image analysis tasks. Concretely, the contributions of this thesis are: 1. Temporal encoding algorithms for spatiotemporal aggregation of fetal ultrasound video sequences towards visibility assessments, standard fetal cardiac viewing plane identification and cardiac region localization: We showed that aggregating spatial features over temporal windows in a hierarchical fashion allowed the identification of fetal standard cardiac viewing planes with an overall accuracy of 0.8358 along with localization of the fetal cardiac region. Localization of anatomical structures in the Four Chamber standard view of the fetal heart was also obtained over available video sequences. 2. Ultrasound video interpretation algorithms that enable novel classes or instances to be added over time without significantly compromising prediction abilities on prior learnt representations: We showed that using the proposed incremental learning pipelines controls forgetting in deep neural networks for ultrasound video analysis as compared to standard transfer learning methods, achieving average drop in accuracies of 0.011 between additions of three novel classes over subsequent learning sessions. This is in addition to generalization to the new classes added with average accuracy on new classes of 0.6420 for the proposed pipeline compared to 0.4508 by naive transfer learning methods. Further, explainable continual learning pipelines for ultrasound image analysis were developed by extending concepts of activation maps to the class incremental learning problem so as to quantify metrics for assessment of multi-class incremental learning in terms of activation map quality. 3. Improving the efficiency of ultrasound image analysis models with sonographer gaze assisted distillation: We combine deep learning based methods with the expertise of sonographers by utilizing information obtained from eye-tracking data as a prior encoding domain expertise. We showed that it is possible to improve performance of reduced or memory-efficient models using sonographer gaze data with the best performing memory-efficient models attaining performance within 5% of conventional models 1000× larger in size. The ideas explored in the thesis are aimed at contributing to the knowledge of how to design efficient ultrasound video analysis with the reliability of high-fidelity knowledge retention across learning sessions, and to explore the feasibility of improving model performance through the inclusion of human expert knowledge and experience.

Abstract: Improving the quality of equipment training for the Heavy Equipment Operators (HEO) is a critical task in the ever-lasting effort to improve safety and eliminate equipment-related injuries in mining environments. Traditional miner training includes the use of hardcopy documents and video instructions. However, modern mobile and computer technology offers tremendous potential to improve the training process. One major responsibility for the heavy-machine operators is proper machine inspection. Establishing new training methods that utilize modern technologies—such as 360-degree images, videos, and Virtual Reality—and implementing computers for training purposes have a potential to help new operators learn how to conduct proper machine inspections in a more efficient and technically correct way. This technology could potentially provide a higher knowledge retention rate for heavy machine operators. This study utilizes a 360-degree camera, open-source platform WordPress™, and the software Unity3D in order to create materials and tools for the HEOs training, which in turn will help trainees to better understand the pre-shift machine inspection. The outcomes of this research are organized into three major phases: Gathering materials, Computer-Based Task-Training (CBTT) software, and Virtual Reality (VR) application. The 360-degree images/videos, 2D images, and sounds were first gathered, edited, and incorporated into the CBTT and VR applications. The major feature of the CBTT, developed with WordPress™, is its training template with instructions on creating a new training course for the HEOs. The training courses developed for this study cover seven different machines that are widely used in surface mines. Also, the CBTT software is optimized for use on mobile devices (such as smart-phones and tablets). The VR applications for the same machines are developed with one of the most popular game engines - Unity3D. To interact with the virtual world, a trainee can use the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) iii Oculus Rift CV 1, which establishes full immersion while performing the virtual tour of a selected machine. If used without HMD, applications become non-immersive desktop versions and can be controlled by using a mouse and keyboard. The user-friendly interface and multimedia environment are comfortable to handle, flexible, and potentially more convenient to use than paper-based documents. The CBTT and VR applications were developed, tested, and implemented at a surface coal mine in the southern United States.

The Relationship Between Knowledge Management Culture and the Performance of Knowledge Management in the Singapore Police Force : a Critical Realist Approach

Abstract: Knowledge plays a vital role in policing, as the ability to manage knowledge effectively and efficiently has been recognised to contribute positively to the likelihood of mission success (Tan & Al-Hawamdeh, 2001:318). However, the research on knowledge management (KM) in policing is limited as policing is a niche area, and information is tightly controlled. This research aims to explore the KM culture in the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and its relationship, if any, to the performance of KM in the organisation. A critical realist approach is adopted to examine the perceptions of research participants, as they experience the KM activities and practices occurring in the organisation. Data is collected from conducting twenty-two semi-structured interviews and the review of knowledge-related documents and analysed using thematic analysis. The findings indicate that the KM culture, which is in the developmental stage, has resulted in a lack of consistency in the KM practices. Nonetheless, the strong receptivity and sense of personal responsibility towards the practice of KM has the potential to be the catalyst to improve the KM performance in the organisation. In terms of human resource management practices, the results show that the regular staff movements (in terms of job rotations) and sudden staff departures could intersect with the inconsistent practices and result in knowledge loss. The findings also suggest that the frequency and duration of job rotations are factors that may affect the attitude towards the practice of KM. Ample time is needed for knowledge to be transferred and internalised to overcome knowledge loss because of staff movements. These occurrences, if not managed, will lead to the loss of institutional knowledge, both explicit and tacit. For knowledge collaboration, the results outline the discrepancy between the perceived willingness and the actual practice of knowledge sharing with the external stakeholders; the unfamiliarity of the existing KM framework to manage the accessibility of confidential documents has resulted in the limited success of such external collaborations. The management plays a vital role to drive the KM culture by creating the supportive workplace culture, to integrate the KM framework with the work processes and implement the appropriate technological measures. Technology has been identified as an enabler in the practice of KM and plays a pivotal role in the performance of KM in the organisation. The findings may be of interest to human resource management practitioners, researchers with an interest in KM in the public sector and public officers serving in law enforcement or similar fields.

Abstract: The cyclic format of the undergraduate physics curriculum depends on students’ ability to recall and utilize material covered in prior courses in order to reliably build on that knowledge in later courses. However, there is evidence to suggest that people often do not retain all, or even most, of what they learned previously. How much information is retained appears to be dependent on the individuals’ approach to learning as well as the style of instruction. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that active engagement techniques in the classroom can improve students’ retention of the material over time. Here, we report the findings of a longitudinal investigation of students’ retention of conceptual understanding as measured by the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) following a first-semester, calculus-based introductory physics course, which features significant active engagement in both lecture and recitation. By administering the FMCE at the end of a first-semester physics course and again at the beginning of the subsequent second-semester physics course, we examine students’ knowledge retention over time periods ranging from 1 to 15 months. We find that the shift in students’ FMCE scores between these two courses is positive but corresponds to a small effect size, indicating that students retained effectively all of their conceptual learning (as measured by the FMCE). This finding largely persists even as the length of the gap between the two courses increases. We also find that, when breaking out students’ performance on individual questions, the majority of students maintain their score on individual questions. Averaged over all questions, roughly a fifth of the students switched their answers from right to wrong or wrong to right on any given item.

Abstract: L'industrie nucléaire, relativement récente, s'engage actuellement dans une phase de déconstruction de ses installations devenues obsolètes et de traitement de ses résidus. Les informations relatives à la contamination des sites, aux caractéristiques des déchets qui y ont été entreposés par le passé ou qui seront issus des zones à assainir, se révèlent souvent lacunaires. Ces données, regroupées sous l'appellation « mémoire de l'installation » par les professionnels du secteur, sont pourtant essentielles dans la conduite de ces chantiers. Cet article traite des formes d'oubli et de permanence du passé dans le cadre d'opérations de démantèlement et de reprise des déchets anciens. L'auteur prête une attention particulière aux façons dont la mémoire des « anciens » y est mobilisée au regard des mutations de l'organisation du travail. Il apparait que des modes de gestion, de management et de traçabilité peuvent entraver le partage de l'expérience et générer une perte de savoirs. Alternate abstract: The nuclear industry, which is relatively recent, is currently engaged in a phase of deconstruction of its obsolete facilities and treatment of its residues. Information on the contamination of the sites, the characteristics of the waste that has been stored there in the past or that will come from the areas to be remediated, often proves to be incomplete. These data, grouped together under the name "installation memory" by professionals in the sector, are nevertheless essential for the conduct of these worksites. This article deals with the forms of forgetting and permanence of the past in the context of dismantling operations and the recovery of old waste. The author pays particular attention to the ways in which the memory of the "old" is mobilised in relation to changes in the organisation of work. It appears that modes of administration, management and traceability can hinder the sharing of experience and generate a loss of knowledge.

Abstract: This study seeks to explore the application of tacit knowledge by knowledge workers in the development department of a multinational auto manufacturer. While the existing literature on tacit knowledge outlines the importance of tacit knowledge to organisational performance (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Sternberg et al., 1995; Spender, 1996; Baumard, 1999; Gore and Gore, 1999; Jafari, Akhavan and Nourizadeh, 2013), research on tacit knowledge is still underrepresented (Brown and Duguid, 1998; Holtshouse, 1998; Leonard and Sensiper, 1998; Zack, Rand and Wilsh, 1999; Garcia-Perez and Mitra, 2007; McAdam, Mason and McCrory, 2007). Authors in the field of tacit knowledge including Kabir (2013), McAdam, Mason and McCrory (2007), Sumbal et al. (2017), Holtshouse (2010) call for further research in the field of tacit knowledge related to the identification of tacit knowledge and the potential of using specific methods in research on and management of tacit knowledge. Furthermore only a few studies on tacit knowledge in the automotive sector exist. Hence relatively little is known about tacit knowledge usage in the automotive sector. The aims of this study are 1) to identify specific tacit knowledge frequently used by knowledge workers in the product development department of a multinational car manufacturer and 2) to further explore the tacit knowledge usage by eliciting how and why it is used in achieving organisational goals. This embedded researcher single case study in the product development department of a multinational automotive company employed a mixed methods approach conducted in two sequential steps. The quantitative first step analysed internal job advertisements for evidence of epitomes of tacit knowledge (Haldin-Herrgard, 2003) and discovered the areas of the highest concentration of application of such. The second step used semi-structured interviews to discover the “hows” and “whys” of tacit knowledge application in the frequently used forms – skills, experience, and abilities – in achieving organisational objectives of automotive development. This research contributes new knowledge in research on tacit knowledge in the automotive sector as called for by Jafari, Akhavan and Nourizadeh (2013) as well as the call by Kabir (2013) for the development of an approach to identify tacit knowledge in organisational data. The concept of epitomes of tacit knowledge (ETK) developed by Haldin-Herrgard (2003) is employed in this research and makes use of quantitative content analysis and elicits tacit knowledge from organisational data. Although it contributes new knowledge on how epitomes of tacit knowledge can be conceptualized to act as a construct for managing tacit knowledge as demanded by McAdam, Mason and McCrory (2007). ETK were used in the context of content analysis to quantify the amount of tacit knowledge and to identify frequently applied forms of tacit knowledge in different knowledge worker positions. With the approach of quantifying the amount of applied tacit knowledge by knowledge workers in different positions employed in this research, this research contributes new knowledge on assessing the risk of possible knowledge loss in case of employee leavings, thus answering a request from Sumbal et al. (2017) and Holtshouse, (2010). The upshot is that tacit knowledge intensive positions can be identified and classified according to the amount of potential tacit knowledge loss. Finally, the results provide new insights into individual applications of 1) tacit knowledge in the form of social skills to facilitate development work in this department 2) tacit knowledge in the form of experience in knowing what has or has not worked in the past so as to avoid problem-related inefficiencies, and 3) tacit knowledge in the form of abilities to approach and solve problems – all three of which are combined and applied as means of reaching the product development goals of this multinational automotive manufacturer.

Abstract: There is a need to retain highly skilled and specialized talent in today’s dynamic and highly competitive global business environment. The challenge is not only selecting, recruiting, and hiring the right talent, but also making sure that talent is retained for as long as possible after the hire date. The intention of employees to stay employed is critical and a strategic business differentiator for organizational success due to the high cost of recruitment, the intrinsic loss of knowledge and expertise, and the often non-documented and not understood loss of productivity. The purpose of this dissertation was to evaluate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI), SOAR and retention (RET) among a sample of professionals who are actively working with a direct supervisor. A sample of 352 participants completed the 16-item Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale to estimate their leaders’ EI, the 19-item SOAR profile to estimate their leaders’ SOAR-based capacity, and the Intention to Remain scale to self-report their RET. This study was designed as a quantitative cross-sectional survey design to investigate three research questions and test three study hypotheses regarding the EI and SOAR-based capacity of leaders, and the effects leader EI and leader SOAR have on subordinate RET. Participants were either active members of an Alumni Association of a Midwestern University, or current working and former professional contacts of the researcher. Survey data were analyzed using general linear model (GLM) statistical analysis. Results found statistical support for leader EI and leader SOAR as positive predictors of subordinate RET. Results also found SOAR moderated the relationship between EI and RET in males but not females. The implications of this study would suggest that employers and higher education instructors must embrace the challenge of identifying the right talent with the relevant EI abilities and SOAR capabilities (soft skills) required for today’s business needs such as: critical thinking, collaboration, active listening, interpersonal skills, strategic thinking, and communication. In addition to collaborating with higher education on the development and the teaching of EI and SOAR soft skills, organizational leaders should create a culture that encourages all employees to have inclusive and meaningful conversations. This can be accomplished utilizing the SOAR capabilities of active listening, engagement, communication, and the creation of meaningful dialogue.

Abstract: Article info Article History: Received: 10 Feb. 2020 Accepted: 18 Apr. 2020 epublished: 6 June 2020 Keywords: Board exam, Difficulty factor, Discrimination index, Residency pre-board exam, Structural principles, Taxonomy Abstract Background: Designing and conducting residency exams have been the province of type I universities since 2005, based on the plans of the Medical Education Council. Another advantage is that multiple-choice question can evaluate a wide range of learners' knowledge in a short period.3 On the other hand, one significant limitation is the difficulty of designing questions according to clear rules and appropriate taxonomy.3 Although multiple choice tests are useful in examining the knowledge level of large groups of test subjects, a lack of familiarity with multiple choice design techniques significantly reduces the power and performance of this type of test.4 The more questions are used in the design of the test, the more correct the taxonomy will be, resulting in more useful results to support the purpose of the test, which is to measure student attainment and knowledge retention.5 One method for the preparation of theoretical questions is MCQs, for which Millman has created a checklist to evaluate question design accuracy.6 The taxonomy of an exam question is a classification in which the level of testable knowledge is measured. Encyclopedia exams, and promotion of clinical disciplines in medical education residency courses, are conducted annually as a type of certification assessment used to rank and decide the promotion of assistants to higher years or to obtain a degree to serve the community. Since 2006, according to the Secretariat of the Medical and Specialty Education Council, designing and holding exams for promotion of clinical assistantships has been entrusted to type I medical universities to increase the participation of faculty members of medical departments of medical universities of the country, towards the independence of universities, the generalization of the transfer of educational powers. [...]it is necessary to review and evaluate this process (designing questions and conducting university promotion tests).

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study Knowledge Management (KM) practices in a number of higher education institutions from Europe, Asia, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, as reported by the respective faculty members. The KM practices assessed were Knowledge Perception (KP), Knowledge Gathering (KG), Knowledge Creation (KC), Knowledge Sharing (KS), Knowledge Diffusion (KD), and Knowledge Retention (KR) and compared across the three regions to understand the similarities and differences in KM practices. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire and distributed online among faculty members of various universities in Europe, Asia and GCC countries. To draw meaningful inferences, scales for reliability, one-way ANOVA and T-test were used to analyze, compare and interpret the data. The results indicate that there are no significant differences among the higher education institutions regarding KP, KC, KS, and KD. There is, however, a significant difference with regards to KG and KR. The findings of the study help to serve as input to higher education institutions from three different regions in developing best practices of KM for improving performance.

Abstract: Currently, there are four generations working in organizations globally. Many companies are facing corporate tacit knowledge loss as senior managers and executives retire. The problem is that some organizational leaders do not have an integrated information technology plan in creating, documenting, managing, sharing, and preserving organizational knowledge, particularly tacit knowledge. The lack of information technology strategy to manage the creation, storing, transfer, and retention of tacit knowledge is exacerbated as talented young workers are leaving organizations in searchfor better career opportunities. The purpose of this qualitative classical Delphi was to get a consensus from a panel of executive and senior manager experts on a strategy and plan to create, store, share, and keep tacit knowledge in an IT organization. The study was limited to one IT company. A panel of nine experts with senior management experiencein IT project teams reached a consensus after three rounds. The major themes focused on mentoring, communication, environment, and leadership. The experts suggested a mentorship strategy and growth mindset incentive as a future framework to close the tacit knowledge gap. Leaders and practitioners were recommended to offer reverse mentoringand cross generational mentoring programs to effectively share and keep tacit knowledge in organizations. Future research suggested exploring personality traits of those willing to share tacit knowledge. Moreover, exploring tacit knowledge sharing strategies in other industry companies and government agencies. The study findings reinforced the need for multigenerational organizations to find a strategy and incentive plan to close the tacit knowledge gap.

Abstract: Santa Ana, California has the highest teenage birth rate in Orange County, USA, at 28.2 per 1,000 women aged 15–19 as compared to 12.0 per 1000 women of similar age elsewhere in the county. In the light of this disparity, University of California Irvine medical students surveyed a convenience sample of 9th grade students (aged 14–15 years) in Santa Ana to assess the efficacy of a medical student-led sex education programme. Nine 50-minute sex education lessons were conducted over a 2-week period, with pre- and post-tests to evaluate knowledge retention. A total of 301 pre-tests and 295 post-tests were collected. Of 27 multiple choice questions, the mean number of correct questions on the pre-test was 11.3 (± 4.2) compared to 14.1 (± 5.0) questions on the post-test. There was significant improvement in scores following the implementation of the curriculum (p < 0.001). Overall, findings demonstrate that medical students can effectively teach a sex education curriculum. The study serves as a potential model for sex education in geographic areas that exhibit disparities in teenage birth rates.

Abstract: Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of pediatric first-aid training methods on caregivers' and teachers' knowledge retention. Study design: This was a randomized longitudinal cohort study. Methods: A stratified random sampling method was used to select 1282 caregivers and teachers with the help of local education authorities in 18 districts and 1 county of Shanghai, China. The selected caregivers and teachers were randomly allocated into groups that were exposed to 3 models of training, including an interactive training model (group A), lecture-based training model (group B), and video instruction training model (group C), for pediatric first-aid training for caregivers and teachers (PedFACTs). Before and after the training, a descriptive questionnaire composed of demographic information and 37 simple-choice questions about first aid was administered. During the follow-up, 120 caregivers and teachers from each of the three methods were randomized and retested 9 months after their training and 120 caregivers and teachers were randomly reselected in each of the three methods and retested 4 years after their training. Results: Immediately after training, there was a significant difference in the postassessment results between groups A and B ( P = 0.002) as well as between groups A and C ( P < 0.001). The average interactive training model score was the highest, followed by the instruction training model and video instruction training model. There was no significant difference among the three groups in the reassessment scores at 9 months and 4 years after training ( P = 0.744, P = 0.595). The difference in passing the assessment among the three groups at 9 months or 4 years after training was not maintained at a significant level. Conclusion: The three training methods did not affect knowledge retention of the caregivers and teachers at nine months or four years after training completion. Video instruction may be an effective, convenient, and feasible method to train caregivers and teachers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)

Abstract: Organizations can lose knowledge as fast as they can create it. Retiring Baby Boomers, job-hopping Millennials and out-of-date communication and collaboration practices contribute to organizational knowledge loss. This knowledge loss costs organizations billions of dollars for re- learning and for hiring, onboarding and training new employees. Knowledge management strategies foster knowledge retention and are critical to facilitating innovation. Knowledge management can be enhanced using collaborative technologies such as enterprise wikis, instant messaging, collaborative writing, project management, blockchain and semantic web technologies powered by artificial intelligence. Through a systematic review and synthesis of 46 critically appraised studies that span global contexts and sectors, this dissertation informs scholars and practitioners by providing evidence and recommendations to global organizations looking to implement, adopt or utilize collaborative technologies to retain knowledge, prevent knowledge loss or establish and strengthen an organizational culture that fosters knowledge management. Through thematic synthesis and qualitative analysis of inductive codes across scholarly articles, this research highlights aspects of affordances (access to knowledge, knowledge sharing across organizational boundaries, searchability) and organizational culture (knowledge sharing culture, transparency, the role of management) as keys to strategically leverage collaborative technologies for knowledge management. Organizations can retain their knowledge and build innovative capacity by systematically adopting and implementing collaborative technologies. By fostering transparency and knowledge sharing across boundaries, encouraging managers and leaders to promote a collaborative and transparent culture, and prioritizing the continued use of these technologies, organizations can maximize their knowledge management outcomes.

Abstract: Long-term multiple myeloma therapy by immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) raises the question of management of adverse effects. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of an educational session for patients on the acquisition of knowledge to manage hematologic and thromboembolic adverse effects of IMiDs. In this prospective single-center study, patients attended an educational session with a hospital clinical pharmacist and a nurse. The primary endpoint was the patient's level of knowledge for the management of IMiDs adverse effects, assess with a dedicated questionnaire administered before the session then 1 and 6 months after. Assessment of knowledge was combined with self-assessment of certainty. The secondary endpoints were adherence and IMiD treatment satisfaction. 50 patients were included. Patient knowledge increased at 1 month (p<0.001) despite a loss of knowledge at 6 months (p<0.05). Six months after the educational intervention, the number of patients with skills considered satisfactory by the pharmacist and nurse increased (p<0.01). Most patients showed satisfactory adherence, with medication possession ratio ≥ 80%. The Self CARe and MEdication Toxicity (SCARMET) study highlighted the impact of multidisciplinary follow-up in multiple myeloma patients to improve knowledge of toxicity self-management.Long-term multiple myeloma therapy by immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) raises the question of management of adverse effects.

Experiential Learning Effects on Knowledge Retention and Higher-Order Thinking Skills: A Study of Kolb's Experiential Learning Model in the Introductory Managerial Accounting Course

Author: Routh, Thomas Brian

Publication info: Routh, Thomas Brian. 

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/experiential-learning-effects-on-knowledge/docview/2467153652/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: In this study, a four-stage experiential learning intervention was used to determine whether single-topic simulations affect knowledge retention and higher-order thinking skills in introductory managerial accounting. This research also examined the role of students' preferred learning style on knowledge retention and higher-order thinking. Based on Kolb's Experiential Learning Model and Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, this study employed a pre-test, intervention, post-test quasi-experimental design using business students in an introductory managerial accounting course at a mid-sized, AACSB accredited, Midwestern, U.S. university as subjects. The pre-/post-test included 10 multiple-choice questions and one short-answer problem to assess the first three levels of Bloom's Taxonomy: knowledge/remember, comprehension/understanding, and application. Preferred learning style was determined using version 3.2/4.0 of Kolb's Learning Style Inventory. Subjects in the experimental group completed a simulation relevant to process costing in a manufacturing environment. The primary findings suggest that an experiential learning simulation has no impact on knowledge retention and higher-order thinking in introductory managerial accounting. In addition, the results suggest that knowledge retention and higher-order thinking are not affected by a student's preferred learning style. However, secondary analysis provides some evidence that junior/senior level accounting majors, in an introductory accounting course, may benefit from classroom activities designed around Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle because their preferred learning styles may not be established as other literature suggests. This study extends the current research on simulations used in an introductory accounting classroom and the possible effectiveness of a simulation designed using Kolb's Experiential Learning Model. Beyond addressing the concerns of the AECC and others, this study contributes to the accounting education literature by examining the usefulness of experiential learning simulations in lower-level accounting courses. In addition, the current study adds to the accounting education literature by beginning to build evidence of learning styles of accounting majors, using version 3.2/4.0 of Kolb's Learning Style Inventory, and confirms other literature finding that accounting majors and non-accounting majors have different learning preferences at different stages in their college career and beyond.

Abstract: The aerospace and aviation industries (AAI) were vital components of globalization. In the past, the United States (US) held a dominant aerospace manufacturing industry position. It possessed a significant competitive advantage over other nations. However, the US economy was facing extraordinary global economic challenges and expected to fall behind other countries. Knowledge management is imperative in project success, but the aerospace industry practitioners lacked the knowledge and skills to manage complex projects. The problem addressed in this research study was the lack of knowledge management practices during the AAI project life cycle. This quantitative non-experimental research study is to find out the relationships of the seven knowledge management practices, namely: (a) knowledge identification, (b) knowledge creation, (c) knowledge retention, (d) knowledge sharing, (e) knowledge transfer, (f) knowledge application, and (g) knowledge assessment to project performance. This study utilized the online survey results from 124 active project managers and project team members within the AAI in the US. The data were measured with a 5-point Likert Scale. The results indicate that positive relationships existed between project performance and three operational constructs of knowledge management ( e.g. , knowledge identification, knowledge creation, knowledge application). The results also indicate negative relationships between project performance and four operational constructs of knowledge management ( e.g. , knowledge retention, knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer, and knowledge assessment). Future research may be done, perhaps researching different demographics and different geographic locations and market conditions.

Abstract: Sport-related concussions continue to be a serious epidemic for youth participants. A pathway to improper management, created by improper reporting by athletes, lack of recognition by coaches, and lack of access to athletic training services, must be mitigated through effective concussion educational initiatives. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of an online concussion education program, "Concussion in Sports," on the knowledge retention among high school football coaches over a 15-week follow-up period. A quasi-experimental repeated measure design was used to measure knowledge retention over time for high school football coaches from two parishes in south Louisiana. The main outcome measure in this study included coaches' knowledge retention in the follow-up period. The assessments consisted of 31 questions divided into three distinct subsections: signs and symptoms recognition, common concussion misconceptions, and scenario-based questions. A 2-tailed paired samples t-test was conducted to test knowledge retention. High school football coaches had significantly lower overall knowledge scores as well as signs and symptoms subsection scores on 15-week follow-up assessments compared to post-course assessments, but the participants did not have significantly lower misconception or scenario subsection scores. This study provides some foundational support that knowledge was not retained in high school football coaches in south Louisiana. This study confirms the need to continue to assess long-term outcomes to assure knowledge retention in high school football coaches after online concussion education.

Abstract: Background: Knowledge transfer is very important in knowledge-intensive organisations in both developed and developing countries. A knowledge-intensive organisation is an organisation whose operations depend on specialised knowledge. Knowledge-intensive organisations lose intellectual property when experienced employees retire from their jobs. To avoid knowledge loss, skills and expertise should be transferred from experts to non-experts on time. Knowledge transfer tools allow sharing of tacit knowledge between and amongst staff members. The study provides an analysis and review of the most effective knowledge transfer tools in knowledge-intensive organisations because an organisation’s success is based on its ability to transfer knowledge. Objectives: The study had two main objectives: to identify and review knowledge transfer tools used in knowledge-intensive organisations and to recommend the best knowledge transfer tool that can be used in organisations for the purpose of enhanced competitive advantage. Method: A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data from the research participants in knowledge-intensive organisations in Namibia. Results: The results indicate that the most effective knowledge transfer tool in knowledge-intensive organisations is a community of practice; 40% of the participants considered the tool effective, and 27% considered it to be very effective. This was followed by the mentoring tool, which was ranked 54% effective and 11% very effective by the participants because it exposes mentees to new ideas and new ways of thinking. Storytelling was ranked 28% effective and 17% very effective because it is a natural learning process. Succession plans were ranked 21% effective and 12% very effective because having succession plans in place on time is essential for organisational success. Coaching and knowledge repositories were ranked below 20% on knowledge transfer effectiveness. From the findings, we conclude that the most effective tool for knowledge transfer in knowledge-intensive organisations is communities of practice (CoP) followed by mentoring, storytelling, succession plans, coaching and finally knowledge repositories. Conclusion: The most effective knowledge transfer tool in knowledge-intensive organisations is Communities of Practice, followed by mentoring, storytelling, succession plans and lastly coaching. Communities of Practice are important for knowledge transfer in that they encourage and promote teamwork through discussions and knowledge sharing amongst employees. The study therefore recommends the creation of such Communities of Practice in knowledge-intensive organisations for effective knowledge transfer and sharing.

Abstract: Reading and comprehending the drug packaging information to guide the selection of an appropriate over-the-counter (OTC) drug is a common challenge given concerns of abuse and misuse, addiction, overmedication, and inability to select the drugs in cases where the guidance of a medical professional is not available. This research reviews data on OTC usage in the United States, reviews the process followed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the transition of drugs from prescription to nonprescription status, and highlights some risks and benefits of OTC medication. It reviews issues in OTC medication, including decision-making in selecting OTC medication, shows a relationship between health literacy and effective use of OTC medication, and covers readability and comprehensibility of the drug label as a concern in OTC drug acquisition and usage. It also reviews some studies on technology approaches in decision-making that supports the selection of OTC medication. The research proposes a technology artifact in the form of a mobile application that consumers would use to guide the selection of a drug by augmenting the drug package information with questions that a pharmacist would ask a customer looking for OTC medication. It also investigates whether the facts of medicine, as presented to a customer, cause information overload to an extent that hampers the selection of a drug, and whether the methods of information presentation differ in terms of knowledge retention, information overload, and perceived usability. The research also evaluates different multimedia methodologies in how they aid the understanding of drug label information to support the selection of an appropriate OTC drug. The study found greater knowledge retention and less information overload on users using the audio-based and video-based mobile apps than those who used text-based apps.

Trigger Warnings in the Classroom: Assessing the Roles of Appraisals and Stress Mindsets

Abstract: Trigger warnings—notices about potentially sensitive material that might activate strong emotional or physical responses—have received polarized attention for their presence on college campuses. Some scholars argue that trigger warnings are “coddling the American mind”; whereas others argue that such warnings are essential to student success. Despite media attention, there is little empirical work on trigger warnings in the college classroom. Past research has conflicting results on the effectiveness of trigger warnings and none of these studies have fully investigated the mechanisms by which trigger warnings work. In order to address how trigger warnings function in classrooms, I conducted two studies. Study 1 was designed to collect descriptive data on students’ experiences with and understanding of trigger warnings and to collect pilot data on students’ mindsets about stress and appraisals of course material. Students were moderately familiar with trigger warnings and saw trigger warnings as facilitating classroom engagement. Students, on average, saw stress as debilitating and their course material as a challenge. Study 2 tested, experimentally, whether and how trigger warnings had positive or negative effects on knowledge retention and affect. Study 2 also investigated the role of stress mindset (manipulated experimentally). Overall, Study 2 tested a theoretical model, whereby appraisals explain the effect of trigger warnings on knowledge retention and affect and stress mindset moderates this effect. Receiving a trigger warning (vs. not) before viewing a video did not influence outcomes (i.e., knowledge retention and positive or negative affect). Moreover, there was no evidence to support the proposed model: appraisals did not mediate the effect of trigger warnings on outcomes and a stress mindset intervention did not moderate this (lack of) effect. Overall, these studies suggested that whereas students generally understand the purpose behind the use of trigger warnings in college classrooms (Study 1), trigger warnings—at least in the context of this experiment—had little effect on student outcomes (Study 2). Future studies should continue to investigate the influence of how course material is framed as well as mechanisms through which trigger warnings impact student outcomes.

Abstract: Purpose: Traditional teaching methods (lectures, exams, PowerPoints, textbook readings) have long been the standard mode of educating students. Focus has now shifted from educator-centered to student-centered with an emphasis on active learning (simulation being an active form of learning). With the advent of computers and simulators, educational institutions have begun incorporating simulation scenarios into their curricula to better prepare their students who are historically more technologically advanced than their predecessors. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine if simulation teaching in healthcare education, when compared to traditional learning, provided students with a better knowledge base before entering the clinical setting. Methodology: An exhaustive literature search was completed on articles published in peer-reviewed journals in English from January 2000 – September 2019. The participants in this systematic review included all levels of nursing students, graduate nursing students, and medical students. The electronic databases searched include CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Complete, ProQuest, Medline Complete, Ovid, ERIC, Professional Development Collection, and PubMed. Search terms used were student nurse anesthetist, student anesthetist, SRNA, nurse practitioner, student nurse, graduate nursing student, DNP, CRNA, nurse anaesthetist, medical students, simulation training, simulation learning, teaching dummies, teaching mannequins, simulation teaching, simulation education, didactic teaching, lectures, traditional classroom, traditional teaching, confidence, self-esteem, critical thinking, knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and knowledge transference . Using appraisal checklists from the Joanna Briggs Institute appropriate to the study’s design and methodology, each reviewer independently appraised 33 articles. Any discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, and 14 articles were included in the analysis. Results: Two themes were identified during the systematic review: traditional education versus simulation education and benefits and perceptions of high-fidelity simulation. The primary outcomes measured in each of the studies included knowledge acquisition, knowledge retention, and knowledge transference. While the results showed that simulation training was generally perceived as a valuable and satisfactory way to acquire, retain, and transfer knowledge from the simulation environment to the clinical environment, the studies in this systematic review that reported objective and observational data provided conflicting outcomes. This systematic review was unable to provide consistent evidence-based data to support a change in healthcare education away from traditional teaching methods to high-fidelity simulation training. Implications for Practice and Research: A policy change was suggested from the literature review to include simulation teaching as a mode of education within colleges and universities as a majority of the results showed an increase in transference of knowledge from the simulation environment to the clinical setting; however, more research needed to be done to definitively show which educational technique was superior.

Whose Knowledge Matters? Shifting Knowledge Systems and Gender Roles in Manoomin (Wild Rice) Revitalization in the Great Lakes

Abstract: Manoomin is an essential component to the survival and identity of the Anishinaabeg people. Manoomin, or wild rice as it is called in English, is evidence of the fulfillment of the migration prophecies of the Anishinaabeg. However, Anishinaabeg capacities to subsist from manoomin have diminished greatly in the Great Lakes region due to multiple factors including dams and logging for the timber industry, forced removal to reservations, loss of knowledge due to boarding schools, the need for wage labor, commodification of wild rice, and the breakdown of kinship and gender systems (Child 2012 and Noorgard 2014). Even with these circumstances and the challenges they pose many Anishinaabeg are engaged in the restoration of wild rice habitats and the revitalization of the cultural practices and knowledge systems that are part of ricing. However, while the literature presents wild rice revitalization as the restoration of a “traditional” system of ricing, it is often missed that today’s ricing efforts are very different than what occurred historically. In fact, in certain areas, scholarly critics have pointed out that ricing is now a masculine activity where it was not previously (Child 2012 and Noorgard 2014), or that certain rice stories actually emanate from Anishinaabeg commercial ricing, and not the historical seasonal round (Noorgard 2014), or that most ricing programs are managed by the governments of federally-recognized Tribes whose structures differ drastically from the management regimes that would have governed ricing historically (Bureau of Indian Affairs 2014). Through three articles this dissertation shows: 1) the impacts of settler colonialism on manoomin in the Great Lakes including how manoomin became a commodity grown on a farm outside of the Great Lakes, 2) how the shifts in gender roles are impacting a group of Indigenous women today and how those women created a regenerative space called the Indigenous Women’s Manoomin Collective that wrote Article 2 of the dissertation as a Collective. The members of the Collective are seven Indigenous women from across the Great Lakes in both the United States and Canada. 3) Through a systematic analysis of newspapers in the Great Lakes in Canada and the US that show the shifts that are occurring in systems of knowledge with Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems for people that are participating in manoomin restoration projects and the silencing of Indigenous women experts in those roles.

Abstract: Federal legislation through No Child Left Behind (NCLB) (2002) and Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) (2015) held schools accountable for improved test scores and academic achievement. The heightened scrutiny in performance and expectations placed enormous pressure on students, teachers, and administrators to reach the lofty goals of the accountability model and put emphasis on state-mandated tests for several subjects. Non-tested subjects often encountered a shift in funds and their programs became diminished or even eliminated. Subjects that were not tested, such as music education, were considered non-essential. Nonetheless, the value of music used for instruction to stimulate knowledge retention was demonstrated by the National Center for Education Statistics (2012). The theory of multiple intelligences (Gardner, 2011) focused on engaging students by using a variety of techniques to increase learning. Consequently, arts integration in the core subject classroom came into being. While there was research about arts integration in the core subject classroom, limited research existed that examined core subject integration in the K-6 music classroom.  This study was conducted through email to K-6 public and private school music teachers who were currently teaching across the United States and who were members of the National Association for Music Educators. The results of the study determined which core subjects were integrated in the K-6 music classroom, the frequency of the integration, and the teachers’ self-reported value of the core subject integration. The study determined there was a positive relationship between the teachers’ self-reported value when using core subject content and their self-reported frequency of the integration; the ranking of the teachers’ self-evaluated multiple intelligences was determined, and the study determined that a positive relationship existed between the teachers’ self-reported value of core subject integration and their self-reported frequency of core subject integration.

Identifying Transfer of Care Gaps: Electronic Health Record Capture of Perioperative Handoff Communications

Author: Giarrizzo-Wilson, Sharon

Abstract: Transitions in patient care are held together by interdisciplinary handoff communications intended to coordinate the patient’s ongoing care requirements. Patients with complexity in care encumber the transfer of care process requiring a higher level of care coordination between the interdisciplinary team (Coleman, 2003; Naylor et al., 2004). While the literature is abundant on the characteristics and quality of handoff communications, it is limited on the requirements of what data is necessary for ongoing care following transfer communications (Galatzan & Carrington, 2018). This dissertation explores the verbal information transferred during Operating Room (OR) to Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) nursing handoff communications and whether the data is captured in the electronic health record (EHR) to represent the information critical to ongoing patient care and care planning. The study builds on the Kennedy Integrated Theoretical Framework (KITF) (Kennedy, 2012) integrating cognition theory, patterns of knowledge theory, and clinical communication space theory to support the human-technology characteristics within perioperative handoffs. Evidence of wisdom was present in the KITF in addition to elements of non-verbal communication patterns emerging from shared common ground contributed to the framework’s expansion. To understand the contributions of the perioperative nursing interface terminology, the Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS), makes to postsurgical care transitions, the study examines nursing diagnoses, interventions, interim outcomes and goals relationships to the handoff data communicated between OR and PACU Registered Nurses. Study findings revealed a complex fragmented process of verbal communications and electronic documentation for the handoff process. While the EHR is prominent in data procurement for the handoff process, the design of handoff artifacts (e.g., paper, electronic) significantly impact the value of information received. Incomplete handoff tools or missing EHR data adds to a cycle of information decay while contributing to increase cognitive load and potentiating opportunities for information and knowledge loss. The absence of nursing diagnoses in the automation of the PNDS challenges the integrity of the language within the documentation platform and raises considerations for hierarchical representation within interface terminologies. This study reinforces literature to reconsider user requirements in the design and functionality of healthcare information technology (HIT) to enable data and information flow and preserve knowledge development. The inclusion of mobile technology, cognitive support aids including clinical decision support tools, and other HIT will further enable the effectiveness of transfer communication, knowledge development, and the safety of ongoing patient care.

http://ezproxy.lb.polyu.edu.hk/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/knowledge-forms-project-lifecycle-blueprint/docview/2424607299/se-2?accountid=16210

Abstract: Background: Knowledge-intensive Organisations (KIO) are heavily reliant on the creation, communication and archiving of different forms of knowledge for their survival. Many KIOs that are creative agencies organise their workflows according to projects. Each phase of a project produces distinct forms of knowledge. Understanding the variations in the demands on knowledge management (KM) in step with changes in knowledge forms in different project lifecycle phases allows for the development of appropriate KM. Objectives: The research set out to use the project lifecycle in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) KIO creative agencies as an organising device for outlining different knowledge forms at each phase. The objective was to map KM forms onto the knowledge forms in each project phase. Method: A qualitative research approach with phenomenological research design was used. The empirical site was at eight organisations in Johannesburg, South Africa in the creative industries. The data was analysed using content analysis. Results: There are dramatic changes in knowledge forms at different points in a typical project lifecycle in SME KIO. However, the stages of a project are replicable and consistent between most of the projects that were analysed. Conclusion: A strategy for mitigating against knowledge loss in SME KIO creative agencies is to use a range of different KM that are appropriate to the forms of knowledge. Using the project phases as a blueprint can lead to more accurate forms of KM at each distinct stage in the project lifecycle.

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and disproportionally burdens low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Upon initiation of treatment for an active TB diagnosis, universal TB education and counseling (TEC) is recommended to promote knowledge and medication adherence. Though previous studies have shown that there are areas that can be improved when delivering routine TEC, there is limited data on how peer-led TEC can fill these gaps in Kampala, Uganda. Our study evaluated the efficacy of a peer-led TEC intervention among newly diagnosed adults initiating TB treatment in Kampala and assessed capacity for scale-up. We used a pre-post, prospective cohort study to compare two longitudinal cohorts and a parallel exploratory sequential study to evaluate implementation. Intervention outcomes included TB knowledge and retention between peer-led and routine TEC. Implementation outcomes included acceptability and feasibility among health workers. 80 patients were enrolled (June-July 2018) into routine TEC, including 22 (28%) women and 29 (36%) persons living with HIV. 81 patients were enrolled (August-November 2019) into peer-led TEC, including 25 (31%) women and 24 (30%) persons living with HIV. When comparing type of TEC, peer-led TEC had higher disease-specific knowledge scores post counseling (difference +21%, 95% CI +18% to +24%, P<.0001) and at two-weeks (Difference +18%, 95% CI +13% to +23%, P<.0001) and higher treatment-specific knowledge scores post counseling (Difference +14, 95% CI +10 to +18, P<.0001) and at two-weeks (Difference +4, 95% CI +1 to +10, P=.11). Our findings showed that peer-led TEC was more efficacious than routine TEC at improving TB knowledge. The exploratory sequential study found that peer-led TEC was perceived to be both acceptable and feasible. Future studies should address barriers to knowledge retention and scale-up of peer-led TEC.

Abstract: Some supply chain leaders in the transportation sector lack the succession planning strategies needed to fill leadership positions. The failure to create succession planning strategies will negatively impact an organization’s supply chain through tacit knowledge loss. Grounded in the social exchange theory, the purpose of this qualitative exploratory single-case study was to explore the succession planning strategies transportation industry supply chain business leaders use to fill organizational leadership positions to reduce tacit knowledge loss. The participants consisted of 6 supply chain leaders working in the Northeastern region of the United States who successfully utilize succession planning strategies to fill leadership positions and retain tacit knowledge. Data were obtained utilizing semistructured face-to-face interviews, interview notes, as well as internal company documents. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the information. Three themes emerged: address the potential loss of tacit knowledge, leaders tend to do more with fewer people, and succession planning. A key recommendation is expanded implementation of staged retirement plans and using independent contractors. The implication for positive social change includes the overall enhancement of employee lifestyles via increased social and economic standing within their workplace and the community.

Abstract: to compare the acquisition and retention of knowledge about surgical cricothyroidostomy by the rapid four-step technique (RFST), when taught by expository lecture, low fidelity and high-fidelity simulation models. OBJECTIVE to compare the acquisition and retention of knowledge about surgical cricothyroidostomy by the rapid four-step technique (RFST), when taught by expository lecture, low fidelity and high-fidelity simulation models.ninety medical students at UFPR in the first years of training were randomized assigned into 3 groups, submitted to different teaching methods: 1) expository lectures, 2) low-fidelity simulator model, developed by the research team or 3) high-fidelity simulator model (commercial). The procedure chosen was surgical cricothyroidostomy using the RFST. Soon after lectures, the groups were submitted to a multiple-choice test with 20 questions (P1). Four months later, they underwent another test (P2) with similar content. Analysis of Variance was used to compare the grades of each group in P1 with their grades in P2, and the grades of the 3 groups 2 by 2 in P1 and P2. A multiple comparisons test (post-hoc) was used to check differences within each factor (test and group). Statistical significance was considered when p 0.05). RESULTS each group was composed of 30 medical students, without demographic differences between them. The mean scores of the groups of the expositive lecture, of the simulator of low fidelity model and of high-fidelity simulator model in P1 were, respectively, 75.00, 76.09, and 68.79, (p 0.05).the simulation of low fidelity model was more effective in learning and knowledge retention, being feasible for RFST cricothyroidostomy training in inexperienced students. CONCLUSIONS the simulation of low fidelity model was more effective in learning and knowledge retention, being feasible for RFST cricothyroidostomy training in inexperienced students.

Abstract: General chemistry is a survey course meant to form a foundation for students’ to build upon as they progress into chemistry sub-disciplines. The effectiveness of this foundation rests heavily on students’ abilities to retain or relearn concepts from the course. This study seeks to investigate the utility of a measure of general chemistry students’ knowledge retention across the time period of one semester. This approach was enacted in five different courses of either first or second semester general chemistry. The results showed that one-quarter to one-half of students exhibited a high rate of retention across the semester. A smaller group, approximately one-tenth to one-fifth of students exhibited little success on both the initial or repeated offering of the exam items. The remaining students had approximately equal representation of gainers, those who improve on their performance over the semester, and falterers, those who decline on their performance over the semester. The grouping by knowledge retention was related to academic performance in the course and it was found that a high level of retention was associated with stronger academic performance. Additionally, students who retained or gained exhibit higher average academic growth over the semester. Combined, the relation to academic performance serves to highlight the importance of knowledge retention in the educational setting. The proposed methodology can be readily incorporated within a naturalistic course setting facilitating adoption for instructors and researchers to further explore students’ knowledge retention. Another study was performed asking students and peer leaders what they thought the three most important topics in general chemistry was as well as asking two free response questions asking them what information they could provide when given the chemical formula of a compound. An analysis of the responses for the question related to the three big topics in general chemistry revealed four topics that were selected as the most important more than ten times: acids/bases, equilibrium, stoichiometry and thermodynamics. One of those topics, stoichiometry, is a General Chemistry I topic that seems to persist as being an important topic for students and peer leaders. The analysis also revealed that some topics, such as electrochemistry, are believe to be important because they are the most recent subject a student has learned, but when asked the same question months later, that topic is no longer believed to be important. The two free response questions showed that peer leaders have a better ability to connect chemical properties to chemical processes and orientations, as they were able to see that the ionic compound could dissociate in water and can be oriented as a lattice. The students who learned General Chemistry II using a traditional lecture were not able to retain the same number of correct statements as peer leaders or students who were taught General Chemistry II using peer-led team learning (PLTL).

Abstract: This research aimed at investigating, within a focus group, the primary grades teachers' opinions concerning the use of photographs in Natural Sciences lessons. We asked teachers to answer nine questions on: the contents of the used photographs, their sources, the circumstances/reasons they took into account when selecting the photographs, the lesson stages when they used them, the used methods, the context in which they had got information about the manner in which photographs should have been used, the pupils' interest in using photographs during learning activities in Natural Sciences, which are the disadvantages/risks for pupils if photographs were not used, and on the challenges the teachers had to cope with when using photographs during Natural Sciences lessons. At the end of our study, we noticed the diversity of the topics and lesson stages when photographs had been used, teachers' preference for the Internet as a source of photographs although Internet connection in school was poor, and that teachers appreciated photographs as significant for pupils' motivation, to focus their attention, enabling perception and understanding of natural and human induced processes, to form their representations and enable knowledge retention in pupils' memory, to develop thinking, language, imagination, and creativity. They pointed out that in the absence of photographs for learning Natural Sciences, pupils would run the risk of not understanding or less understand the topics, and of making misleading representations.

Abstract: Santa Ana, California has the highest teenage birth rate in Orange County, USA, at 28.2 per 1,000 women aged 15-19 as compared to 12.0 per 1000 women of similar age elsewhere in the county. In the light of this disparity, University of California Irvine medical students surveyed a convenience sample of 9th grade students (aged 14-15 years) in Santa Ana to assess the efficacy of a medical student-led sex education programme. Nine 50-minute sex education lessons were conducted over a 2-week period, with pre- and post-tests to evaluate knowledge retention. A total of 301 pre-tests and 295 post-tests were collected. Of 27 multiple choice questions, the mean number of correct questions on the pre-test was 11.3 (± 4.2) compared to 14.1 (± 5.0) questions on the post-test. There was significant improvement in scores following the implementation of the curriculum (p < 0.001). Overall, findings demonstrate that medical students can effectively teach a sex education curriculum. The study serves as a potential model for sex education in geographic areas that exhibit disparities in teenage birth rates.

Abstract: Organizations spend a significant amount of money on training for their workforce and undergo many changes in terms of technology, demographics, and culture. Along with these external changes, organizations experience constant internal changes due to the emergence of newer generations in their workforce (Cahill, Fache & Sedrak, 2012). In this climate of change, workplace learning has remained one of the critical organizational investments. This changing organizational environment calls for a reevaluation of current training processes. Because training programs call for a considerable investment of time and money in organizations, it is essential to acknowledge these changes and adapt with them to remain relevant. The purpose of this study was to determine whether gamification can be used to revamp the organizational training department. An online game was customized, implemented, and evaluated to understand the impact of gamification on knowledge retention and learner perceptions. A total of 24 university employees participated in gamified-safety training. Data were collected from three data sources; namely, pre-post-test scores, participant interviews, and stakeholder interviews. Descriptive coding was used for all interview responses and eight major themes emerged from the participant and stakeholder responses and positive growth was observed in the post-test scores in comparison to the pre-test. The themes indicated that game-elements such as scoreboards, accomplishing tasks, and having an interactive fun environment helps in engaging learners in organizational training. Also, the lengthy duration of the game and lack of cohesion in game-storyline and training content emerged as drawbacks for gamified-training modules.

Abstract: High fidelity simulation (HFS) is a useful method to teach practical information without the risk of harming a live patient. It is a teaching method used in at least half of all nurse anesthesia programs, but not generally designed to specifically focus on pharmacology content. Similarly, there is no research that specifically explores the use of HFS to supplement didactic pharmacology education in nurse anesthesia. Because of this, we designed a study to investigate the impact that HFS has on the pharmacologic knowledge acquisition and retention of student registered nurse anesthetists (SRNAs). This pilot study recruited fifteen SRNAs to participate in a pharmacology curriculum that included a traditional didactic lecture supplemented with a pharmacology focused HFS experience. Their baseline pharmacologic knowledge was assessed with a pretest that indicated no significant difference in the scores (p=0.34). After the simulation, all participants scored 20% higher on knowledge assessment questions related to pharmacology content that was supplemented with simulation and 1% lower on the content that was taught via the traditional didactic lecture alone (p<0.01). One month after the simulation, participants were assessed for knowledge retention of the same pharmacologic content. All participants scored 20% higher than the pretest on the questions pertaining to the content covered in the simulation and 15% lower than the pretest on the questions that were assessing material only taught via didactic lecture (p<0.01). This pilot study strongly suggests that incorporating simulation into a nurse anesthesia pharmacology curriculum helps clinical trainees learn and retain new pharmacologic material. This educational method should be further explored as a potential means to promote safe practice in the hospital setting by increasing pharmacologic knowledge acquisition and long-term knowledge retention.

Abstract: The purpose of this holistic exploratory qualitative case study was to expand the research regarding knowledge sharing strategies in small nationwide businesses. The central and underlying research questions of the study were how employees in small businesses share knowledge, whether strategies exist in small businesses, how trust contributes to shared knowledge, whether strategies exist in small businesses, how trust contributes to knowledge sharing, whether soon to retire employees were targeted for sharing their knowledge, whether rewards or incentives were used to motivate knowledge sharing, and whether tacit and explicit knowledge is shared through specific processes. Soon to retire employees had special attention paid. A business problem existed in that small businesses did not have sufficient knowledge sharing strategies in place. Because of the lack of understanding regarding knowledge sharing strategies, a loss of knowledge when employees retire occurs, or high-knowledge employees leave a small business. Participants included two small business owners, two soon to retire employees, and six small business leaders from across the U.S., for a total of ten interviews conducted via video conferencing. NVivo software assisted the process of searching for emerging themes within the interview transcripts. Findings indicated that formal processes rarely existed in the small businesses studied, and not all individuals shared their knowledge, in part because of the lack of knowledge sharing strategies, but also because of a lack of trust. Interview participants described the use of some processes, such as safety manuals, as part of an effort to share knowledge throughout the organization. Younger employees appeared uninterested in learning processes or receiving knowledge from soon to retire workers. Recommendations for future research include using larger sample sizes of small businesses and soon to retire employees.

Abstract: A mixed method study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of passive microlearning containing multiple modes of media (MST) on adult learning. Effectiveness was measured by using the first three levels of Kirkpatrick’s 4 Levels of Training Evaluation model. The results of the training were also used to extrapolate whether a company could expect to calculate a positive return on investment (ROI). A custom programmed questionnaire based on Kirkpatrick’s model was used to gather information regarding learner satisfaction, knowledge retention, and behavior change. Satisfaction level with the chosen passive microlearning was high. Knowledge retention results were evaluated by time and further examined by age, education level, and gender. All showed significant long-term retention of information. Two of three behavior measurements changed significantly. The qualitative portion of the study used an online focus group to discuss satisfaction, perceived knowledge retention, and usefulness of passive microlearning. Focus group participants confirmed literature review findings regarding satisfaction, including benefits and drawbacks. Participants indicated that they use passive microlearning in their personal lives; however, they do not see much current use in professional environments. Participants indicated that they feel that they learn more from small bites of learning and would like to see more of this training in the professional environment; however, they also liked opportunities for training using multiple delivery options.

Abstract: Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of pediatric first-aid training methods on caregivers' and teachers' knowledge retention. Study design This was a randomized longitudinal cohort study. Methods A stratified random sampling method was used to select 1282 caregivers and teachers with the help of local education authorities in 18 districts and 1 county of Shanghai, China. The selected caregivers and teachers were randomly allocated into groups that were exposed to 3 models of training, including an interactive training model (group A), lecture-based training model (group B), and video instruction training model (group C), for pediatric first-aid training for caregivers and teachers (PedFACTs). Before and after the training, a descriptive questionnaire composed of demographic information and 37 simple-choice questions about first aid was administered. During the follow-up, 120 caregivers and teachers from each of the three methods were randomized and retested 9 months after their training and 120 caregivers and teachers were randomly reselected in each of the three methods and retested 4 years after their training. Results Immediately after training, there was a significant difference in the postassessment results between groups A and B (P = 0.002) as well as between groups A and C (P < 0.001). The average interactive training model score was the highest, followed by the instruction training model and video instruction training model. There was no significant difference among the three groups in the reassessment scores at 9 months and 4 years after training (P = 0.744, P = 0.595). The difference in passing the assessment among the three groups at 9 months or 4 years after training was not maintained at a significant level. Conclusion The three training methods did not affect knowledge retention of the caregivers and teachers at nine months or four years after training completion. Video instruction may be an effective, convenient, and feasible method to train caregivers and teachers.

Abstract: Organizations aim to keep their competitive advantage over their rivals in the marketplace. However, due to the growth of the number of older workers and their inevitable retirement, organizations are in danger of losing their competitive advantage due to knowledge loss. Therefore, companies and human resource practitioners need to find ways to motivate the older workforce to share their tacit knowledge before retirement. One strategy to accomplish this goal is through designing motivating work that can lead to tacit knowledge sharing. This study investigated the relationship between the work characteristics of autonomy, task interdependence and task significance with knowledge-sharing behavior. Additionally, the moderating impact of age on these relationships was assessed. The results of this study illustrate that there is a positive and statistically significant relationship between autonomy and task significance with knowledge-sharing behavior. However, age did not moderate the relationship between these three variables and knowledge-sharing behavior. In other words, autonomy, task interdependence, and task significance did not become more motivating as age increases. These results suggest that work design is an essential element in promoting and creating a knowledge-sharing culture within organizations to sustain and increase competitive advantage.

Abstract: Background: Transitioning from the hospital to home is linked with emotional, social, and health-related problems (Reeves et al., 2017). These transitions are ultimately and importantly linked to the safety of post-acute stroke survivors A basic strategy in improving challenges related to transitional care is providing better stroke education to patients and caregivers (Sanders et al., 2014; Reeves et al., 2017). Purpose: The purpose of this project is to evaluate stroke knowledge retention among Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), stroke survivors or caregivers when they return home (14ndash30 days after discharge). Specifically, this project analyzed selected demographics (age, gender, type of stroke, discharge location) and assessed 1) stroke knowledge (stroke type and risk factors) and 2) the impact of the stroke education book (did they remember receiving the book and if so did they refer to it and was it helpful) that was provided to the patient and caregivers by the Comprehensive Stroke Center. Design and Methods: A quality improvement project which performed a secondary analysis of data that has been previously collected by a Comprehensive Stroke Center Transition of Care program ± 30 days post hospital discharge. Data that has been collected included patient demographics, stroke knowledge and usefulness of a newly developed stroke education book. Results: Reponses of patients and caregivers (N = 105) were included. The sample included mostly ischemic stroke and TIA patients. Less than half of the participants said they received stroke education or the newly developed stroke education book even though, according to the stroke coordinator, there is nearly 100% compliance in providing stroke education book documented in patients’ charts. Further, more than half of the participants who said they received a stroke education book did not refer to the book for any reason. Some of the participants who read the book reported not understanding it. Conclusion: There is lack of knowledge regarding stroke diagnosis and risk factors despite having educational material provided to patients/caregivers. A stroke education book is likely necessary but is not sufficient. There is a need for developing active, individualized in-hospital education as well as a need for early discharge follow up to reinforce education in order to ensure safe transitions when patients return home after experiencing stroke.

Abstract: Objective To measure long‐term knowledge gain after provision of nursing education in a low‐income country. Design and Sample Global health education research has often focused on the short‐ term effects of providing education and direct patient care. Assessment of long‐term knowledge gain is key for determining whether education knowledge transfer is sustainable. Measurements This prospective cohort study of educational training for nurses in Haiti tested knowledge gain before, immediately after, and 6 months after education. Intervention Quantitative assessments were obtained through multiple choice tests at 3 time points. Qualitative data were obtained through focus groups and self‐assessments. Results Knowledge gain was significant from pretest to immediate posttest, and knowledge retention was assessed at 6 months after the education. Qualitative data showed improvement in reported confidence levels and patient care activities. Short‐term knowledge gain was statistically significant for improvement; however, long‐term knowledge gain was statistically significant in only 4 of 19 lectures. Conclusions Reported qualitative improvements in patient care indicated added value of providing education to the nursing staff. Hands‐on learning techniques were important to long‐term retention, and building trust was vital to the completion of our study.

Abstract: To ascertain whether simulation-based teaching is superior to lecture-based teaching for an induction programme using a home-made induction model. OBJECTIVE To ascertain whether simulation-based teaching is superior to lecture-based teaching for an induction programme using a home-made induction model.A simulation-based induction programme was designed and separate lecture-based teaching covering the same content was organised for junior doctors. The junior doctors were asked to complete pre- and post-induction surveys regarding confidence and anxiety levels. The skills taught included microsuction, flexible nasendoscopy, and anterior and posterior nasal packing. Structured interviews were conducted after the programme to gain qualitative data for analysis. The trainees' knowledge retention was compared using a standardised written assessment one month after the session. METHODS A simulation-based induction programme was designed and separate lecture-based teaching covering the same content was organised for junior doctors.

RESULTS Simulation-based teaching using the induction model was associated with a statistically significant increase in confidence levels and reduction in anxiety levels, and was associated with greater knowledge retention.A regular simulation induction programme should be introduced using the induction model, as it leads to better knowledge retention and increased confidence levels. CONCLUSION A regular simulation induction programme should be introduced using the induction model, as it leads to better knowledge retention and increased confidence levels.

Abstract: Santa Ana, California has the highest teenage birth rate in Orange County, USA, at 28.2 per 1,000 women aged 15-19 as compared to 12.0 per 1000 women of similar age elsewhere in the county. In the light of this disparity, University of California Irvine medical students surveyed a convenience sample of 9th grade students (aged 14-15 years) in Santa Ana to assess the efficacy of a medical student-led sex education programme. Nine 50-minute sex education lessons were conducted over a 2-week period, with pre- and post-tests to evaluate knowledge retention. A total of 301 pre-tests and 295 post-tests were collected. Of 27 multiple choice questions, the mean number of correct questions on the pre-test was 11.3 (± 4.2) compared to 14.1 (± 5.0) questions on the post-test. There was significant improvement in scores following the implementation of the curriculum (p < 0.001). Overall, findings demonstrate that medical students can effectively teach a sex education curriculum. The study serves as a potential model for sex education in geographic areas that exhibit disparities in teenage birth rates.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of pediatric first-aid training methods on caregivers' and teachers' knowledge retention. OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of pediatric first-aid training methods on caregivers' and teachers' knowledge retention.This was a randomized longitudinal cohort study. STUDY DESIGN This was a randomized longitudinal cohort study.A stratified random sampling method was used to select 1282 caregivers and teachers with the help of local education authorities in 18 districts and 1 county of Shanghai, China. The selected caregivers and teachers were randomly allocated into groups that were exposed to 3 models of training, including an interactive training model (group A), lecture-based training model (group B), and video instruction training model (group C), for pediatric first-aid training for caregivers and teachers (PedFACTs). Before and after the training, a descriptive questionnaire composed of demographic information and 37 simple-choice questions about first aid was administered. During the follow-up, 120 caregivers and teachers from each of the three methods were randomized and retested 9 months after their training and 120 caregivers and teachers were randomly reselected in each of the three methods and retested 4 years after their training. METHODS A stratified random sampling method was used to select 1282 caregivers and teachers with the help of local education authorities in 18 districts and 1 county of Shanghai, China. The selected caregivers and teachers were randomly allocated into groups that were exposed to 3 models of training, including an interactive training model (group A), lecture-based training model (group B), and video instruction training model (group C), for pediatric first-aid training for caregivers and teachers (PedFACTs). Before and after the training, a descriptive questionnaire composed of demographic information and 37 simple-choice questions about first aid was administered. During the follow-up, 120 caregivers and teachers from each of the three methods were randomized and retested 9 months after their training and 120 caregivers and teachers were randomly reselected in each of the three methods and retested 4 years after their training.Immediately after training, there was a significant difference in the postassessment results between groups A and B (P = 0.002) as well as between groups A and C (P < 0.001). The average interactive training model score was the highest, followed by the instruction training model and video instruction training model. There was no significant difference among the three groups in the reassessment scores at 9 months and 4 years after training (P = 0.744, P = 0.595). The difference in passing the assessment among the three groups at 9 months or 4 years after training was not maintained at a significant level. RESULTS Immediately after training, there was a significant difference in the postassessment results between groups A and B (P = 0.002) as well as between groups A and C (P < 0.001). The average interactive training model score was the highest, followed by the instruction training model and video instruction training model. There was no significant difference among the three groups in the reassessment scores at 9 months and 4 years after training (P = 0.744, P = 0.595). The difference in passing the assessment among the three groups at 9 months or 4 years after training was not maintained at a significant level.The three training methods did not affect knowledge retention of the caregivers and teachers at nine months or four years after training completion. Video instruction may be an effective, convenient, and feasible method to train caregivers and teachers.
