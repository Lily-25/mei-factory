The Agent aims to measure customer experience via UGC (user generated content), such as comments on social media platform
The model I used is experience Quality (EXQ) Model via UGC defined by Klaus & Maklan (2013).

1. Experience Quality (EXQ) Model via UGC
Use: 
    Measures customer experience across dimensions like peace of mind, moments of truth, product experience, outcome focus.
    Adaptation for social media: Researchers code user-generated content (reviews, posts, comments) into these dimensions instead of survey responses.
Advantage: 
    Strong academic legitimacy, flexible across industries. 
Framework: 
    The EXQ model (Klaus & Maklan, 2013) measures customer experience across four key dimensions:
    Product Experience – perceptions of the physical service/product itself (e.g., park facilities, autonomous vehicles).
    Outcome Focus – whether the visitor feels their goals were achieved (e.g., relaxation, fun, safe travel).
    Moments of Truth – critical interactions where the experience succeeds or fails (e.g., boarding the self-driving shuttle, ticketing).
    Peace of Mind – emotional state, trust, safety, and stress reduction (e.g., feeling safe with AVs, enjoying nature).

2. Data Crawl
    capture picture or text from social media platform  --> unify the format in text
                (crawl or manual with keywords)               (llm: text extraction)
    For example
        Someone want to analyze EX via the post from customers on a mobile social media application which doesn't open data in batch. 
        The only way to get these data is browsing the picture via the app so that the analyzer need to 
         - filter the information with keywords 
         - nap a series of pictures as the raw materials
         - use tools to extract the text from these pictures 
         - store these text data as the input
